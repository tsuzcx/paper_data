However, additional classification information is available from the phase shift introduced by some targets as a result of the acoustic boundary conditions. For example, reverberation returns from the sea surface and from the swimbladders of various fish introduce an additional phase shift that is not usually present in returns from the seabed or man-made targets. Techniques based on the use of sub-band correlators are presented for measuring the phase shifts associated with certain stationary and moving targets when insonified by broadband transmissions. The performance of the target-phase measurement technique is derived for transmit signals used in existing sonar systems such as continuous wave (CW), linear frequency-modulated (LFM), and hyperbolic frequency-modulated (HFM) pulses in the presence of target or platform motion. The use of HFM signal processing with sub-band correlators to measure the Doppler shift of very slowly moving targets is presented. Modifications to sinusoidal frequency-modulated (SFM) and HFM transmission types are proposed in order to maintain a good compromise between overall detection and target-phase classification performance, i.e., between range resolution and phase measurement. Field trial results are presented for a plankton classification sonar system and a collision-avoidance system designed for operation near the sea surface. </para>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4200692/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 May 2007","dateOfInsertion":"15 May 2007","publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"9471331","volume":"1","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Transmit-Signal Design and Processing Strategies for Sonar Target Phase Measurement","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Transmit-Signal Design and Processing Strategies for Sonar Target Phase Measurement","sourcePdf":"01jstsp01-atkins.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.036148S","chronDate":"June  2007","isNumber":"4200691","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4200690","citationCount":"30","articleId":"4200692","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-23"},{"_id":4200693,"authors":[{"name":"John J.

In practice, therefore, the modeling will need to be assessed and possibly extended, and additionally a means of measuring the \"in-situ\" clutter/reverberation spectrum will be required. The advantages of our approach are that a simple analytical result is obtained which is guaranteed to be optimal, and also the extension to spatial-temporal signal design is immediate using ideas of frequency-wavenumber representations. Some examples are given to illustrate the signal design procedure as well as the calculation of the increase in processing gain. Finally, the results are shown to be an extension of the usual procedure which places the signal energy in the noise band having minimum power","doi":"10.1109/JSTSP.2007.897046","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4200690/4200691/04200703.pdf","startPage":"31","endPage":"41","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSTSP.2007.897046","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4200691","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal Signal Design for Detection of Gaussian Point Targets in Stationary Gaussian Clutter/Reverberation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4200703","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 May 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4200703/","displayDocTitle":"Optimal Signal Design for Detection of Gaussian Point Targets in Stationary Gaussian Clutter/Reverberation","volume":"1","issue":"1","publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"9471326","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4200703/","dateOfInsertion":"15 May 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal Signal Design for Detection of Gaussian Point Targets in Stationary Gaussian Clutter/Reverberation","sourcePdf":"01jstsp01-kay.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.058713S","chronDate":"June  2007","xplore-pub-id":"4200690","isNumber":"4200691","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4200690","citationCount":"176","xplore-issue":"4200691","articleId":"4200703","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4200704,"authors":[{"name":"Ctlin Lacatus","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Texas, San Antonio, San Antonio, TX, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4200690/4200691/4200704/4200704-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["C\u0103t\u0103lin L\u0103c\u0103tu\u015f received the Electrical Engineering Diploma with specialization in radar systems in 1994 from the Military Technical Academy, Bucharest, Romania.

The algorithm is derived using a game-theoretic approach in which separable cost functions with respect to codeword and power are defined, and joint codeword and power adaptation is formulated as a separable game with two corresponding subgames: the noncooperative codeword adaptation game, and the noncooperative power control game. Codeword and power adaptation use incremental updates in the direction of the best strategy, which are desirable in practical implementations since they allow the receiver to follow transmitter changes with corresponding incremental changes of the receiver filter and continue detection of transmitted symbols with high accuracy. The algorithm can also track variable target SINRs or variable number of active users in the system, and is therefore useful for dynamic wireless systems with varying quality of service (QoS) requirements. We illustrate the proposed algorithm with numerical examples obtained from simulations that show convergence and tracking properties of the algorithm for different scenarios","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive Interference Avoidance for Dynamic Wireless Systems: A Game Theoretic Approach","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/JSTSP.2007.897060","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4200690/4200691/04200704.pdf","startPage":"189","endPage":"202","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSTSP.2007.897060","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4200691","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4200704","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4200704/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 May 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2007","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive Interference Avoidance for Dynamic Wireless Systems: A Game Theoretic Approach","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"1","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/4200704/","dateOfInsertion":"15 May 2007","publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"9471340","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive Interference Avoidance for Dynamic Wireless Systems: A Game Theoretic Approach","sourcePdf":"01jstsp01-lacatus.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.139341S","chronDate":"June  2007","xplore-pub-id":"4200690","isNumber":"4200691","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4200690","citationCount":"34","xplore-issue":"4200691","articleId":"4200704","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4200705,"authors":[{"name":"Amir Leshem","affiliation":["School of Engineering, Bar-llan University, Ramat-Gan, Israel"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4200690/4200691/4200705/4200705-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Amir Leshem received the B.

One potential enabler for these capabilities is software-defined radio (SDR). When controlled by cognitive radio (CR) principles, the required waveform diversity is achieved through a synergistic union called CR-based SDR. This paper introduces a general framework for analyzing, characterizing, and implementing spectrally modulated, spectrally encoded (SMSE) signals within CR-based SDR architectures. Given orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) is one 4G candidate signal, OFDM-based signals are collectively classified as SMSE since data modulation and encoding are applied in the spectral domain. The proposed framework provides analytic commonality and unification of multiple SMSE signals. Framework applicability and flexibility is demonstrated for candidate 4G signals by: 1) showing that resultant analytic expressions are consistent with published results and 2) presenting representative modeling and simulation results to reinforce practical utility","doi":"10.1109/JSTSP.2007.897061","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4200690/4200691/04200710.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSTSP.2007.897061","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4200691","startPage":"203","endPage":"213","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Communication Waveform Design Using an Adaptive Spectrally Modulated, Spectrally Encoded (SMSE) Framework","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4200710","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Communication Waveform Design Using an Adaptive Spectrally Modulated, Spectrally Encoded (SMSE) Framework","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4200710/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 May 2007","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"1","issue":"1","publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"9471341","dateOfInsertion":"15 May 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4200710/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Communication Waveform Design Using an Adaptive Spectrally Modulated, Spectrally Encoded (SMSE) Framework","sourcePdf":"01jstsp01-roberts.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.106269S","chronDate":"June  2007","xplore-pub-id":"4200690","isNumber":"4200691","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4200690","citationCount":"31","xplore-issue":"4200691","articleId":"4200710","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4200711,"authors":[{"name":"Geoffrey San Antonio","affiliation":["Electronic Systems and Signals Research Laboratory, Department of Electrical and Systems Engineering, Washington University, Saint Louis, MO, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4200690/4200691/4200711/4200711-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Geoffrey San Antonio received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering from Worcester Polytechnic Institute, Worcester, MA, in 2003 and the M.S. degree in electrical engineering from Washington University, St. Louis, MO, in 2005.

However, theory and methods for exploiting the potential of reconfigurable RF front-ends are not fully developed. In this paper, we study the impact of reconfigurable antenna arrays on maximizing the capacity of multiple input multiple output (MIMO) wireless communication links in sparse multipath environments. There is growing experimental evidence that physical wireless channels exhibit a sparse multipath structure, even at relatively low antenna dimensions. We propose a model for sparse multipath channels and show that sparse channels afford a new dimension over which capacity can be optimized: the distribution or configuration of the sparse statistically independent degrees of freedom (DoF) in the available spatial signal space dimensions. Our results show that the configuration of the sparse DoF has a profound impact on capacity and also characterize the optimal capacity-maximizing channel configuration at any operating SNR. We then develop a framework for realizing the optimal channel configuration at any SNR by systematically adapting the antenna spacings at the transmitter and the receiver to the level of sparsity in the physical multipath environment. Surprisingly, three canonical array configurations are sufficient for near-optimum performance over the entire SNR range. In a sparse scattering environment with randomly distributed paths, the capacity gain due to the optimal configuration is directly proportional to the number of antennas. Numerical results based on a realistic physical model are presented to illustrate the implications of our framework","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4200712/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 May 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2007","volume":"1","issue":"1","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9471337","dateOfInsertion":"15 May 2007","publicationDate":"June 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4200712/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Maximizing MIMO Capacity in Sparse Multipath With Reconfigurable Antenna Arrays","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Maximizing MIMO Capacity in Sparse Multipath With Reconfigurable Antenna Arrays","sourcePdf":"01jstsp01-sayeed.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.099846S","chronDate":"June  2007","xplore-pub-id":"4200690","isNumber":"4200691","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4200690","citationCount":"120","xplore-issue":"4200691","articleId":"4200712","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4200713,"authors":[{"name":"Sandeep P.

Three criteria are presented and discussed in detail, which involve: 1) minimizing the average uncoded block error rate, 2) maximizing the ergodic mutual information, and 3) a two-step procedure considering the optimization of the ergodic mutual information as well as the average uncoded block error rate, respectively. For any set of subcarriers, any number of OFDM symbol intervals, any number of transmit/receive antennas and any statistical fading channel model, the corresponding optimized LD code matrices are numerically computed via a stochastic gradient descent algorithm assuming either maximum likelihood or linear zero-forcing decoding. As an application of the proposed criteria, code design examples are presented for practical next-generation communication systems which operate over a realistic 3GPP spatial channel model. The robustness of the resulting codes over several operating conditions is comprehensively demonstrated via numerical simulations","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4200690/4200691/04200714.pdf","startPage":"178","endPage":"188","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/JSTSP.2007.897059","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSTSP.2007.897059","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4200691","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4200714","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design of Linear Dispersion Codes for Practical MIMO-OFDM Systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Broadband antennas","MIMO","OFDM","Error analysis","Mutual information","Receiving antennas","Fading","Stochastic processes","Maximum likelihood decoding","Robustness"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["3G mobile communication","antenna arrays","error statistics","gradient methods","linear codes","matrix algebra","maximum likelihood decoding","MIMO communication","OFDM modulation","space-time codes","stochastic processes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO-OFDM systems","space-time-frequency linear dispersion codes","multiple-input multiple-output antenna systems","orthogonal-frequency-division-multiplexing","uncoded block error rate","ergodic mutual information","statistical fading channel model","transmit antennas","receive antennas","LD code matrices","stochastic gradient descent algorithm","maximum likelihood decoding","linear zero-forcing decoding","3GPP spatial channel model"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["3GPP spatial channel model (SCM)","frequency-selective channels","LD codes","multiple-input multiple-output orthogonal-frequency-division-multiplexing (MIMO-OFDM)","stochastic approximation","subcarrier grouping"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4200714/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 May 2007","displayDocTitle":"Design of Linear Dispersion Codes for Practical MIMO-OFDM Systems","volume":"1","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/4200714/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"9471339","dateOfInsertion":"15 May 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design of Linear Dispersion Codes for Practical MIMO-OFDM Systems","sourcePdf":"01jstsp01-venturino.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.10327S","chronDate":"June  2007","xplore-pub-id":"4200690","isNumber":"4200691","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4200690","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"4200691","articleId":"4200714","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":4200715,"authors":[{"name":"Yang Yang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Lehigh University, Bethlehem, PA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4200690/4200691/4200715/4200715-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yang Yang (S'05) received the B.

Recognizing that a single, precise characterization of target power spectral density (PSD) is rare in practice, we assume the PSD lies in an uncertainty class of spectra bounded by known upper and lower bounds, which markedly relaxes the required target a priori knowledge. Based on this band model, we develop minimax robust waveforms for MIMO radar under both MMSE and MI criteria. These robust waveforms bound the worst-case performance at an acceptable limit, and also could insure performance will be sufficiently good for any PSD in the uncertainty class.

In contrast with standard tandem coding schemes, where the redundancy is introduced after source coding, it is introduced before source coding using real BCH codes. A joint channel model is first presented. The model corresponds to a memoryless mixture of Gaussian and Bernoulli-Gaussian noise. It may represent the source coder, the channel coder, the physical channel, and their corresponding decoder. Decoding algorithms are derived from this channel model and compared to a state-of-art real BCH decoding scheme. A further comparison with two reference tandem coding schemes and the proposed joint coding scheme for the robust transmission of still images has been presented. When the tandem scheme is not accurately tuned, the joint coding scheme outperforms the tandem scheme in all situations. Compared to a tandem scheme well tuned for a given channel situation, the joint coding scheme shows an increased robustness as the channel conditions worsen. The soft performance degradation observed when the channel worsens gives an additional advantage to the joint source-channel coding scheme for fading channels, since a reconstruction with moderate quality may be still possible, even if the channel is in a deep fade","doi":"10.1109/TIP.2007.896698","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4200748","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIP.2007.896698","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/83/4200748/04200758.pdf","startPage":"1568","endPage":"1583","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint Source-Channel Coding Using Real BCH Codes for Robust Image Transmission","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 May 2007","displayDocTitle":"Joint Source-Channel Coding Using Real BCH Codes for Robust Image Transmission","volume":"16","issue":"6","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2007","dateOfInsertion":"15 May 2007","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4200758/","publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"9460392","pubMedId":"17547135","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4200758/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint Source-Channel Coding Using Real BCH Codes for Robust Image Transmission","sourcePdf":"16tip06-gabay.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.106886S","chronDate":"June  2007","xplore-pub-id":"83","isNumber":"4200748","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"38","xplore-issue":"4200748","articleId":"4200758","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4200759,"authors":[{"name":"Marco Grangetto","affiliation":["Center for Multimedia Radio Communications CERCOM, Department of Electronics, Politecnico di Turino, Torino, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/83/4200748/4200759/4200759-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Marco Grangetto (S'99\u2013M'03) received the degree (summa cum laude) in electrical engineering and the Ph.D. degree from the Politecnico di Torino, Torino, Italy, in 1999 and 2003, respectively.","He is currently a Postdoctoral Researcher at the Image Processing Laboratory, Politecnico di Torino.

The proposed approach enables iterative soft decoding of arithmetic codes by means of a soft-in soft-out decoder based on suboptimal search and pruning of a binary tree. An error-resilient arithmetic coder with a forbidden symbol is used in order to improve the performance of the joint source/channel scheme. The performance in the case of transmission across the AWGN channel is evaluated in terms of word error probability and compared to a traditional separated approach. The interleaver gain, the convergence property of the system, and the optimal source/channel rate allocation are investigated. Finally, the practical relevance of the proposed joint decoding approach is demonstrated within the JPEG 2000 coding standard. In particular, an iterative channel and JPEG 2000 decoder is designed and tested in the case of image transmission across the AWGN channel","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 May 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4200759/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2007","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"16","issue":"6","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"June 2007","dateOfInsertion":"15 May 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4200759/","accessionNumber":"9460391","pubMedId":"17547134","displayDocTitle":"Iterative Decoding of Serially Concatenated Arithmetic and Channel Codes With JPEG 2000 Applications","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Iterative Decoding of Serially Concatenated Arithmetic and Channel Codes With JPEG 2000 Applications","sourcePdf":"16tip06-grangetto.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.079795S","chronDate":"June  2007","xplore-pub-id":"83","isNumber":"4200748","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"24","xplore-issue":"4200748","articleId":"4200759","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4200763,"authors":[{"name":"Karl S.

Prior to the study, the SVR problem is enhanced by finding the optimal kernel. This is done by formulating the kernel learning problem in SVR form as a convex optimization problem, specifically a semi-definite programming (SDP) problem. An additional constraint is added to reduce the SDP to a quadratically constrained quadratic programming (QCQP) problem. After this optimization, investigation of the relevancy of SVR to superresolution proceeds with the possibility of using a single and general support vector regression for all image content, and the results are impressive for small training sets. This idea is improved upon by observing structural properties in the discrete cosine transform (DCT) domain to aid in learning the regression. Further improvement involves a combination of classification and SVR-based techniques, extending works in resolution synthesis. This method, termed kernel resolution synthesis, uses specific regressors for isolated image content to describe the domain through a partitioned look of the vector space, thereby yielding good results","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Image Superresolution Using Support Vector Regression","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","doi":"10.1109/TIP.2007.896644","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/83/4200748/04200763.pdf","startPage":"1596","endPage":"1610","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIP.2007.896644","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4200748","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4200763","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4200763/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 May 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2007","displayDocTitle":"Image Superresolution Using Support Vector Regression","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"16","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/4200763/","dateOfInsertion":"15 May 2007","publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"9460394","pubMedId":"17547137","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Image Superresolution Using Support Vector Regression","sourcePdf":"16tip06-ni.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.183331S","chronDate":"June  2007","xplore-pub-id":"83","isNumber":"4200748","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"195","xplore-issue":"4200748","articleId":"4200763","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":4200764,"authors":[{"name":"Mila Nikolova","affiliation":["Centre de Math\u00e9matiques et de Leures Applications, ENS Cachan, Cachan, France"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/83/4200748/4200764/4200764-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Mila Nikolova received the Ph.D. degree in signal processing from the Universit\u00e9 de Paris-Sud, Paris, France, in 1995.","Currently, she is a Senior Research Fellow with the National Center for Scientific Research (CNRS), France, and performs her research at the Centre de Math\u00e9matiques et de Leurs Applications (CMLA), ENS de Cachan, France.

Mainly because of the latter term, the calculation of the solution is slow and cumbersome. Half-quadratic (HQ) minimization (multiplicative form) was pioneered by Geman and Reynolds (1992) in order to alleviate the computational task in the context of image reconstruction with nonconvex regularization. By promoting the idea of locally homogeneous image models with a continuous-valued line process, they reformulated the optimization problem in terms of an augmented cost function which is quadratic with respect to the image and separable with respect to the line process, hence the name \"half quadratic.\" Since then, a large amount of papers were dedicated to HQ minimization and important results-including edge-preservation along with convex regularization and convergence-have been obtained. In this paper, we show that HQ minimization (multiplicative form) is equivalent to the most simple and basic method where the gradient of the cost function is linearized at each iteration step. In fact, both methods give exactly the same iterations. Furthermore, connections of HQ minimization with other methods, such as the quasi-Newton method and the generalized Weiszfeld's method, are straightforward","doi":"10.1109/TIP.2007.896622","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/83/4200748/04200764.pdf","startPage":"1623","endPage":"1627","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIP.2007.896622","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4200748","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The Equivalence of Half-Quadratic Minimization and the Gradient Linearization Iteration","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4200764","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 May 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4200764/","displayDocTitle":"The Equivalence of Half-Quadratic Minimization and the Gradient Linearization Iteration","volume":"16","issue":"6","publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"9460396","pubMedId":"17547139","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4200764/","dateOfInsertion":"15 May 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Equivalence of Half-Quadratic Minimization and the Gradient Linearization Iteration","sourcePdf":"16tip06-nikolova.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.088324S","chronDate":"June  2007","xplore-pub-id":"83","isNumber":"4200748","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"77","xplore-issue":"4200748","articleId":"4200764","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":4200773,"authors":[{"name":"Markus Puschel","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/83/4200748/4200773/4200773-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Markus P\u00fcschel (M'99\u2013SM'05) received the Diploma (M.Sc.) degree in mathematics and the Doctorate (Ph.D.) degree in computer science from the University of Karlsruhe, Karlsruhe, Germany, in 1995 and 1998, respectively.","He is an Associate Research Professor of electrical and computer engineering at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU), Pittsburgh, PA.

Namely, we construct the proper signal models, given by polynomial algebras, bottom-up from a suitable definition of hexagonal space shifts using a procedure provided by the algebraic theory.

The \"inverse\" of this problem is one of modeling how even a clear image can be perceived to be blurred in certain contexts. To our knowledge, there is no solution to this in the literature other than for an oversimplified model in which the true image is garbled with noise by the perceiver himself. In this paper, we propose a chaotic model of pattern recognition (PR) for the theory of \"blurring.\" This paper, which is an extension to a companion paper demonstrates how one can model blurring from the view point of a chaotic PR system. Unlike the companion paper in which a chaotic PR system extracts the pattern from the input, in this case, we show that even without the inclusion of additional noise, perception of an object can be \"blurred\" if the dynamics of the chaotic system are modified. We thus propose a formal model and present an analysis using the Lyapunov exponents and the Routh-Hurwitz criterion. We also demonstrate experimentally the validity of our model by using a numeral data set. A byproduct of this model is the theoretical possibility of desynchronization of the periodic behavior of the brain (as a chaotic system), rendering us the possibility of predicting, controlling, and

As the sampled-data fuzzy controller can be implemented by a microcontroller or a digital computer, the implementation time and cost can be reduced. However, the sampling activity and time delay, which are potential causes of system instability, will complicate the system dynamics and make the stability analysis much more difficult than that for a pure continuous-time fuzzy control system. In this paper, a sampled-data fuzzy controller with enhanced nonlinearity compensation ability is proposed. Based on the fuzzy-model-based control approach, linear matrix inequality (LMI)-based stability conditions are derived to guarantee the system stability. By using a descriptor representation, the complexity of the sampled-data fuzzy control system with time delay can be reduced to ease the stability analysis, which effectively leads to a smaller number of LMI-stability conditions. Information of the membership functions of both the fuzzy plant model and fuzzy controller are considered, which allows arbitrary matrices to be introduced, to ease the satisfaction of the stability conditions. An application example will be given to show the merits and design procedure of the proposed approach.

On the other hand, permutation-based GA (PGA) is applied for both performing exploration in permutation-based scheduling space and stressing exploitation for good schedule solutions. To evaluate solutions in multiobjective sense, a randomly weighted linear-sum function is used in QGA, and a nondominated sorting technique including classification of Pareto fronts and fitness assignment is applied in PGA with regard to both proximity and diversity of solutions.

This algorithm effectively combines multiobjective optimization with global and local search models. In performing the global search, a niching genetic algorithm based on tournament selection is proposed. Also, HCOEA has adopted a parallel local search operator that implements a clustering partition of the population and multiparent crossover to generate the offspring population. Then, nondominated individuals in the offspring population are used to replace the dominated individuals in the parent population. Meanwhile, the best infeasible individual replacement scheme is devised for the purpose of rapidly guiding the population toward the feasible region of the search space. During the evolutionary process, the global search model effectively promotes high population diversity, and the local search model remarkably accelerates the convergence speed. HCOEA is tested on 13 well-known benchmark functions, and the experimental results suggest that it is more robust and efficient than other state-of-the-art algorithms from the literature in terms of the selected performance metrics, such as the best, median, mean, and worst objective function values and the standard deviations","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4200820/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 May 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"9456004","pubMedId":"17550112","htmlLink":"/document/4200820/","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"15 May 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"37","issue":"3","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Multiobjective Optimization and Hybrid Evolutionary Algorithm to Solve Constrained Optimization Problems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multiobjective Optimization and Hybrid Evolutionary Algorithm to Solve Constrained Optimization Problems","sourcePdf":"37tsmcb03-wang2.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.145547S","chronDate":"June  2007","xplore-pub-id":"3477","isNumber":"4200791","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3477","citationCount":"182","xplore-issue":"4200791","articleId":"4200820","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4200847,"authors":[{"name":"Daniele Carnevale","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Informatica, Sistemi e Produzione, University of Roma Tor Vergata, Rome, Italy"],"firstName":"Daniele","lastName":"Carnevale","id":"37398441000"},{"name":"Andrew R.

In both methods, a zero-phase filter that is designed in the frequency domain is applied in order to provide compensation for the resonant peak in the system model to ensure error convergence. Furthermore, a \"forgetting factor\" is introduced in both control algorithms to increase the robustness of the scheme against measurement noise, initialization error, and/or variation of system dynamics due to any parameter drift. In the direct ILC method, ILC is combined with the feedforward of the reference to improve dynamic performance. This method is shown to be capable of achieving very high steady-state performance although its dynamic response was not very good. In the hybrid ILC method, ILC is combined with a proportional-derivative controller aside from the reference feedforward to improve the dynamic response further. Experimental results show that both proposed controllers can achieve very low total harmonic distortion and fast error convergence under different loads while using only one sensor. The proposed direct ILC is an effective solution for UPS products where high-quality steady-state output voltage is more important than fast dynamic response, while hybrid ILC can result in excellent steady-state performance with a more improved dynamic response than direct ILC","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2007.894701","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2007.894701","startPage":"1739","endPage":"1751","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/41/4142913/04200881.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4142913","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis and Design of Iterative Learning Control Strategies for UPS Inverters","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 May 2007","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2007","displayDocTitle":"Analysis and Design of Iterative Learning Control Strategies for UPS Inverters","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2007","dateOfInsertion":"15 May 2007","volume":"54","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4200881/","accessionNumber":"9489043","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4200881/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis and Design of Iterative Learning Control Strategies for UPS Inverters","sourcePdf":"54tie03-deng.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.061578S","chronDate":"June  2007","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"4142913","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"83","xplore-issue":"4142913","articleId":"4200881","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-29"},{"_id":4200883,"authors":[{"name":"Jun Oh Jang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Control Engineering, Ui-Duk University, Kyongju, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/4142913/4200883/4200883-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jun Oh Jang received the B.S., M.S., and Ph.D. degrees in electronic engineering from Kyungpook National University, Taegu, Korea, in 1988, 1992, and 1998, respectively.","He is currently an Associate Professor in the Department of Computer Control Engineering, Uiduk University, Kyongju, Korea.

In this respect, the linear sampling method is an effective candidate to pursue this task. However, despite its simplicity and computational effectiveness, still its use is restricted to the mathematical community wherein it has been originally developed. Starting from this observation, in this paper we propose and test a simple and original \"physical\" interpretation of the linear sampling methods, which shows its relationship with electromagnetic focusing problems. Taking advantage of this result we discuss merits and limitations of the method and suggest new guidelines for a successful application.

In particular, the ADI-CFDTD method is an unconditionally stable time-domain method with second-order spatial accuracy, and allows the time step to be increased beyond the Courant-Friedrichs-Levy limit; it is suitable for electrically small problem (structure details much smaller than a wavelength) but is inefficient and suffers from large numerical errors for electrically large-scale regions. The PSTD method, on the other hand, is accurate and efficient for regions with large, relatively homogeneous materials, but loses its efficiency for electrically small structures. The hybrid PSTD/ADI-CFDTD method overcomes these disadvantages and is potentially more useful than the individual solvers.

To date, they have been applied extensively to the solution of elliptic and parabolic PDEs. This technique can be interpreted as a unified prescription of a host of well known techniques such as classical finite element methods that are based on tessellation, point cloud techniques, and element free Galerkin methods. The focus of this paper is to extend this technique to solve vector electromagnetic problems. However, modification of GFEM to address this problem poses a novel set of challenges: i) the vector nature of the problem and the different continuity requirements on each component imply that basis functions developed should share similar characteristics; ii) the basis functions have to be able to represent divergence free electromagnetic fields (in a source free region) when they themselves are not divergence free. These have been the primary impediments to extension of this technique. In this paper, we propose a method that may be used to overcome these obstacles, and will demonstrate h and p convergence characteristics of the proposed method for a range of problems. Finally, we will demonstrate convergence characteristics of this technique for analyzing scattering from a sharp wedge when the basis functions include analytical \"local\" field representation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel5/8/4200888/04200912.pdf","startPage":"1369","endPage":"1381","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","doi":"10.1109/TAP.2007.895572","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.2007.895572","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4200888","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4200912","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Generalized Finite Element Method for Vector Electromagnetic Problems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Finite element methods","Partial differential equations","Clouds","Convergence","Polynomials","Computational electromagnetics","Moment methods","Electromagnetic fields","Impedance","Electromagnetic scattering"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electromagnetic wave scattering","finite element analysis","partial differential equations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["generalized finite element method","GFEM","vector electromagnetic problem","partial differential equation","scalar PDE","divergence free electromagnetic field","convergence characteristics","scattering analysis"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Finite element methods (FEM)","meshless","partial differential equations","vector basis function"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4200912/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 May 2007","displayDocTitle":"Generalized Finite Element Method for Vector Electromagnetic Problems","volume":"55","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/4200912/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2007","accessionNumber":"9501591","dateOfInsertion":"15 May 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Generalized Finite Element Method for Vector Electromagnetic Problems","sourcePdf":"55tap05-lu.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.082672S","chronDate":"May  2007","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"4200888","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"34","xplore-issue":"4200888","articleId":"4200912","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4200913,"authors":[{"name":"Said M.

This design allows localization of bandpass characteristics to within a small area on the surface which in turn facilitates flexible spatial filtering for an arbitrary wave phasefront. The proposed FSS is made up of periodic array of metallic patches separated by thin air-gaps backed by a wire mesh having the same periodicity (Ltlambda). The array of metallic patches constitute a capacitive surface and the wire mesh a coupled inductive surface, which together act as a resonant structure in the path of an incident plane wave. Like traditional FSSs, the capacitive and inductive surfaces of the proposed FSS can easily be fabricated using printed circuit technology on both sides of microwave substrates. It is shown that by cascading such bandpass surfaces in a proper fashion, any arbitrary multipole filter or non-commensurate multiband response can be obtained. The frequency response of the proposed miniaturized-element frequency selective surface (MEFSS) is demonstrated for various incident angles and it is shown that one-pole designs are less sensitive than two-pole designs to the angle of incidence. Dual band designs are also possible based on two-pole designs, but are more sensitive to incident angle than single band designs because of their larger (in terms of wavelengths) spacing. Prototypes of single-pole and dual-pole MEFSSs are fabricated and tested in a waveguide environment at X-band frequencies and excellent agreements between the measured and simulated results are demonstrated","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel5/8/4200888/04200922.pdf","startPage":"1239","endPage":"1245","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","doi":"10.1109/TAP.2007.895567","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.2007.895567","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4200888","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4200922","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Frequency Selective Surface With Miniaturized Elements","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Frequency selective surfaces","Surface waves","Resonance","Band pass filters","Wire","Filtering","Air gaps","Coupling circuits","Printed circuits","Microwave technology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dipole antenna arrays","frequency response","frequency selective surfaces","microstrip antenna arrays","multifrequency antennas","printed circuits","slot antenna arrays","spatial filters","substrates"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["frequency selective surface","bandpass FSS","miniaturized element","MEFSS","resonant dipole","slot structure","spatial filtering","arbitrary wave phasefront","metallic patch periodic array","printed circuit technology","microwave substrate","frequency response","dual band design","waveguide environment","X-band frequency"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Bandpass radome","frequency selective surfaces (FSSs)","spatial filter"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4200922/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 May 2007","displayDocTitle":"A Frequency Selective Surface With Miniaturized Elements","volume":"55","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/4200922/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2007","accessionNumber":"9501581","dateOfInsertion":"15 May 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Frequency Selective Surface With Miniaturized Elements","sourcePdf":"55tap05-sarabandi.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.080379S","chronDate":"May  2007","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"4200888","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"378","xplore-issue":"4200888","articleId":"4200922","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4200925,"authors":[{"name":"Hao Gang Wang","affiliation":["EM Academy, University of Zhejiang, Zhejiang, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8/4200888/4200925/4200925-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Hao Gang Wang (M'04) was born in Guangdong province, China.

The difficulty in applying the interpolation approach lies in the additional rapidly changing phase term associated with the full-wave Green's functions. To enhance the efficiency and accuracy of the full-wave Green's function interpolation, a scattered point set consisting of two staggered Tartan grids in conjunction with radial basis function interpolation is employed. To further reduce the computational complexity, the QR factorization technique is applied to compress the low rank Green's function matrices.

We thus derive two blind data detectors: a time-domain data detector and a frequency-domain data detector. We also contribute a reduced complexity, suboptimal version of a time-domain data detector that performs robustly when the normalized Doppler rate is less than 3%. Our frequency-domain data detector and suboptimal time-domain data detector both result in integer least-squares (LS) problems. We propose the use of the V-BLAST detector and the sphere decoder. The time-domain data detector is not limited to the Doppler rates less than 3%, but cannot be posed as an integer LS problem. Our solution is to develop an iterative algorithm that starts from the suboptimal time-domain data detector output.

This novel list-sequential (LISS) decoder avoids most of the drawbacks of the classical sequential decoders, such as variable workload and erased frames when working within a turbo scheme.

We begin with a real-valued representation of the complex-valued system model, and show that we can achieve orthogonality between transmitted signals by applying a proper rotation to transmitted symbols. Compared with other closed-loop methods, the proposed scheme significantly reduces the processing complexity at both transmitter and receiver as well as the feedback overhead. We also combine the proposed orthogonalization method with antenna-selection techniques, and then discuss a criterion based on the minimum Euclidean distance between received vectors for selecting the optimal subset of multiple transmit antennas. Using geometrical properties of the receive constellations, we also present a simple antenna-selection metric for the proposed SM systems.

We formulate a global rule of optimal transmission power control that achieves optimality regardless of the delay and reliability constraints. Then we extend it to encompass the multi-hop case by dividing the overall problem into two subproblems-energy determination for each ARQ stage and energy distribution among the constituent nodes. We show that the optimality condition established for the single-hop case is also applicable to solve the energy determination problem in the multi-hop case, rendering an optimal solution to the energy distribution problem.

This paper addresses three problems in multiuser diversity for OFDMA systems. First, we propose a way to significantly reduce the amount of channel state information (CSI) feedback without sacrificing performance too much, by selective and adaptive feedback. Second, we propose a way to increase the cell throughput and fairness by applying an opportunistic beamforming scheme to orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing. This beamforming scheme increases the frequency fading rate, which increases the multiuser diversity effect. Thirdly, we deal with the issue of fairness and quality-of-service (QoS) in opportunistic systems by proposing a modified proportional fair (PF) scheduler for OFDMA. Key features in the scheduler are that it incorporates QoS classes into the PF scheduler and that it has a tunable fairness level. Extensive simulation results are presented to evaluate the performance of the proposed schemes. The opportunistic beamforming scheme performed well in comparison with several other schemes.

It achieves multiuser diversity gain without substantial feedback requirements. The proposed strategy uses per-antenna scheduling at the base station, which maps each transmit antenna at the base station (equivalently, a spatial channel) to a user. Each user has a number of receive antennas that is greater than or equal to the number of transmit antennas at the base station. Zero-forcing receivers are deployed by each user to decode the transmitted data streams. In this system, the base station requires users' channel quality on each spatial channel for scheduling. An opportunistic feedback protocol is proposed to reduce the feedback requirements. The proposed protocol uses a contention channel that consists of a fixed number of feedback minislots to convey channel state information. Feedback control parameters including the channel quality threshold and the random access feedback probability are jointly adjusted to maximize the average throughput performance of this system. Multiple receive antennas at the base station are used on the feedback channel to allow decoding multiple feedback messages sent simultaneously by different users. This further reduces the bandwidth of the feedback channel. Iterative search algorithms are proposed to solve the optimization for selection of these parameters under both scenarios that the cumulative distribution functions of users are known or unknown to the base station","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/4200928/04200962.pdf","startPage":"1020","endPage":"1032","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2007.896013","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2007.896013","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4200928","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4200962","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Opportunistic Feedback for Multiuser MIMO Systems With Linear Receivers","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Base stations","Receiving antennas","Transmitting antennas","Access protocols","Downlink","Diversity methods","Decoding","State feedback","Channel state information"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","iterative decoding","MIMO communication","multiuser channels","protocols","radio receivers","scheduling","search problems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiuser MIMO systems","linear receivers","multiuser scheduling","multiple-input multiple-output downlink","antenna scheduling","transmit antenna","receive antennas","zero-forcing receivers","channel quality","spatial channel","opportunistic feedback protocol","contention channel","channel state information","channel quality threshold","random access feedback probability","decoding","feedback channel","iterative search algorithms","cumulative distribution functions"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Diversity methods","feedback","multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems","multiuser channels","scheduling"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4200962/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 May 2007","displayDocTitle":"Opportunistic Feedback for Multiuser MIMO Systems With Linear Receivers","volume":"55","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/4200962/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2007","accessionNumber":"9457858","dateOfInsertion":"15 May 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Opportunistic Feedback for Multiuser MIMO Systems With Linear Receivers","sourcePdf":"55tcomm05-tang.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.127703S","chronDate":"May  2007","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"4200928","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"54","xplore-issue":"4200928","articleId":"4200962","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4200963,"authors":[{"name":"Jie Wu","affiliation":["Qualcomm, Inc., San Diego, CA, USA","Electrical, Computer and Systems Engineering Department, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Troy, NY, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/4200928/4200963/4200963-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jie Wu received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in electrical engineering from Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, in 1997 and 1999, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Troy, NY, in 2004. communication receiver design.","He was with Nokia, San Diego, CA, as a Senior DSP Design Engineer from August 2004 to August 2006.

However, such centralized CSI can be impractical for a broadband wireless communication system with a large number of mobile users (MUs). In this paper, we propose a decentralized method to exploit the multiuser diversity in a single cell scenario with orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) based downlink. The central part of our approach is the channel-aware ALOHA-based OFDM subcarrier assignment. According to it, each MU measures the channel at all OFDM subcarriers and tries to obtain proper ones by sending a service-request packet through the corresponding orthogonal uplink subchannel. This packet is sent when the measured channel-fading level exceeds a predetermined threshold xi. The base station processes these request packets with a collision-reception model, and assigns the corresponding subcarrier(s) to the MU whose request packet has been successfully received. Two implementation algorithms are developed, by solving the problem of optimization of xi under different system configurations. Computer simulations show that in comparison with the standard round-robin method, the proposed algorithms offer a substantial data-rate improvement, especially when the correlation property of the OFDM subcarriers is properly exploited","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2007.896071","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/4200928/04200964.pdf","startPage":"953","endPage":"962","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2007.896071","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4200928","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Channel-Aware ALOHA-Based OFDM Subcarrier Assignment in Single-Cell Wireless Communications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4200964","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 May 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4200964/","displayDocTitle":"Channel-Aware ALOHA-Based OFDM Subcarrier Assignment in Single-Cell Wireless Communications","volume":"55","issue":"5","publicationDate":"May 2007","accessionNumber":"9457851","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4200964/","dateOfInsertion":"15 May 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Channel-Aware ALOHA-Based OFDM Subcarrier Assignment in Single-Cell Wireless Communications","sourcePdf":"55tcomm05-xue.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.06951S","chronDate":"May  2007","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"4200928","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"4200928","articleId":"4200964","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4200965,"authors":[{"name":"Yinghui Li","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Texas, Dallas, Richardson, TX, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/4200928/4200965/4200965-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yinghui Li (S'05) received the B.E. and M.S. degrees in electrical engineering from Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Nanjing, China, in 2000 and 2003, respectively.

We describe two design approaches, namely, consistency in the probabilistic sense and absolute consistency. Existing preambles and pilot designs in the literature do not guarantee the absolute consistency. We derive general criteria for both approaches, present sufficient conditions on the pilot structures over the maximum carrier frequency offset (CFO) estimation range (half of the sampling rate), and derive simple pilot designs satisfying these conditions. We also extend the sufficient conditions to any arbitrary but fixed CFO estimation range, and present some generalized design patterns. Furthermore, the CFO estimation performances of distinct consistent pilot designs can be quite different at moderate or low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) due to different statistics of outliers which also yields a link failure. We develop efficient pilot-design criteria that provide both consistency and robustness against outliers at moderate-to-low SNR. Our consistent pilot designs facilitate flexible and economical implementation, while our robust pilot designs enable wireless links with less outage and better resilience","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Frequency estimation","OFDM","Sufficient conditions","Robustness","Frequency division multiplexing","Frequency-selective fading channels","Sampling methods","Yield estimation","Signal design","Signal to noise ratio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fading channels","frequency estimation","matrix algebra","OFDM modulation","radio links"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["consistent frequency-offset estimation","OFDM systems","orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing systems","frequency-selective fading channels","maximum carrier frequency offset estimation","signal-to-noise ratio","SNR","wireless links"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Bose\u2013Chaudhuri\u2013Hocquengem (BCH) code","consistency","cyclic-difference set","frequency offset","m-sequence","maximum-likelihood (ML) estimation","orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM)","outlier","pilot design","robustness"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2007.896105","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/4200928/04200965.pdf","startPage":"864","endPage":"877","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4200928","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2007.896105","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Pilot Designs for Consistent Frequency-Offset Estimation in OFDM Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4200965","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Pilot Designs for Consistent Frequency-Offset Estimation in OFDM Systems","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4200965/","volume":"55","issue":"5","publicationDate":"May 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4200965/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"9457842","dateOfInsertion":"15 May 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 May 2007","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Pilot Designs for Consistent Frequency-Offset Estimation in OFDM Systems","sourcePdf":"55tcomm05-yli.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.069716S","chronDate":"May  2007","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"4200928","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"4200928","articleId":"4200965","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4200966,"authors":[{"name":"Yifei Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Arizona Tucson, Tucson, AZ, USA"],"firstName":"Yifei","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37558964300"},{"name":"William E.

In this paper, we investigate its combination with multi-input multi-output (MIMO) technology and propose two novel FDE-MIMO structures, which we refer to as FDE with noise prediction (FDE-NP) and FDE-NP with successive interference cancellation (FDE-NP-SIC). It is shown that the proposed schemes have lower complexity and achieve better performance and complexity tradeoff than the conventional FDE scheme with decision feedback processing. To evaluate the system performance, we will propose an accurate theoretical analysis based on the modified Chernoff bound (MCB) and show that it is not only applicable to the proposed FDE-NP and FDE-NP-SIC schemes, but also to general MIMO systems with equalization. By using the developed MCB along with simulation results, we will show that the proposed FDE-NP and FDE-NP-SIC schemes can achieve significant performance improvement over the conventional FDE MIMO schemes","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2007.895983","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/4200928/04200968.pdf","startPage":"1063","endPage":"1076","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2007.895983","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4200928","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Single-Carrier Frequency-Domain Equalization With Noise Prediction for MIMO Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4200968","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 May 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4200968/","displayDocTitle":"Single-Carrier Frequency-Domain Equalization With Noise Prediction for MIMO Systems","volume":"55","issue":"5","publicationDate":"May 2007","accessionNumber":"9457862","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4200968/","dateOfInsertion":"15 May 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Single-Carrier Frequency-Domain Equalization With Noise Prediction for MIMO Systems","sourcePdf":"55tcomm05-zhu.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.09911S","chronDate":"May  2007","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"4200928","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"27","xplore-issue":"4200928","articleId":"4200968","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4200981,"authors":[{"name":"Chung-Liang Chang","affiliation":["Institute of Science and Technology, Taoyuan, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/19/4200969/4200981/4200981-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Chung-Liang Chang received the B.S. degree in system engineering from Chung Cheng Institute of Technology, Taoyuan, Taiwan, R.O.C., in 1986, the M.S. degree in electrical engineering from Yuan-Ze College of Engineering, Taoyuan, in 1995, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from the National Defense University, Taoyuan, in 2007.","He is currently with Chung-Shan Institute of Science and Technology, Longtan, Taoyuan.

Previous studies have claimed that AWGN power is directly proportional to the jitter noise power. We demonstrate that the aperture jitter can influence the input signal of a sampling system but is independent of AWGN. The noise power, due to the aperture jitter in a frequency-nonselective slowly fading channel, is shown to be a function of the input signal, the aperture jitter, and the channel envelope. The frequency-selective slowly fading channel involves another parameter analyzable paths. The effect of the aperture jitter on the bit-error probability (BEP) of a binary-phase-shift-keying digital communication system is also considered. The received signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is calculated first, and its probability density function is derived. Then, the average BEP is evaluated as a function of SNR. Simulation results indicate that the aperture-jitter noise severely degrades the average BEP by reducing the received SNR.

Evaluation of these parameters is frequently performed using a discrete Fourier transform (DFT) algorithm. In practice, signals are mostly sampled noncoherently. This leads to the well-known effect called leakage, i.e., spreading energy of signal harmonic components into signal frequency neighboring frequency bins.

The designer has to select properly the guard interval and the number of carriers for a given system bandwidth to combat the channel dispersiveness. In this paper, we investigate the sensitivity of downlink multicarrier code-division multiple-access (MC-CDMA) performance to these parameters in different environments. We derive closed-form expressions of the useful and the different interference powers after maximum ratio combining and despreading. The optimum parameters correspond to the minimum of the signal-to-noise-ratio degradation. It turns out that the derivations in the paper of Steendam and Moeneclaey ( IEEE Trans. Commun., 1999) that are restricted to the orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) system are a particular case of our results. Numerical evaluation of the analytical expressions reveals that the optimum parameters of the MC-CDMA and its corresponding OFDM system are similar and depend in the same way on the channel characteristics. We show in this paper that the load of the MC-CDMA system only has small influence on the optimization of the parameters. Therefore, from the point of view of parameter optimization, single-user transmission is sufficient to find the optimum parameters.

The predistorter (PD) device consists of a lookup table (LUT) gain followed by a codebook of filters addressed by the index of the LUT. The adaptation is derived from direct learning for the LUT gains and indirect learning for the filter coefficients. We compared our results with those of two reference methods: a simple LUT system (with direct learning) and a memory polynomial system (with indirect learning). The performances of the new approach lie between those of the two reference methods in terms of adjacent channel power regrowth and error vector magnitude. The LUT is the less complex of the three methods, but it is a memoryless system, and it cannot correct the memory effects in the PA. The memory polynomial PD is more powerful, but its complexity is very high. The new technique, due to the addition of filters to the LUT, has possibilities to compensate not only for the nonlinearity but also for the memory effects in the PA, and it is one order of magnitude less complex than the memory polynomial system","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/4201028/04201045.pdf","startPage":"1076","endPage":"1087","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2007.895566","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2007.895566","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4201028","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4201045","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Filter Lookup Table Method for Power Amplifier Linearization","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Filters","Table lookup","Power amplifiers","Predistortion","Baseband","Linearity","Polynomials","Nonlinear distortion","Adaptive systems","Memoryless systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FIR filters","linearisation techniques","nonlinear distortion","power amplifiers","table lookup"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["lookup table method","power amplifier linearization","digital adaptive predistortion","predistorter device","codebook","filter coefficients","memory polynomial system","adjacent channel power regrowth","error vector magnitude"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Baseband predistortion","linearization","nonlinear distortions","power amplifier (PA)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4201045/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 May 2007","displayDocTitle":"Filter Lookup Table Method for Power Amplifier Linearization","volume":"56","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/4201045/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2007","accessionNumber":"9457787","dateOfInsertion":"15 May 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Filter Lookup Table Method for Power Amplifier Linearization","sourcePdf":"56tvt03-jardin.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.083924S","chronDate":"May  2007","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"4201028","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"69","xplore-issue":"4201028","articleId":"4201045","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4201046,"authors":[{"name":"Jia-Chin Lin","affiliation":["Department of Communication Engineering, National Central University, Jhongli, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/4201028/4201046/4201046-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jia-Chin Lin (S'95\u2013M'98\u2013SM'03) received the B.S. and M.S. degrees from the Department of Electronics Engineering, National Chiao-Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan, R.O.C., in 1994 and 1995, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree from National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan, in 1998.","He was in the obligatory military service from 1998 to 2000.

By taking advantage of subcarrier-level differential operation and coherent error characterization, the proposed estimator based on the frequency error characteristics can effectively overcome multipath fading effects. Frequency error characterization is achieved by means of pseudonoise matched filters in the frequency direction; thus, the proposed estimation technique exploits frequency diversity without assistance in the form of accurate timing information. In addition, the proposed technique can combat the rapid time selectivity caused by a wide Doppler spread because it requires channel stationarity for only a short duration due to the exploitation of both a single preamble in its training operation and the following semiblind estimation aided from several pilot subchannels. The proposed technique can easily switch between training mode and semiblind mode by sharing the same system architecture.

The simulation results also show that the proposed ST-CMOE detector can achieve the same performance as the training-based ST minimum-mean-square-error detector.

The computational load of this adaptive detector is comparable to Hu's method (IEEE Trans.

The high data rates provided by the MIMO system can be traded off with diversity gain by using different channel-coding schemes. Also, by using different video source-coding methods, high compression gain can be traded off with the error resilience gain. One should jointly consider source coding and channel coding when designing a MIMO wireless video system. However, little is known so far about what combinations of channel-coding and source-coding methods have the best overall performance in a MIMO system.

In this paper, we propose a frequency-domain ICI cancellation scheme, in which the residual ICI replica in the frequency domain is generated and subtracted from each frequency component of the received signal after FDE.

The WLPS consists of two main parts: 1) the detecting unit, a base station carried by a mobile unit defined as dynamic base station (DBS), and 2) the being detected unit, a transponder (TRX) that is mounted on the targets, each assigned a unique identification code. Each DBS should be capable of detecting and locating all available TRXs in its coverage area. As a result, the main complexity of this system is focused at the DBS receiver. In this paper, we introduce WLPS structure, and both theoretically and numerically compute, and compare the POD performance of the DBS receiver realized by a merger of DS-CDMA and antenna arrays. We also analyze and simulate the performance of this system under perturbations in the DBS antenna array vector.

In this paper, a novel stochastic wide-sense stationary sum-of-sinusoids channel simulator is proposed to emulate frequency-correlated wideband fading channels, where the frequency correlation properties are controlled by only adjusting the constant phases. Closed-form expressions are provided for all the parameters of the simulation model. This enables us to investigate analytically the overall correlation properties (not only the correlation coefficients) of the simulated processes with respect to both time separation and frequency separation. It is shown that the wideband channel simulator will be reduced to a narrowband Rayleigh fading-channel simulator by removing the frequency selectivity. Furthermore, the COST 207 typical-urban and rural-area channels are applied to evaluate the performance of the resulting wideband and narrowband channel simulators, respectively. The correlation properties of the simulation models approach the desired ones of the underlying reference models as the number of exponential functions tends to infinity, while very good approximations are achieved with the chosen limited number of exponential functions","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2007.895490","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/4201028/04201073.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2007.895490","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4201028","startPage":"1050","endPage":"1063","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Stochastic Modeling and Simulation of Frequency-Correlated Wideband Fading Channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4201073","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Stochastic Modeling and Simulation of Frequency-Correlated Wideband Fading Channels","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4201073/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 May 2007","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"56","issue":"3","publicationDate":"May 2007","accessionNumber":"9457785","dateOfInsertion":"15 May 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4201073/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Stochastic Modeling and Simulation of Frequency-Correlated Wideband Fading Channels","sourcePdf":"56tvt03-wang.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.108667S","chronDate":"May  2007","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"4201028","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"42","xplore-issue":"4201028","articleId":"4201073","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4201074,"authors":[{"name":"Guosen Yue","affiliation":["NEC Laboratories of America, Inc., Princeton, NJ, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/4201028/4201074/4201074-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Guosen Yue received the B.S. degree in physics and the M.S. degree in electrical engineering from Nanjing University, Nanjing, China, in 1994 and 1997, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree from Texas A&M University, College Station, in 2004.","Since August 2004, he has been with NEC Laboratories America, Princeton, NJ, conducting research on broadband wireless systems and mobile networks.

These subcarriers are assigned to different users for simultaneous transmission in orthogonal frequency-division multiple access (OFDMA). In an unsynchronized OFDMA uplink, each user has a different carrier frequency offset (CFO) relative to the common uplink receiver, which results in the loss of orthogonality among subcarriers and thereby multiple access interference. Hence, OFDMA is very sensitive to frequency synchronization errors. In this paper, we construct the received signals in frequency domain that would have been received if all users were frequency synchronized. A generalized OFDMA framework for arbitrary subcarrier assignments is proposed. The interference in the generalized OFDMA uplink due to frequency synchronization errors is characterized in a multiuser signal model. Least squares and minimum mean square error criteria are proposed to construct the orthogonal spectral signals from one OFDMA block contaminated with interference that was caused by the CFOs of multiple users. For OFDMA with a large number of subcarriers, a low-complexity implementation of the proposed algorithms is developed based on a banded matrix approximation. Numerical results illustrate that the proposed algorithms improve the system performance significantly and are computationally affordable using the banded system implementation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 May 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4201075/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2007","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"56","issue":"3","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May 2007","dateOfInsertion":"15 May 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4201075/","accessionNumber":"9457793","displayDocTitle":"Low-Complexity Orthogonal Spectral Signal Construction for Generalized OFDMA Uplink With Frequency Synchronization Errors","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low-Complexity Orthogonal Spectral Signal Construction for Generalized OFDMA Uplink With Frequency Synchronization Errors","sourcePdf":"56tvt03-zcao.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.079154S","chronDate":"May  2007","xplore-pub-id":"2007-25","isNumber":"4201028","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"106","xplore-issue":"4201028","articleId":"4201075","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4201098,"authors":[{"name":"Robert A.

Inordinate localized temperature rise, hottest spot temperature (HST), causes rapid thermal degradation of insulation and subsequent thermal breakdown. To prescribe the limits of short-term and long-term loading capability of a transformer, it is necessary to estimate the HST of transformer winding to as high a degree of accuracy as can possibly be made. These papers have now improved the accuracy of estimation of hottest spot temperature. Inordinate temperature rise in a power transformer due to load current is known to be the most important factor in causing rapid degradation of its insulation and decides the optimum load catering ability or the load ability of a transformer. The top oil temperature (TOT) and hottest spot temperature (HST) being natural outcome of this process, an accurate estimation of these parameters is of particular importance. IEEE / IEC among others have proposed procedure to estimate the temperatures, however, the accuracy of the predictions are not always as good as are desired. Unacceptable temperature rise may occur due to several fault conditions other than overloading, and hence warrant an online monitoring of the transformer.","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 International Conference on Thermal, Mechanical and Multi-Physics Simulation Experiments in Microelectronics and Micro-Systems.

The size distribution and the volume fraction percentage of the nanoparticles were determined as well as the variation of the mechanical properties of the pure epoxy resin compared to the composite material especially synthesized for this investigation. Then the diffusion coefficient of water in amorphous polymeric materials is measured (aromatic epoxy: 1,3-Bis-(2,3- epoxypropyl)-benzene and amine hardener: 1,2- Diaminoethan). Mechanical characterization of the materials, diffusion experiments (gravimetric), and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations examine the temperature range of 300-400 K, where diffusion coefficients will be calculated under thermodynamic boundary conditions by using a classical force-field MD. The diffusion mechanisms and the mechanical characterization are examined as a function of the stoichiometry and molecular weight of the polymers.","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 International Conference on Thermal, Mechanical and Multi-Physics Simulation Experiments in Microelectronics and Micro-Systems.

One of the major dissipation phenomena to consider in such high-Q micro-systems is thermoelastic damping. Hence, the performance of such MEMS is directly related to their thermoelastic quality factor which has to be predicted accurately. Analytical models have been developed in the literature to assess thermoelastic damping. However, these models are based on very restrictive assumptions and can only be used for simple configurations such as bending beams or bars in extension. In order to investigate structures of complex geometry, a numerical approach is required. In this paper, the finite element method is used to study the effect of the anchor on the thermoelastic quality factor of clamped-clamped silicon beams. Moreover, the effect of fillet at the anchor/beam interface is investigated. It is shown that smoothing the junction between the beam and the anchor can be benefic for some configurations while it can be detrimental in others. This study highlights the importance to have tied manufacturing tolerances for the purpose of high-Q micro-resonators fabrication.","doi":"10.1109/ESIME.2007.359939","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ESIME.2007.359939","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 International Conference on Thermal, Mechanical and Multi-Physics Simulation Experiments in Microelectronics and Micro-Systems.

PDMS is chosen as the membrane material for its elastic properties. A bimetallic energetic material composed of Mn and Co is chosen because of the high amount of biocompatible gas liberated from its decomposition. When the actuation is required, the energetic material is heated beyond the ignition temperature to generate a high concentration of gas; the gain in pressure produces the deformation of the elastic membrane. Individual models have been developed for each physical phenomenon: (i) the heating of the resistance by an electro-thermal model, (ii) the gas generation from the decomposition of the energetic material based on an ideal gas model and a mass transfer model and coupled with the elastic membrane deformation with a mechanical deformation model. This paper presents each individual model under COMSOL Multiphysics that has been correlated with experimental results. Then, the implementation of all models into one global model allow us to predict the actuator performance as a function of input electrical signal.","doi":"10.1109/ESIME.2007.359949","publicationTitle":"2007 International Conference on Thermal, Mechanical and Multi-Physics Simulation Experiments in Microelectronics and Micro-Systems.

Nevertheless, the PTT-based technique requires an individualized calibration procedure. In order to derive a simple procedure for estimating individualized coefficients for this approach, this paper aims to model PTT under the effects of hydrostatic pressure due to hand elevation. In this study, 11 volunteers were recruited. BP and PTT were measured while the subjects elevated their hands to specific heights above heart level (h). The results of the study show that PTT changes significantly with h (p<0.05) and the relationship between them generally agrees with that derives from the theoretical model. This suggests that using the proposed model, individualized coefficients for estimating BP by the PTT-based approach can be obtained from some simple movements such as hand elevation.","doi":"10.1109/ISSMDBS.2006.360098","publicationTitle":"2006 3rd IEEE/EMBS International Summer School on Medical Devices and Biosensors","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 3rd IEEE/EMBS International Summer School on Medical Devices and Biosensors","pdfPath":"/iel5/4201240/4201241/04201267.pdf","startPage":"65","endPage":"68","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISSMDBS.2006.360098","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4201241","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Modeling of Pulse Transit Time under the Effects of Hydrostatic Pressure for Cuffless Blood Pressure Measurements","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4201267","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-6 Sept. 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4201267/","displayDocTitle":"Modeling of Pulse Transit Time under the Effects of Hydrostatic Pressure for Cuffless Blood Pressure Measurements","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2006","accessionNumber":"9572266","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4201267/","conferenceDate":"4-6 Sept. 2006","dateOfInsertion":"15 May 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modeling of Pulse Transit Time under the Effects of Hydrostatic Pressure for Cuffless Blood Pressure Measurements","confLoc":"Cambridge, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"ISSMDBS-00-26.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.09093S","chronDate":"4-6 Sept. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4201240","isNumber":"4201241","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4201240","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"4201241","articleId":"4201267","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4201318,"authors":[{"name":"Min Gui","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering, Kansas State University, USA"],"firstName":"Min","lastName":"Gui","id":"37547055600"},{"name":"Anil Pahwa","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, Kansas State University, USA"],"firstName":"Anil","lastName":"Pahwa","id":"37282628600"},{"name":"Sanjoy Das","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, Kansas State University, USA"],"firstName":"Sanjoy","lastName":"Das","id":"37278510100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0227-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0228-X","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4201318","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":160},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4201318","abstract":"Occurrences of faults in overhead distribution systems are a significant factor in distribution system reliability. Prediction of animal-related failures has a practical value since animals cause large number of faults in overhead distribution systems. This paper presents a method to predict weekly animal-related failures in overhead distribution system using neural network and wavelet transform techniques. Discrete wavelet transform is applied to decompose the time series of weekly animal-related failures. Six different neural networks are constructed for each decomposed coefficient series. Finally, the output series of six neural networks are combined according to wavelet reconstruction techniques to get final output for the weekly animal-related failure prediction. Simulation results indicate that this combined method displays good performance.","doi":"10.1109/NAPS.2006.360147","startPage":"15","endPage":"22","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 38th North American Power Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/4201291/4201292/04201318.pdf","publicationTitle":"2006 38th North American Power Symposium","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NAPS.2006.360147","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4201292","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Prediction of Animal-Related Failures in Overhead Distribution Systems Using Neural Network and Wavelet Transform Techniques","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Wavelet transforms","Discrete wavelet transforms","Animals","Weather forecasting","Predictive models","Frequency","Power system reliability","Intelligent networks","Cities and towns"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["discrete wavelet transforms","neural nets","power distribution faults","power distribution reliability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["failure prediction","overhead distribution systems","neural networks","discrete wavelet transforms","wavelet reconstruction","power distribution reliability"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Animal-related failures","discrete wavelet transform","neural network","overhead distribution system"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4201318/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-19 Sept. 2006","displayDocTitle":"Prediction of Animal-Related Failures in Overhead Distribution Systems Using Neural Network and Wavelet Transform Techniques","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4201318/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2006","dateOfInsertion":"15 May 2007","conferenceDate":"17-19 Sept. 2006","accessionNumber":"10285306","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Prediction of Animal-Related Failures in Overhead Distribution Systems Using Neural Network and Wavelet Transform Techniques","confLoc":"Carbondale, IL, USA","sourcePdf":"NAPS-00-26.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049805S","chronDate":"17-19 Sept. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4201291","isNumber":"4201292","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4201291","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4201292","articleId":"4201318","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4201331,"authors":[{"name":"Damian Cieslicki","affiliation":["Department of Computer Engineering, Santa Clara University, Santa Clara, CA, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Damian Cieslicki is a Ph.

Neighboring independent system operators and regional transmission organizations also need to exchange system data. In the USA, a data exchange structure based on EPRI's common information model and XML is evolving. Currently, this data exchange is implemented by providing each local provider with an agent that mediates between data exchange messages and the local database. We propose here a different technology for data exchange built of main memory of commodity computers at different independent system operators to provide a universally accessible database. While distributed memory offers scalability and excellent access times (compared to disk based systems), it is also vulnerable to node outages. Our proposal, Highly Available Distributed RAM (HADRAM) is highly reliable and has the speed and bandwidth advantages of distributed memory. This enables it to be used as a standard for the timely exchange of system models and real time SCADA data between power utilities.","doi":"10.1109/NAPS.2006.359588","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NAPS.2006.359588","publicationTitle":"2006 38th North American Power Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 38th North American Power Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/4201291/4201292/04201331.pdf","startPage":"295","endPage":"302","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4201292","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4201331/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-19 Sept. 2006","displayDocTitle":"Highly Available Distributed RAM (HADRAM) for Data Exchange between Power Utilities","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"17-19 Sept. 2006","accessionNumber":"10288678","htmlLink":"/document/4201331/","dateOfInsertion":"15 May 2007","publicationDate":"Sept. 2006","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Highly Available Distributed RAM (HADRAM) for Data Exchange between Power Utilities","confLoc":"Carbondale, IL, USA","sourcePdf":"NAPS-00-39.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059454S","chronDate":"17-19 Sept. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4201291","isNumber":"4201292","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4201291","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4201292","articleId":"4201331","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4201341,"authors":[{"name":"Mevludin Glavic","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering and Computer Science Department, University of Li\u00e8ge, Liege, Belgium"],"firstName":"Mevludin","lastName":"Glavic","id":"37271725700"},{"name":"Damien Ernst","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering and Computer Science Department, University of Li\u00e8ge, Liege, Belgium"],"firstName":"Damien","lastName":"Ernst","id":"37281856000"},{"name":"Louis Wehenkel","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering and Computer Science Department, University of Li\u00e8ge, Liege, Belgium"],"firstName":"Louis","lastName":"Wehenkel","id":"37272491900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0227-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0228-X","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4201341","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":155},"abstract":"The main idea behind the concept, proposed in the paper, is the opportunity to make control systems with increased capabilities by synergetic fusion of the domain-specific knowledge and the methodologies from control theory and artificial intelligence.

The generator company objectives are to maximize their profit and to place proper bids in the market. In order to do this they need to determine the schedule and operating points based on the load and price forecasts. The traditional unit commitment problem aims at minimizing the cost of operation subject to fulfillment of demand. However in a deregulated environment the traditional unit commitment objective needs to be changed to maximization of profit with relaxation of the demand fulfillment constraint. This paper applies a genetic algorithm technique to price based unit commitment (PBUC) for GENCO with 3 generators and compares the solution with that obtained by dynamic programming. Proposed algorithm can be extended to 'n' number of generators.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-19 Sept. 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4201350/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10288692","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4201350/","publicationDate":"Sept. 2006","dateOfInsertion":"15 May 2007","conferenceDate":"17-19 Sept. 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A Genetic Algorithm Approach to Price-Based Unit Commitment","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Genetic Algorithm Approach to Price-Based Unit Commitment","confLoc":"Carbondale, IL, USA","sourcePdf":"NAPS-00-58.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065996S","chronDate":"17-19 Sept. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4201291","isNumber":"4201292","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4201291","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4201292","articleId":"4201350","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":4201358,"authors":[{"name":"C.

Moreover, technological advances in renewable (wind, solar) and other alternative energy DG (AEDG) sources, e.g. microturbines and fuel cells, coupled with environmental concerns over the use of conventional steam power plants have developed especial interest in their use. However, because of the non-dispatchable nature of renewable energy and slow nature of some alternative energy power generation sources, e.g. fuel cells, multi-source operation of these sources and/or their parallel operation with a storage device is necessary to make their operation more reliable. This paper discusses the need for multi-source operation of AEDGs. It reviews four different AEDG sources - wind, solar photovoltaic (PV), microturbine, and fuel cells - and discusses their multi- source operation for better power management and reliability.","doi":"10.1109/NAPS.2006.359625","publicationTitle":"2006 38th North American Power Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 38th North American Power Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/4201291/4201292/04201368.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NAPS.2006.359625","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4201292","startPage":"547","endPage":"551","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Alternative Energy Distributed Generation: Need for Multi-Source Operation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4201368","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Alternative Energy Distributed Generation: Need for Multi-Source Operation","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-19 Sept. 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4201368/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"17-19 Sept. 2006","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2006","accessionNumber":"10288708","dateOfInsertion":"15 May 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4201368/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Alternative Energy Distributed Generation: Need for Multi-Source Operation","confLoc":"Carbondale, IL, USA","sourcePdf":"NAPS-00-76.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.075266S","chronDate":"17-19 Sept. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4201291","isNumber":"4201292","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4201291","citationCount":"29","xplore-issue":"4201292","articleId":"4201368","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4201691,"authors":[{"name":"Herbert L.

In these systems, target position is obtained by trilateration using only range data collected by a group of v stations located in an arbitrary geometry. The method of maximum likelihood is used to obtain a joint estimator for the target coordinates which makes optimal use of the redundant data when the noise is Gaussian. A simple recursion formula for the estimator is obtained for this purpose and is shown to be convergent. This formula makes it possible to add data from a redundant number of stations at will and in proportion to their relative reliability. Further, it is shown that the recursion formula can be written entirely in terms of the changes in the successive iterative target position estimates. This technique offers a new means of obtaining tracking data on a moving target since it permits changes in target position to be computed directly as new data are obtained. The covariance matrix of the joint three-dimensional estimator is obtained in the case in which the measurement noise is small compared to the distances measured. The mean-square position error, namely, the trace of the covariance matrix, is shown to have a simple form for the general two-dimensional system in which the target and stations are coplanar.

The system analyzed is an amplitude comparison estimator. Off-axis targets are considered. The effects of narrow-band Gaussian receiver noise on the sum and difference signals are considered. An asymptotic expansion for the angle estimate is derived which converges for SNR's of 12 db or greater. The mean and the standard deviation of the angle estimate are found. These statistics are given in terms of antenna radiation patterns, true target angular position, SNR, and noise statistics. It is found that the expected value of off-boresight angle estimates is equal to the true angle of the target. Further, the standard deviation of the angle estimate increases as the target is moved off boresight. This increase is greater than would be expected from the decrease in antenna gain due to off-axis operation. Correlation between noise in the sum and difference channels reduces the off-axis errors.","doi":"10.1109/TANE3.1962.4201876","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TANE3.1962.4201876","startPage":"175","endPage":"179","displayPublicationTitle":"IRE Transactions on Aerospace and Navigational Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/5483689/4201865/04201876.pdf","publicationTitle":"IRE Transactions on Aerospace and Navigational Electronics","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4201865","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Angle Estimation Accuracy with a Monopulse Radar in the Search Mode","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  1962","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  1962","displayDocTitle":"Angle Estimation Accuracy with a Monopulse Radar in the Search Mode","publicationDate":"Sept. 1962","dateOfInsertion":"15 May 2009","volume":"ANE-9","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4201876/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Angle Estimation Accuracy with a Monopulse Radar in the Search Mode","sourcePdf":"TANE3-vANE-9-n3-11.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.020702S","chronDate":"Sept.  1962","isNumber":"4201865","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5483689","citationCount":"22","articleId":"4201876","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1962","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4201896,"authors":[{"name":"Ole K.

The scheduling strategy is required in order to decide which node will be used as a relay. The proposed schemes are the classical Round Robin, and a channel-based scheduling policy which requires a partial feedback from the channel. This scheme is implemented in a centralized and a distributed version. Simulations and analytical results show that the distributed algorithm outperforms the Round Robin and is 3 dB worse than the centralized algorithm, due to possible collisions or outage scheduling. This algorithm provides the best trade-off between performance and complexity and is attractive for practical implementations.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Relays","Round robin","Scheduling algorithm","Broadcasting","Feedback","Distributed algorithms","Bit error rate","Analytical models","Algorithm design and analysis","Wireless communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed algorithms","protocols","scheduling","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["scheduling strategy","amplify-and-forward relay environment","Round Robin","channel-based scheduling policy","partial feedback","distributed algorithm"]}],"doi":"10.1109/LCOMM.2007.070077","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","pdfPath":"/iel5/4234/4202074/04202091.pdf","startPage":"414","endPage":"416","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4202074","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LCOMM.2007.070077","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Three scheduling schemes for amplify-and-forward relay environments","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4202091","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Three scheduling schemes for amplify-and-forward relay environments","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4202091/","volume":"11","issue":"5","publicationDate":"May 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4202091/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"9478449","dateOfInsertion":"11 June 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 June 2007","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Three scheduling schemes for amplify-and-forward relay environments","sourcePdf":"cl_0705_414.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.034909S","chronDate":"May  2007","xplore-pub-id":"4234","isNumber":"4202074","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4234","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"4202074","articleId":"4202091","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":4202093,"authors":[{"name":"Marcus Grossmann","affiliation":["Institute of Information Technology, Technical University Ilmenau, Germany"],"firstName":"Marcus","lastName":"Grossmann","id":"37410512300"},{"name":"Tad Matsumoto","affiliation":["Center for Wireless Communications, University of Oulu, Finland"],"firstName":"Tad","lastName":"Matsumoto","id":"37277382600"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-7798"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2558"},{"format":"CD","value":"2373-7891"}],"articleNumber":"4202093","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":114},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multiuser detection","OFDM","Signal detection","Receiving antennas","Transmitting antennas","Covariance matrix","Interference cancellation","Filtering","Noise reduction","Noise cancellation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["correlation methods","interference suppression","least mean squares methods","maximum likelihood detection","multiuser detection","OFDM modulation","turbo codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hybrid turbo multiuser detection","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","OFDM transmission","soft interference canceling","minimum mean-square error","SC-MMSE filtering","maximum a posteriori signal detection","MAP","pairwise spatial channel correlation","interference suppression"]}],"abstract":"This letter proposes a novel hybrid turbo multi-user (MU) detection technique based on group-wise soft interference canceling minimum mean-square error filtering (SC-MMSE) combined with maximum a posteriori (MAP) signal detection for OFDM MU systems.

However it has been reported that the belief propagation (BP) decoding for these codes converges slower than for unpunctured codes. Layered BP algorithm is a modified BP algorithm that accelerates the decoding convergence by means of sequential scheduling of check node updates.

Although orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems are developed to cope with the frequency selectivity of the channel, they will suffer from interference caused by the time-varying character of the channel, present in particular in the LOS component, when the number of carriers increases. A proper selection of the system parameters, such as the number of carriers and the length of the cyclic prefix, can alleviate the effect of the doubly-selective channel on the system performance. In this paper, we investigate analytically the effect of the aforementioned system parameters on the performance, and determine the optimum values of the system parameters.

This paper proposes designing precoders by maximizing the so-called signal-to-leakage-and-noise ratio (SLNR) for all users simultaneously. The presentation considers communications with both single- and multi-stream cases, as well as MIMO systems that employ Alamouti coding.

In this paper, we explore the feasibility of a distributed beamforming approach to this problem, with a cluster of distributed transmitters emulating a centralized antenna array so as to transmit a common message signal coherently to a distant base station. The potential SNR gains from beamforming are well-known. However, realizing these gains requires synchronization of the individual carrier signals in phase and frequency. In this paper we show that a large fraction of the beamforming gains can be realised even with imperfect synchronization corresponding to phase errors with moderately large variance. We present a master-slave architecture where a designated master transmitter coordinates the synchronization of other (slave) transmitters for beamforming. We observe that the transmitters can achieve distributed beamforming with minimal coordination with the base station using channel reciprocity. Thus, inexpensive local coordination with a master transmitter makes the expensive communication with a distant base station receiver more efficient. However, the duplexing constraints of the wireless channel place a fundamental limitation on the achievable accuracy of synchronization. We present a stochastic analysis that demonstrates the robustness of beamforming gains with imperfect synchronization, and demonstrate a tradeoff between synchronization overhead and beamforming gains. We also present simulation results for the phase errors that validate the analysis","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2007.360377","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/4202153/04202181.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2007.360377","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4202153","startPage":"1754","endPage":"1763","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the Feasibility of Distributed Beamforming in Wireless Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4202181","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"On the Feasibility of Distributed Beamforming in Wireless Networks","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4202181/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 May 2007","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"6","issue":"5","publicationDate":"May 2007","accessionNumber":"9458067","dateOfInsertion":"21 May 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4202181/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the Feasibility of Distributed Beamforming in Wireless Networks","sourcePdf":"tw_0705_1754.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.06468S","chronDate":"May  2007","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"4202153","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"346","xplore-issue":"4202153","articleId":"4202181","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-19"},{"_id":4202182,"authors":[{"name":"Jinho Choi","affiliation":["Institute of Advanced Telecommunications (IAT), University of Wales, UK"],"bio":{"p":["Jinho Choi received B.E.

Our study for signalling includes the two well known digital (decode and forward) relaying, analogue (amplify and forward) relaying, and a novel hybrid (filter, amplify and forward) relaying. We propose both optimal and suboptimal hybrid relaying schemes which avoid full decoding of the message at the relay. We show that they outperform analogue relaying and give similar performance to digital relaying, particularly when the relay has forward channel state information (CSI) or larger number of antennas than the source and destination. For the routing schemes designed for multiple relay channels, we use relay selection schemes to exploit the spatial diversity, which we call selection diversity of the networks. We propose both optimal and suboptimal relay selection schemes and show that their performance converges when a large number of antennas is deployed at each node in the network. We also compare relay selection routing with a space-time coded relay cooperation protocol and show the performance advantage of selection diversity over cooperative diversity in certain scenarios. Finally, we give a brief discussion on the application of another MIMO structure called single signal beamforming in the relay scenario.

This superdirectivity leads to very large capacity bounds, particularly when the antennas are closely spaced. However, because superdirective behavior is difficult to achieve in practice, new capacity bounds have been formulated for the case where the level of array superdirectivity is constrained.

A new constellation extension technique is developed whereby the data for each subcarrier are represented either by points in the original constellation or by extended points. An optimal representation of the OFDM signal is achieved by using a de-randomization algorithm where the conditional probability involved is handled by using the Chernoff bound and the evaluation of the many hyperbolic cosine functions involved is replaced by a tight upper bound for these functions. The proposed algorithm can be used by itself or be combined with a selective rotation technique described in the paper and with other known algorithms such as the coordinate descent optimization and selective mapping algorithms to achieve further performance enhancements at the cost of a slight increase in the computational complexity.

For this reason, iterative soft decoding has been studied to approach the optimal ML decoding performance at affordable complexity. In multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) channels, a judicious decoding strategy consists of two stages: 1) estimate the soft bits using list version of sphere decoding or its variants, and 2) update the soft bits through iterative soft decoding. A promising MIMO decoder is required to produce reliable soft-bit estimates at the first stage before iterative soft decoding is performed. In this paper, we focus on the overloaded (or fat) MIMO antenna systems where the number of receive antennas is less than the number of signals multiplexed in the spatial domain. In this scenario, the original form of sphere decoding is inherently not applicable and our aim is to generalize sphere decoding geometrically to cope with overloaded detection. The so-called slab-sphere decoding (SSD) proposed guarantees to obtain exact-ML hard detection while reducing complexity greatly. With the list-version of SSD, (his paper proposes an efficient MIMO soft decoder, which can generate reliable soft-bit estimates at affordable complexity as inputs for iterative soft decoding for promising performance.

We provide the general mathematical formulation of the capacity maximization problem whose resource allocation includes user selection, power allocation and receive signal subspace selection. While the optimal solution of this problem is difficult to obtain, we consider two special cases: user selection based only and antenna selection based only optimization, and develop the optimal solution by reformulating the combinatorial optimization problem into a convex problem. Our proposed algorithms for these special cases can be extended to develop a suboptimal algorithm for the original general optimization problem which allows subspace selection. Moreover, we develop reduced-complexity algorithms for these problems which incur negligible capacity loss. Numerical results and analysis are provided to evaluate the system capacity and to study the effect of the number of users and the receive antennas per user on the performance.

We prove the (nonobvious) existence of such jointly concentrated pulse pairs by adapting recent mathematical results on Weyl-Heisenberg frames to the MC context. Furthermore, pulse optimization procedures are proposed that aim at low interference and capitalize on the design freedom existing for redundant MC systems.

Non-binary unity-rate precoders are employed for assisting the iterative decoding of the VL-STCM-ID scheme. The discrete-valued source symbols are first encoded into variable-length codewords that are mapped to the spatial and temporal domains. Then the variable-length codewords are interleaved and fed to the precoder assisted modulator. More explicitly, the proposed VL-STCM-ID arrangement is a jointly designed iteratively decoded scheme combining source coding, channel coding, modulation as well as spatial diversity/multiplexing. As expected, the higher the source correlation, the higher the achievable performance gain of the scheme becomes. Furthermore, the performance of the VL-STCM-ID scheme is about 14.6 dB better than that of the fixed length STCM (FL-STCM) benchmarker at a source symbol error ratio of 10\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">-4</sup>","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2007.360396","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/4202153/04202200.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2007.360396","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4202153","startPage":"1953","endPage":"1963","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Iteratively Decoded Variable Length Space-Time Coded Modulation: Code Construction and Convergence Analysis","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4202200","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Iteratively Decoded Variable Length Space-Time Coded Modulation: Code Construction and Convergence Analysis","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4202200/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 May 2007","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"6","issue":"5","publicationDate":"May 2007","accessionNumber":"9458086","dateOfInsertion":"21 May 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4202200/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Iteratively Decoded Variable Length Space-Time Coded Modulation: Code Construction and Convergence Analysis","sourcePdf":"tw_0705_1953.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.080841S","chronDate":"May  2007","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"4202153","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"4202153","articleId":"4202200","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4202202,"authors":[{"name":"Kai Li","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/4202153/4202202/4202202-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Kai Li received the B.S. degree in Electronics and Information Science from Peking University, Beijing, China, in 2000, and the M.

In IDMA, each user's chip sequence is interleaved by a distinct chip-level interleaver. The receiver employs a simple chip-level iterative multiuser detector to decode the user's data. Here we focus on the analysis and optimization of such an IDMA system. We show that IDMA can be viewed as a limit case of the conventional CDMA employing repetition code and random spreading. Two analytical tools, namely, the large-system performance approximation and the EXIT chart technique are tailored in the context of IDMA chip-level iterative detector to facilitate the system performance analysis and optimization. The spectral efficiencies of a low-rate coded IDMA system with equal power setting in both single-cell and multi-cell scenarios are then analyzed, from which it is seen that the coded IDMA system with turbo receiver is a spectral efficient multiple-access scheme. Finally, we consider optimal power allocation among users in IDMA to maximize the spectral efficiency with finite-alphabet constellation. The differential evolution technique for nonlinear optimization is adopted to solve the power profile optimization problem. With optimized power profiles, the low-rate coded IDMA system can approach the optimal spectral efficiency with finite input constellations","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/4202153/04202202.pdf","startPage":"1973","endPage":"1983","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2007.360398","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2007.360398","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4202153","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4202202","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis and Optimization of Interleave-Division Multiple-Access Communication Systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Detectors","Performance analysis","Multiaccess communication","Spread spectrum communication","Interleaved codes","Multiuser detection","Bit error rate","Performance gain","Iterative decoding","System performance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiple access","iterative methods","multiuser detection","spread spectrum communication","turbo codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiple-access communication systems","interleave-division multiple-access system","flexible spread-spectrum air-interface technique","chip sequence","distinct chip-level interleaver","chip-level iterative multiuser detector","CDMA","random spreading","EXIT chart technique","chip-level iterative detector","single-cell scenarios","multi-cell scenarios","turbo receiver","optimal power allocation","nonlinear optimization"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4202202/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 May 2007","displayDocTitle":"Analysis and Optimization of Interleave-Division Multiple-Access Communication Systems","volume":"6","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/4202202/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2007","accessionNumber":"9458088","dateOfInsertion":"21 May 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis and Optimization of Interleave-Division Multiple-Access Communication Systems","sourcePdf":"tw_0705_1973.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.068291S","chronDate":"May  2007","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"4202153","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"4202153","articleId":"4202202","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4202207,"authors":[{"name":"R.

In addition, this paper analyzes whether or not such an option is truly best by comparing it to the case where the wind farm can purchase call/put options to protect against the uncertainty of the wind. To determine the proper price of these options, the Black-Scholes options pricing model is used to ensure there is no ability to arbitrage, i.e. there is no free lunch. This second option will also consider the pumped storage plant's financial gain when working independent as well in order to make a fair comparison.

The project focus on prediction horizons up to 48 hours ahead and investigates predictability of wind for higher horizons up to 7 days ahead useful i.e. for maintenance scheduling. Emphasis is given on the integration of high-resolution meteorological forecasts. Specific modules are also developed for on-line uncertainty and prediction risk estimation. An integrated software platform, 'ANEMOS', is developed to host the various models. This system is installed by several end-users for on-line operation at onshore and offshore wind farms for prediction at a local, regional and national scale.

However, the additional simplicity means that the method has to separate two complex subspaces by one hyperplane thus affecting the recognition accuracy. In order to improve the recognition performance, we develop three more Bayesian-based SVMs, including the one-versus-all method, the hierarchical agglomerative clustering-based method, and the adaptive clustering method. Finally, we combine the adaptive clustering method with multilevel subspace analysis to further improve the recognition performance.

A more serious limitation of the original QIM algorithm is its sensitivity to valumetric changes (e.g., changes in amplitude). In this paper, we first propose using Watson's perceptual model to adaptively select the quantization step size based on the calculated perceptual \"slack\". Experimental results on 1000 images indicate improvements in fidelity as well as improved robustness in high-noise regimes. Watson's perceptual model is then modified such that the slacks scale linearly with valumetric scaling, thereby providing a QIM algorithm that is theoretically invariant to valumetric scaling.

This paper investigates the security issues in cooperative communications under the context of multiple relay nodes using decode-and-forward strategy, where one of the relay nodes is adversarial and tries to corrupt the communications by sending garbled signals. We show that the conventional physical-layer signal detector will lead to a high error rate in signal detection in such a scenario, and the application-layer cryptography alone will not be able to distinguish the adversarial relay from legitimate ones.

For this, we model wireless stations (WSTAs) as rational and selfish players competing for available wireless resources in a dynamic game. We focus on polling-based wireless LAN (WLAN) networks, where developing an efficient solution for managing the available transmission opportunities is of paramount importance. The resource allocation game is coordinated by a network moderator, which deploys a novel resource management based on the Vickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG) mechanism to determine a) the amount of time to be allocated to the various users and b) the transmission cost associated to the allocated resources. The transmission cost is referred to in the VCG mechanism as \"transfer\" and depends not on the used resources, but rather on the inconvenience (in terms of utility impact) that it causes to other WSTAs. The transfer is introduced in order to discourage WSTAs from lying about their resource requirements. Importantly, this proposed dynamic resource management approach for wireless multimedia applications changes the passive way stations are currently adapting their cross-layer strategies by enabling them to selfishly influence the wireless systems dynamics by proactively adapting their packet scheduling strategies, error protection strategies, etc. Hence, each wireless station can play the resource management game by adapting its multimedia transmission strategy depending on the experienced channel conditions, derived video quality, attitude towards risk, willingness to pay for resources and available information about the wireless network. Our simulations show that using the VCG mechanism the WSTAs do not have any incentives to lie about their resource requirements as otherwise they will be severely penalized by a high transfer. We also show that deploying advanced cross-layer strategies for playing the resource management game significantly benefit the WSTAs' received video quality. The willingness-to-pay for resources is introduced to provide WSTAs a tool to gather additional resources whenever they need to transmit an important (part of a) video sequence by agreeing to pay for resources an increased cost. A novel risk-aware scheduling scheme is also proposed that provides WSTAs the ability to dynamically avoid network congestion and hence, reduce their incurred transfer","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Multimedia","pdfPath":"/iel5/6046/4202580/04202589.pdf","startPage":"851","endPage":"868","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Multimedia","doi":"10.1109/TMM.2007.895676","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMM.2007.895676","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4202580","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4202589","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Noncollaborative Resource Management for Wireless Multimedia Applications Using Mechanism Design","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Resource management","Costs","Multimedia systems","Wireless LAN","Games","Wireless communication","Multimedia communication","Scheduling algorithm","Protection","Wireless networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["game theory","image sequences","media streaming","resource allocation","video communication","wireless LAN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["noncollaborative dynamic resource management game","wireless multimedia communication system","polling-based wireless LAN network","resource allocation game","Vickrey-Clarke-Groves mechanism","packet scheduling strategy","error protection strategy","video quality","video sequence","risk-aware scheduling scheme","multiuser wireless transmission","wireless multimedia streaming"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cross-layer optimization","game theory","mechanism design","multiuser wireless transmission","resource management","wireless multimedia streaming"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4202589/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 May 2007","displayDocTitle":"Noncollaborative Resource Management for Wireless Multimedia Applications Using Mechanism Design","volume":"9","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/4202589/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"9468568","dateOfInsertion":"21 May 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Noncollaborative Resource Management for Wireless Multimedia Applications Using Mechanism Design","sourcePdf":"09tmm04-fu.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.159963S","chronDate":"June  2007","xplore-pub-id":"6046","isNumber":"4202580","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6046","citationCount":"32","xplore-issue":"4202580","articleId":"4202589","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4202607,"authors":[{"name":"Hanli Wang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, City University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Hanli","lastName":"Wang","id":"37292564900"},{"name":"Sam Kwong","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, City University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Sam","lastName":"Kwong","id":"37266290800"},{"name":"Chi-Wah Kok","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, City University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Chi-Wah","lastName":"Kok","id":"37275220300"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1520-9210"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0077"}],"articleNumber":"4202607","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":74,"citationCountPatent":4,"totalDownloads":611},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.ieee.org/organizations/society/sp/index.html"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computer Society","url":"http://www.computer.org/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Circuits &amp;

In case of impulsive noise, this estimate is no more appropriate. This is the reason why when the noise is modeled by spherically invariant random vectors (SIRV), a natural extension of the SCM is extensively used in the literature: the well-known normalized sample covariance matrix (NSCM), which estimates the covariance of SIRV. Indeed, this estimate gets rid of a fluctuating noise power and is widely used in radar applications. The aim of this paper is to derive closed-form expressions of the first- and second-order moments of the NSCM","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Covariance matrix","Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","Performance analysis","Matrix decomposition","Radar applications","Closed-form solution","Maximum likelihood estimation","Clutter","Fading","Sonar"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["covariance matrices","Gaussian processes","impulse noise","radar signal processing","signal sampling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["first-order moments","second-order moments","normalized sample covariance matrix","NSCM","spherically invariant random vectors","SIRV","Gaussian assumption","impulsive noise","radar application","closed-form expression"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Estimation","normalized sample covariance matrix (NSCM)","performance analysis","spherically invariant random vectors (SIRV)"]}],"doi":"10.1109/LSP.2006.888400","publicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Letters","pdfPath":"/iel5/97/4202610/04202611.pdf","startPage":"425","endPage":"428","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4202610","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LSP.2006.888400","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"First- and Second-Order Moments of the Normalized Sample Covariance Matrix of Spherically Invariant Random Vectors","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4202611","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"First- and Second-Order Moments of the Normalized Sample Covariance Matrix of Spherically Invariant Random Vectors","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4202611/","volume":"14","issue":"6","publicationDate":"June 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4202611/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"9466180","dateOfInsertion":"21 May 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 May 2007","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"First- and Second-Order Moments of the Normalized Sample Covariance Matrix of Spherically Invariant Random Vectors","sourcePdf":"14lsp06-bausson.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.068069S","chronDate":"June  2007","xplore-pub-id":"97","isNumber":"4202610","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"97","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"4202610","articleId":"4202611","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4202614,"authors":[{"name":"YoungBo Cho","affiliation":["Center for Information Technology, Information and Telecommunication Laboratory, Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Yonsei University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"YoungBo","lastName":"Cho","id":"37334993000"},{"name":"Sangmin Ro","affiliation":["Center for Information Technology, Information and Telecommunication Laboratory, Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Yonsei University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Sangmin","lastName":"Ro","id":"37339484500"},{"name":"Daesik Hong","affiliation":["Center for Information Technology, Information and Telecommunication Laboratory, Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Yonsei University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Daesik","lastName":"Hong","id":"37274629700"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1070-9908"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2361"}],"articleNumber":"4202614","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":90},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.signalprocessingsociety.org"}],"abstract":"We propose a new channel-estimation method in a multicarrier-code division multiple access system with chip interleaving.

A 2-bit times 4-bit optical TTD for 10-GHz 2-D PAAs has been implemented by cascading a wavelength-dependent TTD (WD-TTD) with a unit time delay of 12 ps in the x-direction and a wavelength-independent TTD (WI-TTD) with that of 6 ps in the y-direction. The time delay error for WD-TTD was measured to be less than 2.8 ps, mainly due to jitter incurred from gain-switching. On the other hand, the error for WI-TTD was less than 0.8 ps, which is within the equipment resolution.

However, the larger the size of yoke that covers the magnetic field is, the better uniformity it will perform. This study, therefore, is dedicated to conduct an optimal design with the coupled relationship between magnetic field and mechanical geometry.

These oppositely biasing fields shift the write field switching window of the two cells in opposite directions along the anisotropy axis and enable the dual-bit cells to be selectively toggled. The calculated write switching current margins for the multibit cell with respect to the design and material parameters are included. The write current margin is found to be similar to the single biased low write current MRAM case. This oppositely bias scheme can be combined with the earlier multibit cell of distinct anisotropy axes approach to further enhance the density of the MRAM. This new scheme doubles the multicell bit capacity and reduces the power consumption without adding the photo-patterning steps","doi":"10.1109/TMAG.2007.893521","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/20/4202640/04202787.pdf","startPage":"2340","endPage":"2342","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMAG.2007.893521","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4202640","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Oppositely Biased Multibit Cells for Toggle Magnetic Random Access Memory","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 May 2007","displayDocTitle":"Oppositely Biased Multibit Cells for Toggle Magnetic Random Access Memory","volume":"43","issue":"6","dateOfInsertion":"21 May 2007","accessionNumber":"9479484","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"June 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4202787/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4202787/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2007","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Oppositely Biased Multibit Cells for Toggle Magnetic Random Access Memory","sourcePdf":"43tmag06-ju.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.024043S","chronDate":"June  2007","xplore-pub-id":"20","isNumber":"4202640","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"20","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4202640","articleId":"4202787","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4202805,"authors":[{"name":"Ki-Chan Kim","affiliation":["Energy Conversion Laboratory, Department of Electrical Engineering, Hanyang University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Ki-Chan","lastName":"Kim","id":"37292682000"},{"name":"Dae-Hyun Koo","affiliation":["Mechatronics Research Group, KERI, Industry Applications Research Laboratory, Changwon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Dae-Hyun","lastName":"Koo","id":"37289276900"},{"name":"Jung-Pyo Hong","affiliation":["Department of Automotive Engineering, Hanyang University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Jung-Pyo","lastName":"Hong","id":"37289921800"},{"name":"Ju Lee","affiliation":["Energy Conversion Laboratory, Department of Electrical Engineering, Hanyang University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Ju","lastName":"Lee","id":"37280315000"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9464"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0069"}],"articleNumber":"4202805","dbTime":"14 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":52,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1648},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Magnetics Society","url":"http://www.ieeemagnetics.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Torque","Hybrid electric vehicles","Ducts","Magnetic analysis","Demagnetization","Magnetic flux","Permanent magnet motors","Laboratories","Forging","Traction motors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electric potential","finite element analysis","permanent magnet motors","rotors","synchronous motors","torque"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["pole arc","pole pitch","torque ripple","IPMSM","interior permanent magnet motor","saliency parameter","duct structure","cogging torque","back EMF","finite element method","FEM","demagnetization effect"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["IPMSM","pole-arc to pole-pitch ratio","salient pole ratio","torque ripple"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, the design methodology of a rotor for the interior permanent magnet motor (IPMSM) considering pole-arc to pole-pitch ratio and saliency parameter owing to PM and duct structure is proposed in order to improve the characteristics such as average torque, torque ripple, cogging torque and back EMF waveform.

The key of the proposed machine is to incorporate both direct current (dc) field windings and permanent magnets (PMs) in the stator, hence, offering a compact arrangement of hybrid field excitations, while the rotor is simply composed of salient poles without windings or PMs. The air-gap flux can be strengthened or weakened with a reasonable dc field current so that the electromagnetic torque and induced electromotive force (EMF) can be effectively regulated. To predict the electromagnetic performances of the machine more accurately, a new transient cosimulation approach considering indirect field-circuit coupling is proposed. Experimental results on a prototype machine have been given to verify the technique. The method is not only more efficient and flexible, but also more accurate and stable, which can also be used in analyzing other electric machine and drive systems","doi":"10.1109/TMAG.2007.893318","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/20/4202640/04202972.pdf","startPage":"2558","endPage":"2560","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMAG.2007.893318","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4202640","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Transient Cosimulation Approach to Performance Analysis of Hybrid Excited Doubly Salient Machine Considering Indirect Field-Circuit Coupling","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4202972","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 May 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4202972/","displayDocTitle":"A Transient Cosimulation Approach to Performance Analysis of Hybrid Excited Doubly Salient Machine Considering Indirect Field-Circuit Coupling","volume":"43","issue":"6","publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"9491746","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4202972/","dateOfInsertion":"21 May 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Transient Cosimulation Approach to Performance Analysis of Hybrid Excited Doubly Salient Machine Considering Indirect Field-Circuit Coupling","sourcePdf":"43tmag06-xzhu2.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.036308S","chronDate":"June  2007","xplore-pub-id":"20","isNumber":"4202640","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"20","citationCount":"88","xplore-issue":"4202640","articleId":"4202972","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4202975,"authors":[{"name":"Ming Yan","affiliation":["Pulse Magnetic Field Laboratory, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Ming","lastName":"Yan","id":"37686131100"},{"name":"K.

Those afflicted suffer illusory visual field movement during head movements, chronic disequilibrium and postural instability due to failure of vestibulo-ocular and vestibulo-spinal reflexes. A neural prosthesis that emulates the normal transduction of head rotation by semicircular canals could significantly improve quality of life for these patients. Like the three semicircular canals in a normal ear, such a device should at least transduce three orthogonal (or linearly separable) components of head rotation into activity on corresponding ampullary branches of the vestibular nerve. We describe the design, circuit performance and in vivo application of a head-mounted, semi-implantable multichannel vestibular prosthesis that encodes head movement in three dimensions as pulse-frequency-modulated electrical stimulation of three or more ampullary nerves. In chinchillas treated with intratympanic gentamicin to ablate vestibular sensation bilaterally, prosthetic stimuli elicited a partly compensatory angular vestibulo-ocular reflex in multiple planes. Minimizing misalignment between the axis of eye and head rotation, apparently caused by current spread beyond each electrode's targeted nerve branch, emerged as a key challenge. Increasing stimulation selectivity via improvements in electrode design, surgical technique and stimulus protocol will likely be required to restore AVOR function over the full range of normal behavior","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4202999","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TBME.2007.894629","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/10/4202999/04203012.pdf","startPage":"1016","endPage":"1030","doi":"10.1109/TBME.2007.894629","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Multichannel Semicircular Canal Neural Prosthesis Using Electrical Stimulation to Restore 3-D Vestibular Sensation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2007","displayDocTitle":"A Multichannel Semicircular Canal Neural Prosthesis Using Electrical Stimulation to Restore 3-D Vestibular Sensation","volume":"54","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/4203012/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"9469230","dateOfInsertion":"21 May 2007","pubMedId":"17554821","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4203012/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 May 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Multichannel Semicircular Canal Neural Prosthesis Using Electrical Stimulation to Restore 3-D Vestibular Sensation","sourcePdf":"54tbme06-dellasantina-pt1.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.182457S","chronDate":"June  2007","xplore-pub-id":"10","isNumber":"4202999","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"108","xplore-issue":"4202999","articleId":"4203012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4203016,"authors":[{"name":"Zhonglin Lin","affiliation":["Department of Automation, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Zhonglin","lastName":"Lin","id":"37420894400"},{"name":"Changshui Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Automation, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Changshui","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37274216800"},{"name":"Wei Wu","affiliation":["Department of Biomedical Engineering, School of Medicine, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Wu","id":"37336723900"},{"name":"Xiaorong Gao","affiliation":["Department of Biomedical Engineering, School of Medicine, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Xiaorong","lastName":"Gao","id":"37277462900"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9294"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2531"}],"articleNumber":"4203016","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":271,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":2641},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society","url":"http://www.embs.org"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4203016","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Frequency","Electroencephalography","Spectral analysis","Signal analysis","Steady-state","Brain computer interfaces","Information analysis","Automation","Discrete Fourier transforms","Signal to noise ratio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bioelectric potentials","electroencephalography","handicapped aids","medical signal processing","statistical analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["frequency recognition","canonical correlation analysis","SSVEP-Based BCI","steady-state visual evoked potentials","electroencephalogram","fast Fourier transform"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Brain computer interface","canonical correlation analysis","electroencephalogram","steady-state visual evoked potentials"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Algorithms","Electroencephalography","Evoked Potentials, Visual","Fourier Analysis","Imagination","Pattern Recognition, Automated","Photic Stimulation","Reproducibility of Results","Sensitivity and Specificity","Statistics as Topic","User-Computer Interface","Visual Cortex","Visual Perception"]}],"abstract":"Canonical correlation analysis (CCA) is applied to analyze the frequency components of steady-state visual evoked potentials (SSVEP) in electroencephalogram (EEG).

We show that parallel resistance and capacitance is better than a series combination for use at all frequencies, and that with a tripole that was intentionally made imbalanced, by an amount that we measure as 3%, the interference can be reduced about 10-fold.

The receiver part was realized with four photodiodes connected in series. A parylene C coating was deposited on the electronic components as insulation layer. Silicone rubber was used to encapsulate the electronics in the shape of an artificial intraocular lens to allow proper implantation in the eye.

The hippocampus has long been known to be responsible for the formation of declarative, or fact-based, memories. Damage to the hippocampus disrupts the propagation of spatio-temporal patterns of activity through hippocampal internal circuitry, resulting in a severe anterograde amnesia. Developing a neural prosthesis for the damaged hippocampus requires restoring this multiple-input, multiple-output transformation of spatio-temporal patterns of activity. Because the mechanisms underlying synaptic transmission and generation of electrical activity in neurons are inherently nonlinear, any such prosthesis must be based on a nonlinear multiple-input, multiple-output model. In this paper, we have formulated the transformational process of multi-site propagation of spike activity between two subregions of the hippocampus (CA3 and CA1) as the identification of a multiple-input, multiple-output (MIMO) system, and proposed that it can be decomposed into a series of multiple-input, single-output (MISO) systems. Each MISO system is modeled as a physiologically plausible structure that consists of 1) linear/nonlinear feedforward Volterra kernels modeling synaptic transmission and dendritic integration, 2) a linear feedback Volterra kernel modeling spike-triggered after-potentials, 3) a threshold for spike generation, 4) a summation process for somatic integration, and 5) a noise term representing intrinsic neuronal noise and the contributions of unobserved inputs. Input and output spike trains were recorded from hippocampal CA3 and CA1 regions of rats performing a spatial delayed-nonmatch-to-sample memory task that requires normal hippocampal function. Kernels were expanded with Laguerre basis functions and estimated using a maximum-likelihood method. Complexity of the feedforward kernel was progressively increased to capture higher-order system nonlinear dynamics. Results showed higher prediction accuracies as kernel complexity increased. Self-kernels describe the nonlinearities within each input. Cross-kernels capture the nonlinear interaction between inputs. Secondand third-order nonlinear models were found to successfully predict the CA1 output spike distribution based on CA3 input spike trains. First-order, linear models were shown to be insufficient","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/10/4202999/04203029.pdf","startPage":"1053","endPage":"1066","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","doi":"10.1109/TBME.2007.891948","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TBME.2007.891948","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4202999","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4203029","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Nonlinear Dynamic Modeling of Spike Train Transformations for Hippocampal-Cortical Prostheses","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Prosthetics","Hippocampus","Kernel","Neurons","Neurotransmitters","Noise generators","Electrophysiology","Circuits","Neural prosthesis","MIMO"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bioelectric potentials","brain","neurophysiology","noise","prosthetics","spatiotemporal phenomena","stochastic processes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["nonlinear dynamic modeling","spike train transformation","hippocampal-cortical prostheses","cortical brain regions","hippocampus","neurons","neural firing","spatiotemporal patterns","electrophysiology","hippocampal internal circuitry","anterograde amnesia","synaptic transmission","multiple-input multiple-output system","multiple-input single-output system","feedforward Volterra kernels","spike-triggered after-potentials","dendritic integration","somatic integration","neuronal noise","spatial delayed-nonmatch-to-sample memory task","Laguerre basis functions","maximum-likelihood method","kernel complexity","CA3 input spike trains"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Feedback","hippocampus","Laguerre expansion","multiple-input","multiple-output system","spatio-temporal pattern","spike","time-rescaling theorem","Volterra kernel"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Action Potentials","Animals","Cerebral Cortex","Cognition Disorders","Cognition Disorders","Computer Simulation","Deep Brain Stimulation","Deep Brain Stimulation","Electric Stimulation","Electric Stimulation","Hippocampus","Humans","Models, Neurological","Nerve Net","Neural Pathways","Neurons","Nonlinear Dynamics","Prosthesis Design"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4203029/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 May 2007","displayDocTitle":"Nonlinear Dynamic Modeling of Spike Train Transformations for Hippocampal-Cortical Prostheses","volume":"54","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/4203029/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"9469233","pubMedId":"17554824","dateOfInsertion":"21 May 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Nonlinear Dynamic Modeling of Spike Train Transformations for Hippocampal-Cortical Prostheses","sourcePdf":"54tbme06-song-pt1.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.16068S","chronDate":"June  2007","xplore-pub-id":"10","isNumber":"4202999","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"145","xplore-issue":"4202999","articleId":"4203029","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4203036,"authors":[{"name":"Pradeep Aggarwal","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Pradeep","lastName":"Aggarwal","id":"37296337700"},{"name":"Narayan Prasad","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Narayan","lastName":"Prasad","id":"37284625900"},{"name":"Xiaodong Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Xiaodong","lastName":"Wang","id":"37281375000"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1053-587X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0476"}],"articleNumber":"4203036","dbTime":"17 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":12,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":311},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.signalprocessingsociety.org"}],"abstract":"We propose a low-complexity, linear minimum mean squared error (MMSE)-based sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) technique as an alternative to the sphere decoder for near-optimal demodulation in multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. Prior to the SMC procedure, the received signal is passed through a linear MMSE-based preprocessing step, which also determines an optimal channel-dependent order of detection and produces a sequential structure. The algorithm then draws the symbol samples in a deterministic fashion, and the survivor paths are selected based on their importance weights. The proposed algorithm exploits the rectangular structure of the QAM signal constellation by separating the real and imaginary parts of the signal to reduce the complexity associated with the listing and weight update steps, resulting in a complexity (in terms of the constellation size M) of O(radicM) as compared to O(M) complexity of the existing SMC algorithms for an M-QAM constellation. We demonstrate through simulations that the new method achieves the sphere decoder performance for V-BLAST systems. Unlike the sphere decoder whose complexity is channel-dependent, our algorithm has a fixed complexity which is channel independent; thus it is well suited for use in practical MIMO systems. Some other interesting features of the algorithm are that it is able to handle MIMO systems with less receive antennas than transmit antennas; and can also deal with multiuser multirate MIMO systems, utilizing a novel ordering scheme. Finally we extend the proposed algorithm to solve the lattice decoding problem and demonstrate the effect of different preprocessing stages on the performance and complexity of the algorithm through extensive simulation results","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/4203035/04203036.pdf","startPage":"2395","endPage":"2406","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2007.893201","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2007.893201","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4203035","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4203036","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Enhanced Deterministic Sequential Monte Carlo Method for Near-Optimal MIMO Demodulation With QAM Constellations","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Demodulation","Quadrature amplitude modulation","Decoding","Sliding mode control","Constellation diagram","Receiving antennas","Monte Carlo methods","Transmitting antennas","Lattices"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","decoding","demodulation","least mean squares methods","MIMO communication","Monte Carlo methods","quadrature amplitude modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["enhanced deterministic sequential Monte Carlo method","near-optimal MIMO demodulation","QAM constellations","linear minimum mean squared error","MMSE","multiple-input multiple-output systems","sphere decoder","V-BLAST systems","receive antennas","transmit antennas","multiuser multirate MIMO systems","lattice decoding problem"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Closest lattice point search","lattice decoding","linear minimum mean squared error (MMSE) processing","multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)","sequential Monte Carlo","soft-input soft-output","sphere decoder"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4203036/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 May 2007","displayDocTitle":"An Enhanced Deterministic Sequential Monte Carlo Method for Near-Optimal MIMO Demodulation With QAM Constellations","volume":"55","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"9472258","dateOfInsertion":"21 May 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Enhanced Deterministic Sequential Monte Carlo Method for Near-Optimal MIMO Demodulation With QAM Constellations","sourcePdf":"55tsp06-aggarwal-pt1.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.051445S","chronDate":"June  2007","isNumber":"4203035","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"12","articleId":"4203036","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4203038,"authors":[{"name":"Enrique Alameda-Hernandez","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University of Leeds, Leeds, UK"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/4203035/4203038/4203038-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Enrique Alameda-Hernandez was born in Granada, Spain, in 1975.

Recent enhancements of ST are data-dependent ST (DDST), where an additional data-dependent training sequence is also added to the information-bearing signal, and semiblind approaches based on ST. In this paper, along with the channel estimation, we consider new algorithms for training sequence synchronization for both ST and DDST and block (or frame) synchronization (BS) for DDST (BS is not needed for ST). The synchronization algorithms are based on the structural properties of the vector containing the cyclic means of the channel output. In addition, we also consider removal of the unknown dc offset that can occur due to using first-order statistics with a non-ideal radio-frequency receiver. The subsequent bit error rate (BER) simulations (after equalization) show a performance not far removed from the ideal case of exact synchronization. While this is the first synchronization algorithm for DDST, our new approach for ST gives identical results to an existing ST synchronization method but with a reduced computational burden. In addition, we also present analysis of BER simulations for time-varying channels, different modulation schemes, and traditional time-division multiplexed training. Finally, the advantage of DDST over (conventional, non semi-blind) ST will reduce as the constellation size increases, and we also show that even without a BS algorithm, DDST is still superior to conventional ST. However, iterative semiblind schemes based upon ST outperform DDST but at the expense of greater complexity","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/4203035/04203038.pdf","startPage":"2557","endPage":"2569","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4203035","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2007.893911","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2007.893911","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4203038","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Channel estimation","Statistics","Radio frequency","Bit error rate","Computational modeling","Bandwidth","Analytical models","Time-varying channels","Iterative algorithms","Cities and towns"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","error statistics","modulation","statistical analysis","synchronisation","time division multiplexing","time-varying channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["frame-training sequence synchronization","DC-offset removal","superimposed training based channel estimation","information-bearing data","time-division multiplexed","data-dependent training sequence","information-bearing signal","training sequence synchronization","first-order statistics","non-ideal radio-frequency receiver","subsequent bit error rate","BER","time-varying channels","different modulation schemes"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Block synchronization","dc-offset removal","implicit training","superimposed training channel estimation","training sequence synchronization"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4203038/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 May 2007","displayDocTitle":"Frame/Training Sequence Synchronization and DC-Offset Removal for (Data-Dependent) Superimposed Training Based Channel Estimation","accessionNumber":"9472272","dateOfInsertion":"21 May 2007","publicationDate":"June 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4203038/","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"55","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Frame/Training Sequence Synchronization and DC-Offset Removal for (Data-Dependent) Superimposed Training Based Channel Estimation","sourcePdf":"55tsp06-alamedahernandez-pt1.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.076446S","chronDate":"June  2007","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"4203035","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"31","xplore-issue":"4203035","articleId":"4203038","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":4203039,"authors":[{"name":"Francesco Bandiera","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Ingegneria dellInnovazione, Universit\u00e0 del Salento, Lecce, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/4203035/4203039/4203039-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Francesco Bandiera (M'01) was born in Maglie (LE), Italy, on March 9, 1974.

At the analysis stage, we assess the performance of the newly introduced receivers also in comparison with previously proposed detectors.

Specifically, we consider the problem of activating the lowest cost combination of at most L sensors that maintains a desired squared-error accuracy in the target's position estimate. For sensors that provide position information only, we develop a binary (0-1) mixed integer programming formulation for the scheduling problem and solve it using a linear programming relaxation-based branch-and-bound technique. For sensors that provide both position and velocity information, we pose the scheduling problem as a binary convex programming problem and solve it using the outer approximation algorithm. We apply our scheduling procedures in a network of sensors where the sensor-usage costs correspond to network energy consumption. Our simulation results demonstrate that scheduling using binary programming allows us to obtain optimal solutions to scheduling involving up to 50-70 sensors typically in the order of seconds","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4203048/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 May 2007","volume":"55","issue":"6","accessionNumber":"9472227","publicationDate":"June 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4203048/","dateOfInsertion":"21 May 2007","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"On the Use of Binary Programming for Sensor Scheduling","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the Use of Binary Programming for Sensor Scheduling","sourcePdf":"55tsp06-chhetri-pt2.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.102452S","chronDate":"June  2007","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"4203033","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"24","xplore-issue":"4203033","articleId":"4203048","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4203049,"authors":[{"name":"Doru-Florin Chiper","affiliation":["Center for Signal Processing and Communications, Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Concordia University, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/4203033/4203049/4203049-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Doru-Florin Chiper was born in Iasi, Romania, in 1956.

The proposed design facilitates trade-off between the throughput and hardware cost or power consumption, and is well suited for low-power applications. The VLSI structure is highly regular and modular with a topology well suited for the VLSI implementation. The proposed approach is based on the derivation of new efficient systolic algorithms. The algorithms have the same core structure for both the transforms, and the core structure consists of two circular correlations, which unlike other similar computational structures, have the same length and form. Thus, they can be computed in parallel and mapped on the same linear systolic array with channels having a low I/O bandwidth requirement and their number being independent of the transform length N. Further, it is shown that the two transforms, can be efficiently implemented on the same VLSI chip, where only the pre- and post-processing stages are different.

In practice, more sophisticated methods are used nowadays, threatening to make the power method a historical and pedagogic footnote. However, in the context of communication over a time-division duplex (TDD) multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) channel, the power method takes a special position. It can be viewed as an intrinsic part of the uplink and downlink communication switching, enabling estimation of the eigenmodes of the channel without extra overhead. Generalizing the method to vector subspaces, communication in the subspaces with the best receive and transmit signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is made possible.

Specifically, a comparative performance analysis is provided from a theoretical point of view, either when the second-order statistics (SOS) of the received data are exactly known at the receiver, or when they are estimated from a finite number of data samples. Relying on the results of this analysis, a three-stage constrained maximum-SINR equalizer is then proposed, which outperforms existing receivers and, in comparison with its unconstrained counterpart, exhibits a significantly stronger robustness against errors in the estimated SOS. Moreover, a computationally efficient adaptive implementation of the three-stage equalizer is derived, and in connection with it, a simple and effective NBI-resistant channel estimation algorithm is proposed.

In its full generality, this problem is known to be NP-complete. Recently, the expected complexity of the sphere decoder, a particular algorithm that solves the ML problem exactly, has been computed. An asymptotic analysis of this complexity has also been done where it is shown that the required computations grow exponentially in N for any fixed SNR. At the same time, numerical computations of the expected complexity show that there are certain ranges of rates, SNRs and dimensions N for which the expected computation (counted as the number of scalar multiplications) involves no more than N\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">3</sup>\n computations. However, when the dimension of the problem grows too large, the required computations become prohibitively large, as expected from the asymptotic exponential complexity. In this paper, we propose an algorithm that, for large N, offers substantial computational savings over the sphere decoder, while maintaining performance arbitrarily close to ML. We statistically prune the search space to a subset that, with high probability, contains the optimal solution, thereby reducing the complexity of the search. Bounds on the error performance of the new method are proposed. The complexity of the new algorithm is analyzed through an upper bound. The asymptotic behavior of the upper bound for large N is also analyzed which shows that the upper bound is also exponential but much lower than the sphere decoder.

The existing source coding schemes based on turbo codes, low-density parity check codes, and repeat accumulate codes can be regarded as practical implementations of this random binning scheme. For sufficiently large data blocks, we show that the proposed scheme asymptotically achieves the entropy limit. We also derive the distribution of the compression rate achieved by the tree-structured random binning scheme. Comparing this distribution with the distribution obtained using a library of random binning schemes, we show that a nested code can achieve rates close to a library of codes but with much lower encoding/decoding complexity. With lossless turbo source coding being one of the most powerful source compression techniques, we investigate its performance relative to the proposed tree-structured random binning scheme. Our numerical results show that the compression rate achieved by lossless turbo source coding is far from the tree-structured random binning bound.

The sequence of states sampled at multiple target-sensor orientations may be modeled as a Markov process. The sensor only has access to the scattered fields, without knowledge of the particular state being sampled, and, therefore, the problem is modeled as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP).

Contrary to most other publications on Tomlinson-Harashima precoding which rely on solutions for decision feedback equalization to find the corresponding precoding filters in a heuristic manner, we deduce the optimization for Tomlinson-Harashima precoding from the optimization for the linear minimum mean square error transmit filter. Thereby, we include the precoding order explicitly in the problem formulation and thus obtain the precoding filter solutions, together with the algorithms to compute the latency time, i.e., the time difference between application of the precoder at the transmitter and detection at the receiver and the precoding order from a single optimization. Since the algorithm for THP filter computation resulting from the optimization has a high computational complexity, we present an alternative algorithm to compute the Tomlinson-Harashima precoding filters based on a Cholesky factorization with symmetric permutation, resulting in an order of complexity that is the same as for the computation of the linear transmit filters. The simulations reveal that the latency time optimization can be omitted without performance degradation for most practical channel models, i.e., the latency time can be chosen to be the order of the feedforward filter","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2007.893954","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/4203033/04203081.pdf","startPage":"3073","endPage":"3088","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2007.893954","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4203033","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Finite-Length MMSE Tomlinson\u2013Harashima Precoding for Frequency Selective Vector Channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4203081","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 May 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4203081/","displayDocTitle":"Finite-Length MMSE Tomlinson\u2013Harashima Precoding for Frequency Selective Vector Channels","volume":"55","issue":"6","publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"9472247","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4203081/","dateOfInsertion":"21 May 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Finite-Length MMSE Tomlinson\u2013Harashima Precoding for Frequency Selective Vector Channels","sourcePdf":"55tsp06-joham-pt2.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.141991S","chronDate":"June  2007","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"4203033","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"4203033","articleId":"4203081","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4203083,"authors":[{"name":"Rodney A.

The multipath fields are studied as solutions to the wave equation in an infinite-dimensional vector space. We prove two universal upper bounds on the truncation error of fixed and random multipath fields. A direct consequence of the derived bounds is that both fixed and random multipath fields have an effective finite dimension. For circular and spherical spatial regions, we show that this finite dimension is proportional to the radius and area of the region, respectively. We use the Karhunen-Loegraveve (KL) expansion of random multipath fields to quantify the notion of multipath richness. The multipath richness is defined as the number of significant eigenvalues in the KL expansion that achieve 99% of the total multipath energy. We establish a lower bound on the largest eigenvalue. This lower bound quantifies, to some extent, the well-known reduction of multipath richness with reducing the angular power spread of multipath angular power spectrum","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4203083/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 May 2007","volume":"55","issue":"6","accessionNumber":"9472271","publicationDate":"June 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4203083/","dateOfInsertion":"21 May 2007","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Intrinsic Limits of Dimensionality and Richness in Random Multipath Fields","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Intrinsic Limits of Dimensionality and Richness in Random Multipath Fields","sourcePdf":"55tsp06-kennedy-pt1.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.140985S","chronDate":"June  2007","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"4203035","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"148","xplore-issue":"4203035","articleId":"4203083","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-12"},{"_id":4203086,"authors":[{"name":"Vitaly Kober","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Division of Applied Physics, CICESE, Ensenada, Baja California, Mexico"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/4203033/4203086/4203086-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Vitaly Kober (M'06) received the M.Sc. degree with honors in applied mathematics from the Air-Space University of Samara, Samara, Russia, in 1984, and the Ph.D. and D.Sc. degrees in digital image processing from the Institute of Information Transmission Problems, Russian Academy of Sciences, Moscow, Russia, in 1992 and 2004.","He is currently a Professor with the Center of Scientific Research and High Education of Ensenada (CICESE), Mexico.

However, there exists a performance gap between the min-sum and belief-propagation algorithms due to nonlinear approximation. In this paper, a self-compensation technique using dynamic normalization is thus proposed to improve the approximation accuracy. The proposed scheme scales the min-sum algorithm by a dynamic factor that can be derived theoretically from order statistics. Moreover, applying the proposed technique to several LDPC codes for DVB-S2 system, the average signal-to-noise ratio degradation, which results from approximation inaccuracy and quantization error, is reduced to 0.2 dB. Not only does it enhance the error-correcting capability of the min-sum algorithm, but the proposed self-compensation technique also preserves a modest hardware cost.

The number of nontrivial coefficients of a digital filter designed using the FRM technique is only a very small fraction of that of a minimax optimum design meeting the same set of specifications. A digital filter designed using FRM technique is a network of several subfilters. Several methods have been developed for optimizing the subfilters. The earliest method optimizes the subfilters separately and produces a network of subfilters with excellent finite word-length performance. Subsequent techniques optimize the subfilters jointly and produce filters with significantly smaller numbers of nontrivial coefficients. Unfortunately, these joint optimization techniques, that optimize only the overall frequency response characteristics, may produce filters with undesirable finite word-length properties. The design of FRM-based filters that simultaneously optimizes the frequency response and finite word-length properties had not been reported in the literatures. In this paper, we develop several new optimization approaches that include the finite word-length properties of the overall filter into the optimization process. These new approaches produce filters with excellent finite word-length performance with almost no degradation in frequency response performance","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4203090/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 May 2007","volume":"55","issue":"6","accessionNumber":"9472234","publicationDate":"June 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4203090/","dateOfInsertion":"21 May 2007","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"FRM-Based FIR Filters With Optimum Finite Word-Length Performance","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FRM-Based FIR Filters With Optimum Finite Word-Length Performance","sourcePdf":"55tsp06-lim-pt2.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.113513S","chronDate":"June  2007","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"4203033","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"30","xplore-issue":"4203033","articleId":"4203090","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4203091,"authors":[{"name":"Chong Lin","affiliation":["National University of Singapore, Singapore","Institute of Complexity Science, Qingdao University of China, Qingdao, China"],"firstName":"Chong","lastName":"Lin","id":"37404176900"},{"name":"Qing-Guo Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, National University of Singapore, Singapore"],"firstName":"Qing-Guo","lastName":"Wang","id":"37291367300"},{"name":"Tong Heng Lee","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, National University of Singapore, Singapore"],"firstName":"Tong Heng","lastName":"Lee","id":"37277268600"},{"name":"Yong He","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Engineering, Central South University, Changsha, China"],"firstName":"Yong","lastName":"He","id":"37272942500"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1053-587X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0476"}],"articleNumber":"4203091","dbTime":"21 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":114,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":446},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.signalprocessingsociety.org"}],"abstract":"This correspondence is concerned with the H\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">infin</sub>\n filter design for Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) fuzzy systems with state-delay.

The optimization problem is formulated in an equivalent unconstrained generalized-sidelobe-canceller (GSC) setup. The channel parameter error is explicitly incorporated into the constraint-free GSC system model through the perturbation technique; this allows us to exploit the presumed LS channel error property for deriving a closed-form solution, and can also facilitate an associated analytic performance analysis. A closed-form approximate signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) expression for the proposed robust scheme is given, and an appealing formula of the achievable SINR improvement over the nonrobust counterpart is further specified.

The basic assumption is the same as in Morellis' work (OFDMA), i.e., active users in the network are classified into two categories: reference (synchronized) users (RUs) and new (asynchronized) users (NUs). But, we consider the system that RUs use CDMA to share the wireless medium. NUs employ time-division multiple-access (TDMA) for the training purpose. Our major idea is to perform the CFO estimation in the desired signal subspace that is orthogonal to the RU subspace. The proposed approach is investigated both in the subband and interleaved MC-CDMA systems. It is shown that implementation of the CFO estimation together with the training-pattern design could be relatively simple when users do not experience the considerable frequency-selective fade. In the highly frequency-selective fading scenario, an adaptive training-scheme is proposed to make the CFO estimator robust. We also consider NUs operating in the frequency-division multiple-access (FDMA) training mode. Due to the presence of inter-NU-interference, the estimation performance may be not as good as in the TDMA training mode. The performance degradation may be severe when RUs operate in the interleaved MC-CDMA.

In particular, we tackle the question of whether a performance close to the optimum can be achieved for small values of the rank. To answer this question, it is standard to consider the output signal-to-interference plus noise ratio (SINR), and to study its convergence speed versus the rank of the receiver. Unfortunately, this task is difficult due to the fact that the SINR expressions depend on the spreading codes allocated to the various users in a rather complicated way. To be able to obtain positive results, we assume that the spreading factor and the number of users tend to infinity while their ratio remains finite. As in the third-generation UMTS system, the spreading codes we consider coincide with orthogonal Walsh-Hadamard codes scrambled by an independent identically distributed sequence. In this context, we show that the SINR of each reduced-rank receiver converges toward a deterministic limit which depends only of the rank of the receiver, and not of the spreading codes given to the various users. Using some previous results, we prove that the asymptotic SINRs converge exponentially to the SINR of the plain Wiener receiver when the rank of the receiver increases.

The conventional nonregenerative approach is the amplify and forward (A&F) approach, where the signal received at the relay is simply amplified and retransmitted. In this paper, we propose an alternative linear transceiver design for nonregenerative relaying (including pure relaying and the cooperative transmission cases), making proper use of CSI at the relay station. Specifically, we design the optimum linear filtering performed on the data to be forwarded at the relay. As optimization criteria, we have considered the maximization of mutual information (that provides an information rate for which reliable communication is possible) for a given available transmission power at the relay station. Three different levels of CSI can be considered at the relay station: only first hop channel information (between the source and relay); first hop channel and second hop channel (between relay and destination) information, or a third situation where the relay may have complete cooperative channel information including all the links: first and second hop channels and also the direct channel between source and destination. Despite the latter being a more unrealistic situation, since it requires the destination to inform the relay station about the direct channel, it is useful as an upper benchmark. In this paper, we consider the last two cases relating to CSI. We compare the performance so obtained with the performance for the conventional A&F approach, and also with the performance of regenerative relays and direct noncooperative transmission for two particular cases: narrowband multiple-input multiple-output transceivers and wideband single input single output orthogonal frequency division multiplex transmissions","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2006.890913","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/4203035/04203099.pdf","startPage":"2593","endPage":"2604","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2006.890913","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4203035","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Linear Transceiver Design in Nonregenerative Relays With Channel State Information","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4203099","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 May 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4203099/","displayDocTitle":"Linear Transceiver Design in Nonregenerative Relays With Channel State Information","volume":"55","issue":"6","publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"9472275","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4203099/","dateOfInsertion":"21 May 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Linear Transceiver Design in Nonregenerative Relays With Channel State Information","sourcePdf":"55tsp06-munoz-pt1.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.070365S","chronDate":"June  2007","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"4203035","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"371","xplore-issue":"4203035","articleId":"4203099","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4203101,"authors":[{"name":"Shahrokh Nayeb Nazar","affiliation":["School of Mathematics, University of Manchester, Institute of Science and Technology, Manchester, UK"],"firstName":"Shahrokh","lastName":"Nayeb Nazar","id":"37087023336"},{"name":"Ioannis N.

Coded transmission over fading channels is usually performed by interleaving the code word over a large time interval and arranging it into data packets (or blocks) that include also pilot symbols to allow the estimation of the time-varying channel. In this paper, we propose to exploit this block-based structure, and also the inherent latency of soft-iterative receivers due to data interleaving, to improve the channel estimate accuracy. Within the observed frame of blocks, the MB approach uses the invariance of some multipath features, such as delays and mean powers, to estimate the covariance matrix of the channel vector and to identify the corresponding channel subspace. Here, the MB method is extended to incorporate soft information, which is available in iterative receiver structures. The performance of this soft-iterative method is derived in terms of mean square error of the estimate by using a general framework that applies also to other soft-based methods in the literature. A performance comparison is carried out among these estimation methods, both analytically and by numerical simulations, showing the benefits of the proposed approach on the turbo equalizer convergence","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2007.893979","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/4203033/04203103.pdf","startPage":"2993","endPage":"3006","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2007.893979","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4203033","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Soft-Iterative Channel Estimation: Methods and Performance Analysis","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4203103","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 May 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4203103/","displayDocTitle":"Soft-Iterative Channel Estimation: Methods and Performance Analysis","volume":"55","issue":"6","publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"9472241","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4203103/","dateOfInsertion":"21 May 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Soft-Iterative Channel Estimation: Methods and Performance Analysis","sourcePdf":"55tsp06-nicoli-pt2.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.091777S","chronDate":"June  2007","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"4203033","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"28","xplore-issue":"4203033","articleId":"4203103","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4203111,"authors":[{"name":"Runyi Yu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Eastern Mediterranean University, Turkey"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/4203035/4203111/4203111-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Runyi Yu (M'95\u2013SM'99) received the Ph.D. degree in automatic control from Beijing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Beijing, China.","He is an Associate Professor in the Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Eastern Mediterranean University, Gazimagusa, North Cyprus.

In contrast to the conventional sum-power constraint on the transmit antennas, this paper adopts a more realistic per-antenna power constraint, because in practical implementations each antenna is equipped with its own power amplifier and is limited individually by the linearity of the amplifier. Assuming perfect channel knowledge at the transmitter, this paper investigates two different transmission schemes under the per-antenna power constraint: a minimum-power beamforming design for downlink channels with a single antenna at each remote user and a capacity-achieving transmitter design for downlink channels with multiple antennas at each remote user. It is shown that in both cases, the per-antenna downlink transmitter optimization problem may be transformed into a dual uplink problem with an uncertain noise. This generalizes previous uplink-downlink duality results and transforms the per-antenna transmitter optimization problem into an equivalent minimax optimization problem. Further, it is shown that various notions of uplink-downlink duality may be unified under a Lagrangian duality framework. This new interpretation of duality gives rise to efficient numerical optimization techniques for solving the downlink per-antenna transmitter optimization problem","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4203115/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 May 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2007","volume":"55","issue":"6","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9472279","dateOfInsertion":"21 May 2007","publicationDate":"June 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4203115/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Transmitter Optimization for the Multi-Antenna Downlink With Per-Antenna Power Constraints","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Transmitter Optimization for the Multi-Antenna Downlink With Per-Antenna Power Constraints","sourcePdf":"55tsp06-wyu-pt1.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.090217S","chronDate":"June  2007","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"4203035","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"548","xplore-issue":"4203035","articleId":"4203115","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4203116,"authors":[{"name":"Jun Xiao","affiliation":["Physics Department (UMR 5672 CNRS), Ecole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure de Lyon, Lyon, France"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/4203033/4203116/4203116-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jun Xiao received the B.E. degree in optoelectronics and the M.S. degree in optics (with highest honors) from East China Normal University, Shanghai, China, in 2002 and 2005, respectively.

In the past, methods for model alignment have either used normalization techniques, such as PCA alignment, or have performed an exhaustive search over the space of rotation to find the best optimal alignment. While normalization techniques have the advantage of efficiency, providing a quick method for registering two shapes, they are often imprecise and can give rise to poor alignments. Conversely, exhaustive search is guaranteed to provide the correct answer, but, even using efficient signal processing techniques, this type of approach can be prohibitively slow. In this paper, we present a new method for aligning two 3D shapes. We show that the method is markedly faster than existing approaches based on efficient signal processing and we provide registration results demonstrating that the alignments obtained using our method have a high degree of precision and are markedly better than those obtained using normalization.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4204164/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 May 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2007","volume":"29","issue":"7","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9614135","pubMedId":"17496379","dateOfInsertion":"21 May 2007","publicationDate":"July 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4204164/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"An Approximate and Efficient Method for Optimal Rotation Alignment of 3D Models","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Approximate and Efficient Method for Optimal Rotation Alignment of 3D Models","sourcePdf":"i1221.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.107572S","chronDate":"July  2007","xplore-pub-id":"34","isNumber":"4204153","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"50","xplore-issue":"4204153","articleId":"4204164","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4205048,"authors":[{"name":"Jia Tang","affiliation":["Networking and Information Systems Laboratory, Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Texas A and M University, College Station, TX, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/49/4205044/4205048/4205048-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jia Tang (S'03) received the B.S. degree in Electrical Engineering from Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, China, in 2001.

This delay constraint is characterized by the so-called QoS exponent thetas, which is the only requested information exchanged between the physical layer and the datalink layer in our cross-layer design based scheme. Over both amplify-and-forwards (AF) and decode-and-forward (DF) relay networks; the authors develop the associated dynamic resource allocation algorithms for wireless multimedia communications. Over DF relay network, the authors also study a fixed power allocation scheme to provide QoS guarantees. The simulations and numerical results verify that our proposed cross-layer resource allocation can efficiently support diverse QoS requirements over wireless relay networks. Both AF and DF relays show significant superiorities over direct transmissions when the delay QoS constraints are stringent. On the other hand, the results demonstrate the importance of deploying the dynamic resource allocation for stringent delay QoS guarantees.","doi":"10.1109/JSAC.2007.070502","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/49/4205044/04205048.pdf","startPage":"645","endPage":"656","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2007.070502","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4205044","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cross-layer resource allocation over wireless relay networks for quality of service provisioning","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4205048","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 May 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4205048/","displayDocTitle":"Cross-layer resource allocation over wireless relay networks for quality of service provisioning","volume":"25","issue":"4","publicationDate":"May 2007","accessionNumber":"9575184","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4205048/","dateOfInsertion":"21 May 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cross-layer resource allocation over wireless relay networks for quality of service provisioning","sourcePdf":"js_0704_645.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.062153S","chronDate":"May  2007","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"4205044","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"179","xplore-issue":"4205044","articleId":"4205048","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-28"},{"_id":4205049,"authors":[{"name":"Yu-jung Chang","affiliation":["Integrated Media Systems Center and the Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/49/4205044/4205049/4205049-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yu-Jung Chang received the B.S. degree from the National Tsing Hua University, Taiwan, in 2000, the M.S. degree from the National Chiao Tung University, Taiwan, in 2002, and is currently pursuing his Ph.D. degree at the University of Southern California (USC), Los Angeles, all in Electrical Engineering.","Since January 2005, he has been a Research Assistant in EE department at USC.

We take a cross-layer approach and analyze several quality-of-service (QoS) measures that incilude the bit rate and the bit error rate (BER) in the physical layer, and packet average throughput/delay and packet maximum delay in the link layer. The authors adopt a cross-layer QoS framework similar to that in IEEE 802.16, where service classification, flow control and opportunistic scheduling with different subcarrier/bit allocation schemes are implemented. In the analysis, the Rayleigh fading channel in the link layer is modeled by a finite-state Markov chain, and the channel state information (CSI) is assumed to be available at the base station. With the M/G/1 queueing model and flow control results, the analysis provides important insights into the performance difference of these two multiaccess systems. The derived analytical results are verified by extensive computer simulation. It is demonstrated by analysis and simulation that OFDMA outperforms OFDM-TDMA in QoS metrics of interest. Thus, OFDMA has higher potential than OFDM-TDMA in supporting multimedia services.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/49/4205044/04205049.pdf","startPage":"657","endPage":"666","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","doi":"10.1109/JSAC.2007.070503","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2007.070503","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4205044","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4205049","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cross-layer QoS Analysis of Opportunistic OFDM-TDMA and OFDMA Networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Performance analysis","Bit rate","Bit error rate","Delay","OFDM","Frequency conversion","Quality of service","Physical layer","Throughput","Information analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["error statistics","frequency division multiple access","IEEE standards","Markov processes","OFDM modulation","quality of service"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cross-layer QoS analysis","OFDM-TDMA","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","opportunistic scheduling","queueing model","channel state information","finite-state Markov chain","IEEE 802.16","bit error rate","quality of service","multimedia transmission","orthogonal frequency division multiple access"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4205049/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 May 2007","displayDocTitle":"Cross-layer QoS Analysis of Opportunistic OFDM-TDMA and OFDMA Networks","volume":"25","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/4205049/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2007","accessionNumber":"9575185","dateOfInsertion":"21 May 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cross-layer QoS Analysis of Opportunistic OFDM-TDMA and OFDMA Networks","sourcePdf":"js_0704_657.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.06813S","chronDate":"May  2007","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"4205044","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"41","xplore-issue":"4205044","articleId":"4205049","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4205050,"authors":[{"name":"Bechir Hamdaoui","affiliation":["EECS Department, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/49/4205044/4205050/4205050-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Bechir Hamdaoui received the Diploma of Graduate Engineer from the National School of Engineers at Tunis (BAC+6+DEA, ENIT), Tunisia, in 1997.

Because multiple antennas offer wireless networks a potential capacity increase, they are expected to be a key part of next-generation wireless networks to support the rapidly emerging multimedia applications characterized by their high and diverse QoS requirements. This paper developed methods that exploit the benefits of multiple antennas to enable multi-hop wireless networks with flow-level QoS capabilities. The authors first propose a cross-layer table-driven statistical approach that allows each node to determine the amount of spatial reuse and/or multiplexing, offered by the multiple antennas that are available to it. The authors then use the developed statistical approach to derive sufficient conditions under which flow rates are guaranteed to be feasible. The derived conditions are multi-layer aware in the sense that they account for cross-layer effects between the PHY and the MAC layers to support QoS at higher layers. The authors evaluate and compare the derived sufficient conditions via extensive simulations. The authors show that the conditions result in high flow acceptance rates when used in multi-hop wireless networking problems such as QoS routing and multicommodity flow problems. The authors also demonstrate the importance and the effect of considering cross-layer couplings into the development of flow acceptance methods.","doi":"10.1109/JSAC.2007.070504","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/49/4205044/04205050.pdf","startPage":"667","endPage":"677","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2007.070504","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4205044","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cross-Layer Optimized Conditions for QoS Support in Multi-Hop Wireless Networks with MIMO Links","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4205050","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 May 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4205050/","displayDocTitle":"Cross-Layer Optimized Conditions for QoS Support in Multi-Hop Wireless Networks with MIMO Links","volume":"25","issue":"4","publicationDate":"May 2007","accessionNumber":"9575186","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4205050/","dateOfInsertion":"21 May 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cross-Layer Optimized Conditions for QoS Support in Multi-Hop Wireless Networks with MIMO Links","sourcePdf":"js_0704_667.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.088704S","chronDate":"May  2007","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"4205044","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"4205044","articleId":"4205050","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4205053,"authors":[{"name":"Jose Villalon","affiliation":["Instituto de Investigaci\u00f3n en Inform\u00e1tica de Albacete, Albacete, Spain"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/49/4205044/4205053/4205053-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jos\u00e9 Villal\u00f3n received his M.Sc. degree in Computer Science from the University of Castilla-La Mancha, Albacete, Spain in 2003.

It is not sufficient that only the video codec or only the underlying protocols adapt to changes in the wireless link quality. Research efforts should be applied in both and in a synchronized way. Cross layer design is a new paradigm that addresses this challenge by optimizing communication network architectures across traditional layer boundaries. This paper presents cross-layer architecture for adaptive video multicast streaming over multirate wireless LANs where layer-specific information is passed in both directions, top-down and bottom-up. The authors jointly consider three layers of the protocol stack: the application, data link and physical layers. The authors analyze the performance of the proposed architecture and extensively evaluate it via simulations. The results show that the real-time video quality of the overall system can be greatly improved by cross-layer signaling.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cross-layer architecture for adaptive video multicast streaming over multirate wireless LANs","doi":"10.1109/JSAC.2007.070507","endPage":"711","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/49/4205044/04205053.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","startPage":"699","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2007.070507","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4205044","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4205053","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Streaming media","Wireless LAN","Video codecs","Wireless application protocol","Cross layer design","Design optimization","Communication networks","Physical layer","Performance analysis","Analytical models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multicast communication","video codecs","video streaming","wireless LAN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cross-layer architecture","adaptive video multicast streaming","multirate wireless LAN","multicast video streaming","video codec","protocol stack","real-time video quality","cross-layer signaling","video adaptation","wireless multicast transmission"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Cross-layer architecture for adaptive video multicast streaming over multirate wireless LANs","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4205053/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 May 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2007","volume":"25","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/4205053/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2007","dateOfInsertion":"21 May 2007","accessionNumber":"9575189","isDynamicHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cross-layer architecture for adaptive video multicast streaming over multirate wireless LANs","sourcePdf":"js_0704_699.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.064005S","chronDate":"May  2007","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"4205044","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"85","xplore-issue":"4205044","articleId":"4205053","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":4205056,"authors":[{"name":"Min Cao","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, IL, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/49/4205044/4205056/4205056-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Min Cao received his B.S. and M.S. from Tsinghua University, Beijing, China in 1998 and 2001 respectively.

In this paper, we consider the joint optimal design of routing, medium access control (MAC) scheduling and physical layer resource allocation for such networks, where beamforming antenna arrays are equipped at the physical layer. The notion of transmission set (TS) is introduced to separate the physical layer operations from those at the upper layers; and a column generation approach is employed to efficiently identify the TSs. We then apply the dual decomposition method to decouple the routing and scheduling subproblems, which are performed at different layers and are coordinated by a pricing mechanism to achieve the optimal overall system objective. To efficiently support multimedia traffic, an admission control criterion is considered for the system objective. The performance of the proposed scheme is verified by simulation results, and the impact of the physical layer capabilities on the network performance is evaluated. We also discuss the implementation issues of the cross-layer scheme based on the IEEE 802.16 mesh mode.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multi-hop wireless backhaul networks: a cross-layer design paradigm","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","doi":"10.1109/JSAC.2007.070510","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/49/4205044/04205056.pdf","startPage":"738","endPage":"748","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2007.070510","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4205044","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4205056","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4205056/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 May 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2007","displayDocTitle":"Multi-hop wireless backhaul networks: a cross-layer design paradigm","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"25","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/4205056/","dateOfInsertion":"21 May 2007","publicationDate":"May 2007","accessionNumber":"9575192","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multi-hop wireless backhaul networks: a cross-layer design paradigm","sourcePdf":"js_0704_738.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.08619S","chronDate":"May  2007","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"4205044","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"56","xplore-issue":"4205044","articleId":"4205056","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4205057,"authors":[{"name":"Peshala Pahalawatta","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering and Computer Science Department, Northwestern University, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/49/4205044/4205057/4205057-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Peshala V.

The scheme can be used with the emerging wireless standards such as HSDPA and IEEE 802.16. A gradient based scheduling scheme is used in which user data rates are dynamically adjusted based on channel quality as well as the gradients of a utility function. The user utilities are designed as a function of the distortion of the received video. This enables distortion-aware packet scheduling both within and across multiple users. The utility takes into account decoder error concealment, an important component in deciding the received quality of the video. We consider both simple and complex error concealment techniques. Simulation results show that the gradient based scheduling framework combined with the content-aware utility functions provides a viable method for downlink packet scheduling as it can significantly outperform current content-independent techniques. Further tests determine the sensitivity of the system to the initial video encoding schemes, as well as to non-real-time packet ordering techniques.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/49/4205044/04205057.pdf","startPage":"749","endPage":"759","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","doi":"10.1109/JSAC.2007.070511","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2007.070511","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4205044","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4205057","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Content-aware resource allocation and packet scheduling for video transmission over wireless networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Resource management","Scheduling algorithm","Wireless networks","Streaming media","Multiaccess communication","Downlink","Wireless sensor networks","Throughput","Delay","Dynamic scheduling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["IEEE standards","multi-access systems","packet radio networks","resource allocation","scheduling","video coding","video streaming"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["content-aware resource allocation","video transmission","wireless networks","pre-encoded video","downlink packet access networks","wireless standards","HSDPA","IEEE 802.16.","gradient based scheduling scheme","channel quality","distortion-aware packet scheduling","cross-layer design","H.264","video streaming","wireless packet scheduling","video encoding schemes","content-aware utility functions","decoder error concealment"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4205057/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 May 2007","displayDocTitle":"Content-aware resource allocation and packet scheduling for video transmission over wireless networks","volume":"25","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/4205057/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2007","accessionNumber":"9575193","dateOfInsertion":"21 May 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Content-aware resource allocation and packet scheduling for video transmission over wireless networks","sourcePdf":"js_0704_749.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.163122S","chronDate":"May  2007","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"4205044","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"112","xplore-issue":"4205044","articleId":"4205057","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4205065,"authors":[{"name":"Dalei Wu","affiliation":["Department of Computer and Electronics Engineering, University of Nebraska, Lincoln, Omaha, NE, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/49/4205044/4205065/4205065-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Dalei Wu (S'05) received his B.S. and M.Eng. degrees in electrical engineering from Shandong University, Jinan, China, in 2001 and 2004, respectively.

In this paper, we propose a cross-layer optimization framework for delivering video summaries over wireless networks. Within a rate-distortion theoretical framework, the source coding, allowable retransmission, and adaptive modulation and coding have been jointly optimized, which reflects the joint selection of parameters at physical, data link and application layers. The goal is to achieve the best video quality and content coverage of the received summary frames and to meet the delay constraint. The problem is solved using Lagirangian relaxation and dynamic programming. Experimental results indicate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed optimization framework, especially when the delay budget imposed by the upper layer applications is small, where more than 10% distortion gain can be achieved.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/49/4205044/04205065.pdf","startPage":"841","endPage":"850","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","doi":"10.1109/JSAC.2007.070519","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2007.070519","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4205044","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4205065","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cross-layer optimization for video summary transmission over wireless networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wireless networks","Automatic repeat request","Streaming media","Rate-distortion","Propagation losses","Modulation coding","Source coding","Delay","Physical layer","Protocols"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive codes","adaptive modulation","dynamic programming","multimedia communication","radio networks","relaxation","video coding","video communication","video streaming"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["video summary transmission","wireless networks","multimedia communication","video summary frames","cross-layer optimization framework","source coding","allowable retransmission","adaptive modulation","physical layers","data link layers","application layers","video quality","Lagirangian relaxation","dynamic programming","universal multimedia access","video summarization","adaptive coding","automatic repeat request","rate distortion","video communication"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4205065/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 May 2007","displayDocTitle":"Cross-layer optimization for video summary transmission over wireless networks","volume":"25","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/4205065/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2007","accessionNumber":"9575201","dateOfInsertion":"21 May 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cross-layer optimization for video summary transmission over wireless networks","sourcePdf":"js_0704_841.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.106904S","chronDate":"May  2007","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"4205044","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"70","xplore-issue":"4205044","articleId":"4205065","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4205085,"authors":[{"name":"Jean-francois Chamberland","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering."],"bio":{"p":["Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Chamberland (chmbrlnd@tamu.edu) received the Ph.D. degree in 2004 from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, the M.S. degree in 2000 from Cornell University, Ithaca, NY, and the B.Eng. degree in 1998 from McGill University, Montreal, Canada, all in electrical engineering.

In the first part of this article, we provide a tutorial survey on various power allocation strategies for cooperative networks based on different cooperation strategies, optimizing criteria, and CSI assumptions. In the second part, we identify the similarities between cooperative networks and several sensor network applications that utilize collaboration among distributed sensors to achieve the system goal.

It has been shown that while adaptive transmission efficiently utilizes the available bandwidth and transmit power, feedback constraints could be a significant impediment. Channel prediction can be employed to compensate the impact of feedback delay but its effectiveness would depend on the accuracy of the channel model. It is also showed that feedback errors could cause outage regions where AMC is not feasible and could also impact the benefits of multiuser scheduling. Limited feedback is a major issue for MIMO-AMC systems because channel state information grows with the rank of the MIMO system, the number of transmission modes, and the number of users for broadcast systems. Since feedback transmission consumes resources that could otherwise be used for data transmission on the reverse channel, feedback design is extremely important especially for power-limited devices such as mobile stations.

Multimode terminals supporting an increasingly large variety of standards (cellular, WLANs, WMANs, WPANs) are subject to a cost increase that is addressed by more flexible radio interfaces. Energy efficiency, however, is the main obstacle to successfully deploying such reconfigurable radios. To address this, it is essential to design energy-scalable SDRs, both for the radio front-end and the digital baseband platform. Complementing this, an essential ingredient is an intelligent controller that optimally exploits this scalability and the run-time dynamics to translate potential energy scalability to actual low-power operation. To realize this goal, an energy-aware cross-layer radio management framework is introduced. It was instantiated in different case studies, showing the applicability of this approach in realistic setups. Results have shown that substantial gains can be achieved through effective cross-layer optimization and problem partitioning. Next, it was shown that SDRs will play a crucial role in enabling CRs, which will enable saving on both the scarce radio spectrum and battery lifetime. A key building block for the design of such CRs, i.e., the appropriate control intelligence to make the SDR platform cognitive, can be derived by incrementally building on the proposed framework.

The realization of this kind of systems, however, requires resources that are both quantitatively and qualitatively different from conventional, off-the-shelf platforms. In this article, we describe a novel hardware platform aimed at the realization of cellular architectures. The system is built hierarchically from a very simple computing unit, called ECell. Several of these units can then be connected, using a high-speed serial communication protocol, to a more complex structure called the EStack. Consisting of four different kinds of interconnected boards (computational, routing, power supply, and display), these stacks can then be joined together to form an arbitrarily large parallel network of programmable circuits","doi":"10.1109/WEAH.2007.361706","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Workshop on Evolvable and Adaptive Hardware (WEAH2007)","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Workshop on Evolvable and Adaptive Hardware (WEAH2007)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4205224/4205225/04205229.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WEAH.2007.361706","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4205225","startPage":"8","endPage":"14","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A novel platform for complex bio-inspired architectures","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4205229","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A novel platform for complex bio-inspired architectures","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-5 April 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4205229/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"1-5 April 2007","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"2007","accessionNumber":"9507270","dateOfInsertion":"04 September 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4205229/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A novel platform for complex bio-inspired architectures","confLoc":"Honolulu, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"S001P002.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.087487S","chronDate":"1-5 April 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4205224","isNumber":"4205225","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4205224","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4205225","articleId":"4205229","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4205236,"authors":[{"name":"John C.

EH, to be most effective, requires its users to surrender significant amounts of design authority to an automated process. Even though EH has shown significant promise in creating novel designs, working engineers often show reluctance in relying on them.

Moreover, all machine windings supposed to be sinusoidally distributed in space and the system are magnetically linear. With the above-mentioned assumptions, the current-equivalent equations, voltage-equivalent equations, and the rotor-motion equations are formed and combined to implement the fault simulations. Simulation results showing the fault currents, during a single-phase-to-ground fault, a two-phase-to-ground fault, and a phase-to-phase fault, are presented here.

A phase dead-time compensation voltage (DTCV) to compensate the disturbance voltage due to undesirable characteristics of inverter, such as dead time, turn on/off time of switching devices, and on-voltages of switching devices and diode, is transformed into q-axis DTCV in the rotor reference frame. The relationship between q-axis DTCV and a dead-time compensation time (DTCT) is investigated. DTCT is identified online by using q-axis disturbance voltage, which is estimated by a disturbance observer. The amplitude of phase DTCV is adaptively determined according to the identified DTCT. The accuracy of identified DTCT is experimentally confirmed by calculating the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) between calculated active power and measured one. MAPE for adaptive DTCT is within 5% at any operating point and is less than that for the fixed DTCT.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive Dead-Time Compensation Strategy for Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motor Drive","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion","doi":"10.1109/TEC.2006.875469","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion","pdfPath":"/iel5/60/4207419/04207477.pdf","startPage":"271","endPage":"280","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TEC.2006.875469","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4207419","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4207477","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Geoscience"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4207477/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 May 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2007","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive Dead-Time Compensation Strategy for Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motor Drive","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"22","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/4207477/","dateOfInsertion":"21 May 2007","publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"9512646","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive Dead-Time Compensation Strategy for Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motor Drive","sourcePdf":"22tec02-urasaki.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.056403S","chronDate":"June  2007","xplore-pub-id":"60","isNumber":"4207419","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"60","citationCount":"113","xplore-issue":"4207419","articleId":"4207477","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-28"},{"_id":4207482,"authors":[{"name":"Chi Zhang","affiliation":["Center for Advanced Power Electronics, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/60/4207419/4207482/4207482-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Chi Zhang (S'03) was born in P.R.

It is found that, due to the gain saturation and limited linewidth-enhancement factor of the SOA, the peak power of a packet pulse with an optically controlled delay of 9.9 mus is 4.83 dB lower than that of a packet pulse without storage. In order to eliminate the 4.83-dB output power fluctuation of the DLOB, a simple power-equalization method based on the optimization of an optical control pulse is proposed. By injecting a negative optical control pulse, the output power fluctuation of a packet pulse can be effectively reduced to zero. We have also investigated the peak power level of the optical control pulse required to fulfil the buffer function. It is found that the SOA with larger linewidth-enhancement factor and larger small-signal gain should be used to reduce the peak power of the optical control pulse. It is also theoretically found that, due to the negative optical-control pulse injection, the packet signal with Gaussian profile has some distortion after storage. However, the distortion effect is mitigated when the shape of the input pulse is more similar to the square profile. Finally, the proposed method for achieving power equalization in an SOA-based optical buffer has been justified by carrying out a 2.5-Gb/s 2times2 exchange-bypass optical switch experiment. We believe that this power-equalization method can be also applied to other SOA cross-phase modulation-based applications","doi":"10.1109/JQE.2007.897915","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Quantum Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Quantum Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/3/4200821/04207494.pdf","startPage":"508","endPage":"516","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4200821","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JQE.2007.897915","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Power Equalization for SOA-Based Dual-Loop Optical Buffer by Optical Control Pulse Optimization","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 May 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4207494/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2007","displayDocTitle":"Power Equalization for SOA-Based Dual-Loop Optical Buffer by Optical Control Pulse Optimization","dateOfInsertion":"21 May 2007","publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"9469262","isJournal":true,"volume":"43","issue":"6","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Power Equalization for SOA-Based Dual-Loop Optical Buffer by Optical Control Pulse Optimization","sourcePdf":"43jqe06-li.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.042275S","chronDate":"June  2007","isNumber":"4200821","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3","citationCount":"7","articleId":"4207494","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4207520,"authors":[{"name":"Jiangtao Li","affiliation":["Intel Corporation, Hillsboro, OR, USA"],"firstName":"Jiangtao","lastName":"Li","id":"37066961500"},{"name":"Mikhail J.

These often involve collaborative optimizations where the two parties are, for example, jointly minimizing costs without violating their own particular constraints (e.g., one party may have too much inventory, another too little inventory but too much production capacity, etc). Many of these optimizations can be formulated as linear programming problems, or, rather, as collaborative linear programming, in which two parties need to jointly optimize based on their own private inputs. It is often important to have online collaboration techniques and protocols that carry this out without either party revealing to the other anything about their own private inputs to the optimization (other than, unavoidably, what can be deduced from the collaboratively computed optimal solution). For example, two organizations who jointly invest in a project may want to minimize some linear objective function while satisfying both organizations' private and confidential constraints. Constraints are usually private when they reveal too much about the organizations' financial health, its future business strategy, etc. Linear programming problems have been widely studied in the literature. However, the existing solutions (e.g., the simplex method) do not extend to the above-mentioned framework in which the linear constraints are shared by the two parties, who do not want to disclose their own to the other party. In this paper, we give an efficient protocol for solving linear programming problems in the honest-but-curious model, such that neither party reveals anything about their private input to the other party (other than what can be inferred from the result). The amount of communication and computation done by our protocol is proportional to the time complexity of the simplex method, a widely used linear programming algorithm. We also provide a practical solution that prevents certain malicious behavior of the participants. The use of the known general circuit-simulation solutions to secure function evaluation is unacceptable for the simplex method, as it implies an exponential size circuit","doi":"10.1109/COLCOM.2006.361848","publicationTitle":"2006 International Conference on Collaborative Computing: Networking, Applications and Worksharing","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 International Conference on Collaborative Computing: Networking, Applications and Worksharing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4207500/4207501/04207520.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/COLCOM.2006.361848","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4207501","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Secure and Private Collaborative Linear Programming","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4207520","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-20 Nov. 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4207520/","displayDocTitle":"Secure and Private Collaborative Linear Programming","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2006","accessionNumber":"9453949","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4207520/","conferenceDate":"17-20 Nov. 2006","dateOfInsertion":"21 May 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Secure and Private Collaborative Linear Programming","confLoc":"Atlanta, GA, USA","sourcePdf":"COLCOM-00-19.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.084294S","chronDate":"17-20 Nov. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4207500","isNumber":"4207501","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4207500","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"4207501","articleId":"4207520","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4207695,"authors":[{"name":"G.

The activation energy for the reaction has been obtained and equations relating temperature, current density and film structure to conductor life are presented. The activation energy appears to be identical to that for the lattice self-diffusion of aluminum modified by factors involving both surface diffusion and grain-boundary diffusion.

Metalization and bond failures are the principal modes of failure in integrated circuits. At high stress levels, inherent failure modes are most significant; these inherent failure modes are not, however, necessarily a factor in reliability at rated stress levels. Manufacturing defects are a major cause of failures at rated stress levels. At present there are no indications of a significant reliability advantage for any bonding or metalization system for general integrated circuit usage.

The migratory gold resistive short (MGRS) failure mode is one example of this mechanism and results in the formation of filamentary or dendritic deposits of gold between adjacent stripes. on the IC chip. This reaction requires the presence of a sufficient amount of water, a bias voltage between adjacent stripes, and the activation of the cathodic (-) stripe. Gold ions are transported from anode to cathode through a film of moisture adsorbed on the surface of the chip; halide ions are probably involved in the transfer. Their presence is verified experimentally by x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy.

Current densities of 4\u00d7106 A/cm2 and 1 \u00d7 107 A/cm2 were employed. Some tests were also performed at frequencies of 20 kHz and 100 kHz. The conductor lifetime was found to depend strongly on the pulse duty factor, with the mean time to failure, measured in on-time hours, showing a monotonic improvement as the duty factor of testing was decreased. At a pulse current density of 1 \u00d7 107 A/cm2, the results demonstrated the occurrence of electromigration in the direction of the \"electron wind\". A proportion of the improvement in the conductor lifetime is attributable to a decrease in the amount of conductor self-heating, particularly at a current density of 1 \u00d7 107 A/cm2; however, self-heating considerations cannot account for the entire improvement unless unusually large activation energies for grain boundary diffusion are assumed. The cause of the remainder of the improvement (not accounted for by self-heating) has not been determined; however, excess vacancy concentration, and its dependence on duty factor, may contribute to the lifetime improvement.","doi":"10.1109/IRPS.1978.362853","displayPublicationTitle":"16th International Reliability Physics Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/4208193/4208194/04208243.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4208194","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IRPS.1978.362853","publicationTitle":"16th International Reliability Physics Symposium","startPage":"241","endPage":"247","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Electromigration Failure Under Pulse Test Conditions","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4208243","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  1978","displayDocTitle":"Electromigration Failure Under Pulse Test Conditions","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4208243/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 1978","dateOfInsertion":"21 May 2007","conferenceDate":"18-20 April 1978","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Electromigration Failure Under Pulse Test Conditions","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"IRPS-00-49.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.028565S","chronDate":"April  1978","isNumber":"4208194","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4208193","citationCount":"15","articleId":"4208243","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1978","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-28"},{"_id":4208256,"authors":[{"name":"Dwight L.

The memory chips were processed using essentially standard PMOS silicon gate, aluminum metal technology, but with Ti-Pt-Au beam leads applied for packaging in a 22-pin, 4-chip, ceramic substrate DIP. Major failure mechanisms exhibited by the 47 chips failing during the 20,000-hour field study included gate oxide shorts, hot-electron charging of gates left floating by missing contact windows (unique to the process used for these particular devices) and parasitic MOS transistors due to thinned field dielectric. Other failures were due to various anomolous defects. Characteristics of the failure mechanisms are discussed in some detail. Failure rates beyond the 20,000-hour point are predicted by fitting several distribution models to the data. The lognormal, logarithmic extreme value and Weibull distributions all fit the data quite well, particularly when the estimate of faulty subpopulation size for each failure mechanism is optimized. Treating the failure mechanisms independently results in prediction of lower long-term failure rates than similar treatment of all failures combined. Cumulative chip failure rate through 20,000 hours was 110 FITs, and the average failure rate between 10,000 and 20,000 hours was 37 FITs. Instantaneous failure rate is projected to be less than 10 FITs after five years of field operation.","doi":"10.1109/IRPS.1979.362896","publicationTitle":"17th International Reliability Physics Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"17th International Reliability Physics Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/4208249/4208250/04208289.pdf","startPage":"213","endPage":"219","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4208250","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IRPS.1979.362896","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"PMOS Dynamic RAM Reliability = A Case Study","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4208289/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  1979","displayDocTitle":"PMOS Dynamic RAM Reliability = A Case Study","dateOfInsertion":"21 May 2007","publicationDate":"April 1979","conferenceDate":"24-26 April 1979","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"PMOS Dynamic RAM Reliability = A Case Study","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"IRPS-00-39.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.038697S","chronDate":"April  1979","isNumber":"4208250","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4208249","citationCount":"6","articleId":"4208289","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1979","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4208343,"authors":[{"name":"R.

The saturation mode threshold has been observed to drift as much as -0.5V when the MOSFET is operating with high drain voltage. Through a series of experiments it is concluded that this instability is due to a chemical effect associated with hydrogen in the nitride films. The formation of surface states and fixed charges in the channel region due to the-interaction of hot carriers with hydrogen present at the interface is proposed to be the basic mechanism. Experimental results with respect to voltage, time and device geometry, will be discussed.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Effects of Silicon Nitride Encapsulation on MOS Device Stability","publicationTitle":"18th International Reliability Physics Symposium","doi":"10.1109/IRPS.1980.362948","displayPublicationTitle":"18th International Reliability Physics Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/4208295/4208296/04208344.pdf","startPage":"244","endPage":"251","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IRPS.1980.362948","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4208296","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4208344","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4208344/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 April 1980","displayDocTitle":"Effects of Silicon Nitride Encapsulation on MOS Device Stability","conferenceDate":"8-10 April 1980","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"21 May 2007","publicationDate":"April 1980","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Effects of Silicon Nitride Encapsulation on MOS Device Stability","confLoc":"Las Vegas, NV, USA","sourcePdf":"IRPS-00-48.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065793S","chronDate":"8-10 April 1980","isNumber":"4208296","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4208295","citationCount":"19","articleId":"4208344","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1980","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4208347,"authors":[{"name":"R.

We have run computer calculations using the finite element method, in parallel with experimental work. When an alpha particle penetrates a pn-junction, the generated carriers drastically distort the junction field. After alpha particle penetration, the field, which was originally limited to the depletion region, extends far down into the bulk silicon along the length of the alpha-particle track and funnels a large number of carriers into the struck junction. After less than one nanosecond, the field recovers to its position in the normal depletion layer, and, if the track is long enough, a residue of carriers is left to be transported by diffusion. The extent of this field funneling is a function of substrate concentration, bias voltage, and the alpha-particle energy.","doi":"10.1109/IRPS.1981.362970","publicationTitle":"19th International Reliability Physics Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"19th International Reliability Physics Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/4208357/4208358/04208369.pdf","startPage":"38","endPage":"42","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IRPS.1981.362970","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4208358","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dynamics of Charge Collection from Alpha-Particle Tracks in Integrated Circuits","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","conferenceDate":"7-9 April 1981","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4208369/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  1981","displayDocTitle":"Dynamics of Charge Collection from Alpha-Particle Tracks in Integrated Circuits","dateOfInsertion":"21 May 2007","publicationDate":"April 1981","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamics of Charge Collection from Alpha-Particle Tracks in Integrated Circuits","confLoc":"Las Vegas, NV, USA","sourcePdf":"IRPS-00-11.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.02622S","chronDate":"April  1981","isNumber":"4208358","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4208357","citationCount":"41","articleId":"4208369","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1981","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":4208396,"authors":[{"name":"Arnold Berman","affiliation":["General Technology Division, IBM, Hopewell Junction, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Arnold","lastName":"Berman","id":"37700168800"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0735-0791"}],"articleNumber":"4208396","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":88,"citationCountPatent":5,"totalDownloads":1212},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Life testing","Dielectric breakdown","Histograms","Temperature dependence","Life estimation","Breakdown voltage","Laboratories","Dielectric measurements","Temperature distribution","Accelerometers"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4208396","abstract":"Using a long-established feature of time dependent dielectric breakdown (TDDB) it is demonstrated that a ramped voltage breakdown histogram of a sample population can be used to accurately forecast the rate of breakdown failures in the field. It is shown that such a histogram can be interpreted as the field dependence of failure at constant time. The tamp-TDDB relationship involves no fitting parameters and only a single material-related parameter. The temperature dependence of this parameter is established for SiO2 Extensive ramp-life test measurements have verified the relationship experimentally. It is argued that the usual models used to relate laboratory life tests to reliability failures are inherently faulty. The faults stem from the temperature dependence and the distributions of failure times, both of which must be assumed in order to extrapolate accelerated life tests to use conditions. On the other hand the actual distribution is measured in a ramp test and the temperature acceleration is not needed. This finding has far-reaching implications for reliability assessment. Dielectric life tests can be replaced by the relatively simple and rapid ramp test with increased confidence in projection. From the analysis it is shown that the effect on reliability of a high field screen can be quantitatively determined in an absolute manner.","doi":"10.1109/IRPS.1981.362997","startPage":"204","endPage":"209","publicationTitle":"19th International Reliability Physics Symposium","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IRPS.1981.362997","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4208358","displayPublicationTitle":"19th International Reliability Physics Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/4208357/4208358/04208396.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Time-Zero Dielectric Reliability Test by a Ramp Method","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4208396/","displayDocTitle":"Time-Zero Dielectric Reliability Test by a Ramp Method","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 1981","dateOfInsertion":"21 May 2007","conferenceDate":"7-9 April 1981","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  1981","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Time-Zero Dielectric Reliability Test by a Ramp Method","confLoc":"Las Vegas, NV, USA","sourcePdf":"IRPS-00-38.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.023929S","chronDate":"April  1981","isNumber":"4208358","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4208357","citationCount":"88","articleId":"4208396","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1981","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4208454,"authors":[{"name":"Joseph R.

Unlike a typical gate oxide breakdown which is caused by a voltage stress on the gate, this failure mode is caused by a source-drain bipolar current resulting from the snapback action. This failure mode results in a gate-to-drain short, and was found to require a minimum critical current, Idcrit, after the transistor goes in the snapback. The failure node is exhibited in the input protection structures used in an MOS circuit. The incidence of the failure mode increased with increasing grading of the source-drain junction.

In this paper observed DRAM degradation with stress is related to the actual transistor level degradation. It is shown here that the transistor saturation drain current is a good monitor of the DRAM Access Time, while the Precharge Time and the Refresh Time can be related respectively to degradations in the transistor's linear drive current and the saturation region subthreshold current. As concluded in this paper, transistor parameters other than just Vt and gm need to be monitored with hot carrier stress to understand the full impact on DRAM circuit functionality.","doi":"10.1109/IRPS.1987.362179","publicationTitle":"25th International Reliability Physics Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"25th International Reliability Physics Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/4208675/4208676/04208713.pdf","startPage":"201","endPage":"206","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4208676","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IRPS.1987.362179","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Impact of Hot Carriers on Dram Circuits","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4208713/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  1987","displayDocTitle":"Impact of Hot Carriers on Dram Circuits","dateOfInsertion":"21 May 2007","publicationDate":"April 1987","conferenceDate":"7-9 April 1987","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Impact of Hot Carriers on Dram Circuits","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"IRPS-00-37.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.026058S","chronDate":"April  1987","isNumber":"4208676","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4208675","citationCount":"12","articleId":"4208713","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1987","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4208714,"authors":[{"name":"E.

Recently, the FPGA industry (e.g. Xilinx, Altera) recognized the dominance of the heat problem as one of its key design issues, which should be tackled immediately. In this paper, considering a novel temperature-aware placement and routing algorithm, a systematic methodology to achieve a more \"balanced\" temperature distribution in the whole FPGA device, is introduced. Since the temperature is straightforward-related with the FPGA hardware resources switching activity, the main goal of the proposed methodology is to manipulate appropriately the switching activity appeared on different regions of the FPGA. Using the temperature-aware algorithm, we redistribute the switching activity over the FPGA resources, resulting into a rather \"balanced\" profile. Comparing with a conventionally-placed and routed FPGA (e.g. VPR), we proved that up to 33% temperature reduction in hotspots can be achieved with negligible side effects in circuit delay, energy/power consumption and silicon area.

In order to exploit several different topologies, a place and route framework, able to deal with such vast design exploration space, is of paramount importance. Bearing this in mind, this paper proposes a placement scheme able to target different topologies when considering data-driven reconfigurable architectures. Our approach uses graph models for the target architecture and for the dataflow representation of the application being mapped.

The proposed memory cell (MC) has ten transistors (10T), comprised of the conventional 6T MC, a readout inverter and a transmission gate for a read port. Since the readout inverter fully charges/discharges a read bitline, there is no precharge circuit on the read bitline. Thus, power is not consumed by precharging, but is consumed only when a readout datum is changed. This feature is suitable to video processing since image data have special correlation and similar data are read out in consecutive cycles. As well as the power reduction, the precharge-less structure shortens a cycle time by 38% compared with the conventional SRAM, because it does not require a precharge period. This, in turn, demonstrates that the proposed SRAM operates at a lower voltage, which achieves further power reduction. Compared to the conventional 8T SRAM, the proposed SRAM reduces a charge/discharge possibility to 19% (81% reduction) on the bitlines, and saves 74% of a readout power when considered as an H.264 reconstructed-image memory. The area overhead is 14.4% in a 90-nm process technology.","doi":"10.1109/ISVLSI.2007.2","publicationTitle":"IEEE Computer Society Annual Symposium on VLSI (ISVLSI '07)","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Computer Society Annual Symposium on VLSI (ISVLSI '07)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4208876/4208877/04208902.pdf","startPage":"107","endPage":"112","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISVLSI.2007.2","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4208877","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A 10T Non-Precharge Two-Port SRAM for 74% Power Reduction in Video Processing","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4208902/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-11 March 2007","displayDocTitle":"A 10T Non-Precharge Two-Port SRAM for 74% Power Reduction in Video Processing","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"March 2007","accessionNumber":"9518509","htmlLink":"/document/4208902/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"21 May 2007","conferenceDate":"9-11 March 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A 10T Non-Precharge Two-Port SRAM for 74% Power Reduction in Video Processing","confLoc":"Porto Alegre, Brazil","sourcePdf":"28960107.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.083592S","chronDate":"9-11 March 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4208876","isNumber":"4208877","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4208876","citationCount":"38","xplore-issue":"4208877","articleId":"4208902","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4208907,"authors":[{"name":"Arthur Nieuwoudt","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Rice University, Houston, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Arthur","lastName":"Nieuwoudt","id":"37299372300"},{"name":"Tamer Ragheb","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Rice University, Houston, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Tamer","lastName":"Ragheb","id":"37299375200"},{"name":"Yehia Massoud","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Rice University, Houston, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Yehia","lastName":"Massoud","id":"37299387500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7695-2896-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2159-3469"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2159-3477"}],"articleNumber":"4208907","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":26,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":225},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4208907","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Design optimization","Low-noise amplifiers","Frequency","Impedance matching","Switches","Circuit topology","Manuals","Energy consumption","Design methodology","Computer architecture"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["low noise amplifiers","network synthesis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["systematic design optimization methodology","multiband CMOS low noise amplifiers","multistandard wireless receivers","impedance matching","gain","power dissipation requirements","multiband LNA designs"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we develop a systematic design optimization methodology for switchable multi-band CMOS low noise amplifiers (LNA) in fully integrated multi-standard wireless receivers.

First of all, the selection procedure chooses prospective parent circuits for mating on the basis of comparable fitness values. Secondly, the crossover process comprises of exchanging well-defined subcircuits, encompassing the whole design space, between the two chosen parent circuits. This minimizes the production of faulty offspring circuits. Experiments conducted on two filter specifications show that the techniques adopted bring about a reduction in the search space and help in faster attainment of the design goal.","doi":"10.1109/ISVLSI.2007.22","startPage":"145","endPage":"152","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Computer Society Annual Symposium on VLSI (ISVLSI '07)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4208876/4208877/04208908.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Computer Society Annual Symposium on VLSI (ISVLSI '07)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISVLSI.2007.22","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4208877","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Automated Passive Analog Circuit Synthesis Framework using Genetic Algorithms","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Analog circuits","Circuit synthesis","Genetic algorithms","RLC circuits","Circuit topology","Genetic programming","Filters","Production","Computational modeling","Circuit simulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["analogue circuits","genetic algorithms","network synthesis","passive networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["automated passive analog circuit synthesis framework","genetic algorithms"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4208908/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-11 March 2007","displayDocTitle":"An Automated Passive Analog Circuit Synthesis Framework using Genetic Algorithms","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4208908/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2007","dateOfInsertion":"21 May 2007","conferenceDate":"9-11 March 2007","accessionNumber":"9518516","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Automated Passive Analog Circuit Synthesis Framework using Genetic Algorithms","confLoc":"Porto Alegre, Brazil","sourcePdf":"28960145.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045238S","chronDate":"9-11 March 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4208876","isNumber":"4208877","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4208876","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"4208877","articleId":"4208908","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4208915,"authors":[{"name":"Tiago R.

Some FPAA models are based on SRAM memory cells to implement the user programmability. For this reason, such kind of device becomes vulnerable to SEU when employed in applications susceptible to the incidence of electrical charged particles. In the former part of this work some fault injection experiments are made in order to investigate the effects of SEU in the SRAM blocks of a commercial FPAA. For this purpose, single bit inversions are injected in the FPAA programming bit-stream. In a second moment, a self-recovering scheme using the studied FPAA is proposed. This scheme is able to restore the original programming data if an error is detected. The error detection circuit is built using the internal programming resources of the FPAA and a very simple external logic.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Computer Society Annual Symposium on VLSI (ISVLSI '07)","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Computer Society Annual Symposium on VLSI (ISVLSI '07)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4208876/4208877/04208915.pdf","startPage":"192","endPage":"197","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Single Event Upset in SRAM-based Field Programmable Analog Arrays: Effects and Mitigation","doi":"10.1109/ISVLSI.2007.91","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4208877","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISVLSI.2007.91","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4208915","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4208915/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-11 March 2007","displayDocTitle":"Single Event Upset in SRAM-based Field Programmable Analog Arrays: Effects and Mitigation","dateOfInsertion":"21 May 2007","publicationDate":"March 2007","accessionNumber":"9518527","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"9-11 March 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4208915/","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Single Event Upset in SRAM-based Field Programmable Analog Arrays: Effects and Mitigation","confLoc":"Porto Alegre, Brazil","sourcePdf":"28960192.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053168S","chronDate":"9-11 March 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4208876","isNumber":"4208877","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4208876","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4208877","articleId":"4208915","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4208930,"authors":[{"name":"Shubhankar Basu","affiliation":["Department of ECE, University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, OH, USA"],"firstName":"Shubhankar","lastName":"Basu","id":"37287177100"},{"name":"Ranga Vemuri","affiliation":["Department of ECE, University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, OH, USA"],"firstName":"Ranga","lastName":"Vemuri","id":"37274865900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7695-2896-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2159-3469"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2159-3477"}],"articleNumber":"4208930","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":11,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":346},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Niobium compounds","Titanium compounds","Robustness","Negative bias temperature instability","MOSFETs","Application specific integrated circuits","Design methodology","Design optimization","Delay effects","Timing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["application specific integrated circuits","delays","integrated circuit design","integrated circuit modelling","integrated circuit reliability","integrated circuit yield","MOSFET"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["application specific integrated circuits","ASIC","negative bias temperature instability","yield improvement","PMOS transistors","sea-of-gate design","intrinsic gate delay"]}],"abstract":"Negative bias temperature instability (NBTI) has become a growing concern in nanometer technologies. It may reduce the lifetime of reliable operation of PMOS transistors in the design. Process variation has started impacting the nanometer ICs by reducing the parametric yield. Process variation together with NBTI can further reduce the reliable lifetime of ICs. Conventional ASIC design methodology uses pre-characterized standard cells to optimize the design as per specifications. The standard cells occupy nearly 75% of the chip real estate in a sea-of-gate design. Therefore process variation and NBTI tolerant robust standard cells may help in reducing the margin of performance variation thereby increasing the lifetime of reliable operation. The use of robust cells may further help in reducing the design time overhead. In this work, the authors model the combined effect of process variation and NBTI on intrinsic gate delay using a reduced dimension modeling technique. The authors use the models to optimize the standard cells in the presence of NBTI and process variations with a target lifetime of 10 years. Experimental results show that the use of optimized robust standard cells can considerably improve the tolerance of circuit in the self-timed sections of critical timing paths.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Process Variation and NBTI Tolerant Standard Cells to Improve Parametric Yield and Lifetime of ICs","publicationTitle":"IEEE Computer Society Annual Symposium on VLSI (ISVLSI '07)","doi":"10.1109/ISVLSI.2007.85","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Computer Society Annual Symposium on VLSI (ISVLSI '07)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4208876/4208877/04208930.pdf","startPage":"291","endPage":"298","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISVLSI.2007.85","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4208877","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4208930","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4208930/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-11 March 2007","displayDocTitle":"Process Variation and NBTI Tolerant Standard Cells to Improve Parametric Yield and Lifetime of ICs","conferenceDate":"9-11 March 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4208930/","dateOfInsertion":"21 May 2007","publicationDate":"March 2007","accessionNumber":"9518567","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Process Variation and NBTI Tolerant Standard Cells to Improve Parametric Yield and Lifetime of ICs","confLoc":"Porto Alegre, Brazil","sourcePdf":"28960291.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.109594S","chronDate":"9-11 March 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4208876","isNumber":"4208877","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4208876","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"4208877","articleId":"4208930","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4208932,"authors":[{"name":"Brett Feero","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering & Computer Science, Washington State University, Pullman, WA, USA"],"firstName":"Brett","lastName":"Feero","id":"37688883400"},{"name":"Partha Pratim Pande","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering & Computer Science, Washington State University, Pullman, WA, USA"],"firstName":"Partha Pratim","lastName":"Pande","id":"37282777300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7695-2896-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2159-3469"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2159-3477"}],"articleNumber":"4208932","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":39,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":366},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Network-on-a-chip","Integrated circuit interconnections","Delay","Power system interconnection","Three-dimensional integrated circuits","Packaging","Telecommunication traffic","Traffic control","Network topology","Computer science"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["embedded systems","integrated circuit testing","network-on-chip","performance evaluation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["performance evaluation","3D network-on-chip","3D integrated circuits","area overhead","packaging density","embedded cores"]}],"abstract":"Three dimensional (3D) integrated circuits (ICs) are capable of achieving better performance, functionality, and packaging density compared to more traditional planar ICs.

The bi-dimensional discrete cosine transformation (2D-DCT) is a commonly used frequency transformation in graphic compression algorithms. Many hardware implementations, adopting disparate algorithms, have been proposed for field programmable gate arrays (FPGA). These designs focus either on performance or area, and often do not succeed in balancing the two aspects. In this paper, we present a design of a fast 2D-DCT hardware accelerator for a FPGA-based SoC. This accelerator makes use of a single seven stages 1D-DCT pipeline able to alternate computation for the even and odd coefficients in every cycle. In addition, it uses special memories to perform the transpose operations. Our hardware takes 80 clock cycles at 107MHz to generate a complete 8times8 2D DCT, from the writing of the first input sample to the reading of the last result (including the overhead of the interface logic). We show that this architecture provides optimal performance/area ratio with respect to several alternative designs.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Computer Society Annual Symposium on VLSI (ISVLSI '07)","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Computer Society Annual Symposium on VLSI (ISVLSI '07)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4208876/4208877/04208936.pdf","startPage":"331","endPage":"336","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Pipelined Fast 2D-DCT Accelerator for FPGA-based SoCs","doi":"10.1109/ISVLSI.2007.13","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4208877","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISVLSI.2007.13","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4208936","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4208936/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-11 March 2007","displayDocTitle":"A Pipelined Fast 2D-DCT Accelerator for FPGA-based SoCs","dateOfInsertion":"21 May 2007","publicationDate":"March 2007","accessionNumber":"9518569","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"9-11 March 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4208936/","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Pipelined Fast 2D-DCT Accelerator for FPGA-based SoCs","confLoc":"Porto Alegre, Brazil","sourcePdf":"28960331.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.093802S","chronDate":"9-11 March 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4208876","isNumber":"4208877","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4208876","citationCount":"27","xplore-issue":"4208877","articleId":"4208936","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4208937,"authors":[{"name":"James E.

In this paper, a new architecture for efficient 1-digit decimal addition of binary coded decimal (BCD) operands, which is the core of high speed multi-operand adders and floating decimal-point arithmetic, is proposed. Based on this 1-digit BCD adder, novel architectures for higher order (n-digit) BCD adders such as ripple carry adder and carry look-ahead adder are derived. The proposed circuits are compared (both qualitatively as well as quantitatively) with the existing circuits in literature and are shown to perform better. Simulation results show that the proposed 1-digit BCD adder achieves an improvement of 40% in delay. The 16-digit BCD look-ahead adder using prefix logic is shown to perform at least 80% faster than the existing ripple carry one.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Novel, High-Speed 16-Digit BCD Adders Conforming to IEEE 754r Format","publicationTitle":"IEEE Computer Society Annual Symposium on VLSI (ISVLSI '07)","doi":"10.1109/ISVLSI.2007.71","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Computer Society Annual Symposium on VLSI (ISVLSI '07)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4208876/4208877/04208938.pdf","startPage":"343","endPage":"350","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISVLSI.2007.71","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4208877","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4208938","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4208938/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-11 March 2007","displayDocTitle":"Novel, High-Speed 16-Digit BCD Adders Conforming to IEEE 754r Format","conferenceDate":"9-11 March 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4208938/","dateOfInsertion":"21 May 2007","publicationDate":"March 2007","accessionNumber":"9518570","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Novel, High-Speed 16-Digit BCD Adders Conforming to IEEE 754r Format","confLoc":"Porto Alegre, Brazil","sourcePdf":"28960343.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042235S","chronDate":"9-11 March 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4208876","isNumber":"4208877","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4208876","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"4208877","articleId":"4208938","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4208954,"authors":[{"name":"Bruno Zatt","affiliation":["Microelectronics Group (GME), UFRGS, Porto Alegre, Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil"],"firstName":"Bruno","lastName":"Zatt","id":"37295620700"},{"name":"Arnaldo Azevedo","affiliation":["Microelectronics Group (GME), UFRGS, Porto Alegre, Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil"],"firstName":"Arnaldo","lastName":"Azevedo","id":"37302371600"},{"name":"Luciano Agostini","affiliation":["Microelectronics Group (GME), UFRGS, Porto Alegre, Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil"],"firstName":"Luciano","lastName":"Agostini","id":"37300469400"},{"name":"Altamiro Susin","affiliation":["Microelectronics Group (GME), UFRGS, Porto Alegre, Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil"],"firstName":"Altamiro","lastName":"Susin","id":"37277769300"},{"name":"Sergio Bampi","affiliation":["Microelectronics Group (GME), UFRGS, Porto Alegre, Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil"],"firstName":"Sergio","lastName":"Bampi","id":"37265059600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7695-2896-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2159-3469"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2159-3477"}],"articleNumber":"4208954","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":11,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":99},"abstract":"This paper presents a motion compensation memory hierarchy for an H.264/AVC decoder with support to bi-predictive frames.

For micronets, tight coupling between processor microarchitecture and network architecture is one of the keys to improving processor performance. This paper presents the design, implementation and evaluation of the TRIPS operand network (OPN). The TRIPS OPN is a 5times5, dynamically routed, 2D mesh micronet that is integrated into the TRIPS microprocessor core. The TRIPS OPN is used for operand passing, register file I/O, and primary memory system I/O. We discuss in detail the OPN design, including the unique features that arise from its integration with the processor core, such as its connection to the execution unit's wakeup pipeline and its in flight mis-speculated traffic removal. We then evaluate the performance of the network under synthetic and realistic loads.

Its throughput, maximum frequency, and area are evaluated in function of the FIFO depth.","doi":"10.1109/NOCS.2007.14","publicationTitle":"First International Symposium on Networks-on-Chip (NOCS'07)","displayPublicationTitle":"First International Symposium on Networks-on-Chip (NOCS'07)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4208981/4208982/04208997.pdf","startPage":"83","endPage":"94","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NOCS.2007.14","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4208982","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Bi-Synchronous FIFO for Synchronous Circuit Communication Well Suited for Network-on-Chip in GALS Architectures","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4208997","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-9 May 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4208997/","displayDocTitle":"Bi-Synchronous FIFO for Synchronous Circuit Communication Well Suited for Network-on-Chip in GALS Architectures","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2007","accessionNumber":"9498387","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4208997/","conferenceDate":"7-9 May 2007","dateOfInsertion":"21 May 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Bi-Synchronous FIFO for Synchronous Circuit Communication Well Suited for Network-on-Chip in GALS Architectures","confLoc":"Princeton, NJ, USA","sourcePdf":"27730083.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059918S","chronDate":"7-9 May 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4208981","isNumber":"4208982","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4208981","citationCount":"68","xplore-issue":"4208982","articleId":"4208997","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4209004,"authors":[{"name":"George Michelogiannakis","affiliation":["Institute of Computer Science, Foundation for Research and Technology Hellas, Crete, Greece"],"firstName":"George","lastName":"Michelogiannakis","id":"37540629500"},{"name":"Dionisios Pnevmatikatos","affiliation":["Department of Electronic and Computer Engineering, Technical University of Crete, Crete, Greece"],"firstName":"Dionisios","lastName":"Pnevmatikatos","id":"37265760300"},{"name":"Manolis Katevenis","affiliation":["Institute of Computer Science, Foundation for Research and Technology Hellas, Crete, Greece"],"firstName":"Manolis","lastName":"Katevenis","id":"37269335400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7695-2773-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4209004","dbTime":"15 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":35,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":284},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Network-on-a-chip","Delay","Engines","Clocks","Wire","Runtime","Computer networks","Topology","Routing","System recovery"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["logic design","microprocessor chips","network routing","network-on-chip"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["NoC latency design","pre-configured routes","multicore ASIC","network-on-chip","mad-postman technique","pre-enabled tri-state driver","2D mesh topology","processor-memory communication"]}],"abstract":"In multi-core ASICs, processors and other compute engines need to communicate with memory blocks and other cores with latency as close as possible to the ideal of a direct buffered wire. However, current state of the art networks-on-chip (NoCs) suffer, at best, latency of one clock cycle per hop. We investigate the design of a NoC that offers close to the ideal latency in some preferred, run-time configurable paths. Processors and other compute engines may perform network reconfiguration to guarantee low latency over different sets of paths as needed. Flits in non-preferred paths are given lower priority than flits in preferred ones, and suffer a delay of one clock cycle per hop when there is no contention. To achieve our goal, we use the \"mad-postman\" technique: every incoming flit is eagerly (i.e. speculatively) forwarded to the input's preferred output, if any. This is accomplished with the mere delay of a single pre-enabled tri-state driver. We later check if that decision was correct, and if not, we forward the flit to the proper output. Incorrectly forwarded flits are classified as dead and eliminated in later hops. We use a 2D mesh topology tailored for processor-memory communication, and a modified version of XY routing that remains deadlock-free. Performance gains are significant and can be proven greatly useful in other application domains as well","doi":"10.1109/NOCS.2007.10","publicationTitle":"First International Symposium on Networks-on-Chip (NOCS'07)","displayPublicationTitle":"First International Symposium on Networks-on-Chip (NOCS'07)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4208981/4208982/04209004.pdf","startPage":"153","endPage":"162","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NOCS.2007.10","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4208982","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Approaching Ideal NoC Latency with Pre-Configured Routes","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4209004","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-9 May 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4209004/","displayDocTitle":"Approaching Ideal NoC Latency with Pre-Configured Routes","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2007","accessionNumber":"9498394","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4209004/","conferenceDate":"7-9 May 2007","dateOfInsertion":"21 May 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Approaching Ideal NoC Latency with Pre-Configured Routes","confLoc":"Princeton, NJ, USA","sourcePdf":"27730153.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.040688S","chronDate":"7-9 May 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4208981","isNumber":"4208982","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4208981","citationCount":"35","xplore-issue":"4208982","articleId":"4209004","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4209005,"authors":[{"name":"Arnab Banerjee","affiliation":["Computer Laboratory, University of Cambridge, UK"],"firstName":"Arnab","lastName":"Banerjee","id":"37307211500"},{"name":"Robert Mullins","affiliation":["Computer Laboratory, University of Cambridge, UK"],"firstName":"Robert","lastName":"Mullins","id":"37282357100"},{"name":"Simon Moore","affiliation":["Computer Laboratory, University of Cambridge, UK"],"firstName":"Simon","lastName":"Moore","id":"37276662100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7695-2773-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4209005","dbTime":"16 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":52,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":504},"abstract":"In this study, we analyse the move towards networks-on-chips from an energy perspective by accurately modelling a circuit-switched router, a wormhole router and a speculative virtual-channel router in a 90nm CMOS process. All the routers are shown to dissipate significant idle state power. The additional energy required to route a packet through the router is then shown to be dominated by the data-path. This leads to the key result that, if this trend continues, the energy cost of more elaborate control would not be vast, making it easier to justify. Given effective clock-gating, this additional energy is also shown to be more or less independent of network congestion.

A disadvantage of the mesh topology is in its large communication radius. By partitioning a two-dimensional mesh into several sub-meshes and connecting them using a global interconnect, we can reduce the average number of hops for global traffic. This paper presents a hybrid architecture that partitions a large 2D-mesh into several smaller sub-meshes which are globally connected using a hierarchical ring interconnect. Hierarchical rings have been selected for study because of their simplicity, speed and efficiency in embedding onto a circuit layout, as well as for their suitability for efficient cache coherent protocols.

Temporal and spatial thermal variations were addressed in 65 nm, 45 nm and 32 nm interconnect circuits. Standard repeater insertion and differential current sensing techniques have been implemented. The circuits were analyzed in temperatures as high as 150degC for the temporal variations, with a maximum temperature difference through wire of up to 50degC. High temperature caused more delay and power overhead in smaller technologies, i.e. 45 nm and 32 nm, by as much as 71% at 150degC for a given wirelength of 3 mm in 32 nm. Spatial temperature distribution profile influenced the propagation delay by 14.7% for a maximum thermal gradient of 50degC in the worst case for a 32 nm, 3 mm repeated wire.

A key challenge for FPGA design is supporting numerous highly variable design instances with good performance and low cost. Our architecture minimizes the cost of supporting a wide range of design instances with given throughput requirements by balancing the amount of efficient hard-coded NoC infrastructure and the allocation of \"soft\" networking resources at configuration time. Although traffic patterns are design-specific, the physical link infrastructure is a performance bottleneck, and hence should be hard-coded. It is therefore important to employ routing schemes that allow for high flexibility to efficiently accommodate different traffic patterns during configuration. We examine the required capacity allocation for supporting a collection of typical traffic patterns on such chips under a number of routing schemes. We propose a new routing scheme, weighted ordered toggle (WOT), and show that it allows high design flexibility with low infrastructure cost.

However, extensive simulation of the NoC architecture with cycle and bit accuracy is prohibitively time consuming. In this paper we describe a simulation method to simulate large parallel homogeneous and heterogeneous network-on-chips on a single FPGA. The method is especially suitable for parallel systems where lengthy cycle and bit accurate simulations are required. As a case study, we use a NoC that was modelled and simulated in SystemC. We simulate the same NoC on the described FPGA simulator. This enables us to observe the NoC behavior under a large variety of traffic patterns.

It has been recently proposed that the most efficient way to monitor the ocean is through networks of small, intelligent and cheap robotic platforms. Drifting profiling floats and gliders were developed in this context. Floats move with the currents meanwhile they periodically sample the water column through controlled immersions. Conversely, gliders are underwater autonomous vehicles with controllable motion at sea. Both platforms are extensively employed in oceanography due to their high autonomy. A network called Argo of around 3000 profiling floats spreads out around the world's ocean. Glider networks are starting to settle down at smaller scale in different places. The advent of these networks and the still scarce resources for ocean sampling, create a demand for quantitative tools for optimizing their use. In this work, the problem of optimally merging networks of profiling floats and gliders is considered. Specifically, a genetic algorithm is employed to find optimal glider trajectories to get together an unevenly distributed network of floats the best quality of the sampled field. A measure of the quality of the oceanographic field (objective function to minimize) is defined in terms of the mean formal error obtained from an optimum interpolation scheme. Results show that the quality of the sampled field can be greatly improved by merging both networks if the resolution of glider observations is adequately selected. The spatial lag between glider observations is related to the geometry of the network of profiling floats and must be order of the grid spacing obtained from the mean data spacing of the network of floats.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4209085/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-14 April 2007","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"10-14 April 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4209085/","dateOfInsertion":"21 May 2007","publicationDate":"April 2007","accessionNumber":"10285918","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Combining networks of drifting profiling floats and gliders for adaptive sampling of the Ocean","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Combining networks of drifting profiling floats and gliders for adaptive sampling of the Ocean","confLoc":"Rome, Italy","sourcePdf":"ROBOT-00-36.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.040618S","chronDate":"10-14 April 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4209048","isNumber":"4209049","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4209048","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"4209049","articleId":"4209085","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4209102,"authors":[{"name":"Auke Jan Ijspeert","affiliation":["School of Computer and Communication Sciences, Ecole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Auke Jan","lastName":"Ijspeert","id":"37268732300"},{"name":"Alessandro Crespi","affiliation":["School of Computer and Communication Sciences, Ecole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Alessandro","lastName":"Crespi","id":"37549686700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0602-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0601-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1050-4729"}],"articleNumber":"4209102","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":78,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1177},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Robot kinematics","Centralized control","Limit-cycles","Spinal cord","Coupling circuits","Oscillators","Robust control","Closed-form solution","Frequency","Amplitude modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mobile robots","motion control","position control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["online trajectory generation","amphibious snake robot","lamprey-like central pattern generator model","swimming locomotion","serpentine locomotion","neural circuits","coupled nonlinear oscillators"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4209102","doi":"10.1109/ROBOT.2007.363797","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ROBOT.2007.363797","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4209049","publicationTitle":"Proceedings 2007 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings 2007 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel5/4209048/4209049/04209102.pdf","startPage":"262","endPage":"268","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Online trajectory generation in an amphibious snake robot using a lamprey-like central pattern generator model","abstract":"This article presents a control architecture for controlling the locomotion of an amphibious snake/lamprey robot capable of swimming and serpentine locomotion. The control architecture is based on a central pattern generator (CPG) model inspired from the neural circuits controlling locomotion in the lamprey's spinal cord. The CPG model is implemented as a system of coupled nonlinear oscillators on board of the robot. The CPG generates coordinated travelling waves in real time while being interactively modulated by a human-operator. Interesting aspects of the CPG model include (1) that it exhibits limit cycle behavior (i.e. it produces stable rhythmic patterns that are robust against perturbations), (2) that the limit cycle behavior has a closed-form solution which provides explicit control over relevant characteristics such as frequency, amplitude and wavelength of the travelling waves, and (3) that the control parameters of the CPG can be continuously and interactively modulated by a human operator to offer high maneuverability. We demonstrate how the CPG allows one to easily adjust the speed and direction of locomotion both in water and on ground while ensuring that continuous and smooth setpoints are sent to the robot's actuated joints.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4209102/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-14 April 2007","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"10-14 April 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4209102/","dateOfInsertion":"21 May 2007","publicationDate":"April 2007","accessionNumber":"9538315","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Online trajectory generation in an amphibious snake robot using a lamprey-like central pattern generator model","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Online trajectory generation in an amphibious snake robot using a lamprey-like central pattern generator model","confLoc":"Rome, Italy","sourcePdf":"ROBOT-00-53.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073518S","chronDate":"10-14 April 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4209048","isNumber":"4209049","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4209048","citationCount":"78","xplore-issue":"4209049","articleId":"4209102","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4209118,"authors":[{"name":"Daniel Gurdan","affiliation":["CSAIL, MIT, Technical University Munich, Germany"],"firstName":"Daniel","lastName":"Gurdan","id":"37689764300"},{"name":"Jan Stumpf","affiliation":["CSAIL, MIT, Technical University Munich, Germany"],"firstName":"Jan","lastName":"Stumpf","id":"37698858600"},{"name":"Michael Achtelik","affiliation":["Technical University Munich, Germany"],"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Achtelik","id":"37588236400"},{"name":"Klaus-Michael Doth","affiliation":["University of Erlangen, Germany"],"firstName":"Klaus-Michael","lastName":"Doth","id":"37689764700"},{"name":"Gerd Hirzinger","affiliation":["German Aerospace Center, Oberpfaffenhofen, Institute of Robotics and Mechatronics, Germany"],"firstName":"Gerd","lastName":"Hirzinger","id":"37279677100"},{"name":"Daniela Rus","affiliation":["CSAIL-MIT Laboratory of Distributed Robotics"],"firstName":"Daniela","lastName":"Rus","id":"37279652300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0602-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0601-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1050-4729"}],"articleNumber":"4209118","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":152,"citationCountPatent":5,"totalDownloads":2176},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Energy efficiency","Robot control","Robustness","Frequency","Brushless DC motors","Navigation","Hardware","Uncertainty","Position control","Lighting control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["aerospace robotics","aircraft control","closed loop systems","mobile robots","navigation","position control","stability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["energy-efficient autonomous four-rotor flying robot","indoor navigation","outdoor navigation","position control","flight maneuver","brushless DC motors","1 kHz"]}],"abstract":"We describe an efficient, reliable, and robust four-rotor flying platform for indoor and outdoor navigation.

Chlorophyll-rich vegetation in particular is often not an obstacle to a capable off-road vehicle, and it has long been recognized in the satellite imaging community that a simple comparison of the red and near-infrared (NIR) reflectance of a material provides a reliable technique for measuring chlorophyll content in natural scenes. This paper evaluates the effectiveness of using this chlorophyll-detection technique to improve autonomous navigation in natural, off-road environments. We demonstrate through extensive experiments that this feature has properties complementary to the color and shape descriptors traditionally used for point cloud analysis, and show significant improvement in classification performance for tasks relevant to outdoor navigation. Results are shown from field testing onboard a robot operating in off-road terrain.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-14 April 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4209141/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9538379","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4209141/","publicationDate":"April 2007","dateOfInsertion":"21 May 2007","conferenceDate":"10-14 April 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Vegetation Detection for Driving in Complex Environments","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Vegetation Detection for Driving in Complex Environments","confLoc":"Rome, Italy","sourcePdf":"ROBOT-00-92.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042329S","chronDate":"10-14 April 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4209048","isNumber":"4209049","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4209048","citationCount":"48","xplore-issue":"4209049","articleId":"4209141","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4209151,"authors":[{"name":"Anna Petrovskaya","affiliation":["Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, Computer Science Department, University of Stanford, Stanford, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Anna","lastName":"Petrovskaya","id":"37696151000"},{"name":"Jaeheung Park","affiliation":["Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, Computer Science Department, University of Stanford, Stanford, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Jaeheung","lastName":"Park","id":"37281014000"},{"name":"Oussama Khatib","affiliation":["Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, Computer Science Department, University of Stanford, Stanford, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Oussama","lastName":"Khatib","id":"37283150000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0602-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0601-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1050-4729"}],"articleNumber":"4209151","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":25,"citationCountPatent":4,"totalDownloads":354},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Probabilistic Estimation of Whole Body Contacts for Multi-Contact Robot Control","abstract":"Today most robots interact with the surroundings only with their end-effectors.

In North America, prostate cancer accounts for over 300,000 new cases and 40,000 deaths each year and it is the second leading cause of cancer death in men. Low-dose Rate (LDR) brachytherapy is gaining interest as a viable treatment option for prostate cancer due to its low side effects and high benefits. The present manual approach for brachytherapy needle insertion and the inherent flexibility of the needles make it extremely difficult to achieve accurate and consistent dosimetry. In this paper, we present a new 5 degrees-of-freedom (DOF) manipulator capable of performing percutaneous needle insertion. The manipulator can perform orientation, insertion and rotation of the needle and linear motion of the plunger to drop radioactive seeds at targeted locations. The manipulator is an integral part of a system utilizing a mechanically rotated side-fire transducer to create 3D ultrasound images of the organ and utilizing 3D SLICER software to visualize those images. Experiments conducted in agar phantoms reveal an average RMS targeting error of 1.45mm at an average insertion depth of 75.78mm proving the feasibility and efficacy of the proposed robotic system for percutaneous needle insertion.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4209159/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-14 April 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2007","dateOfInsertion":"21 May 2007","accessionNumber":"9517488","htmlLink":"/document/4209159/","conferenceDate":"10-14 April 2007","displayDocTitle":"A Novel Manipulator for 3D Ultrasound Guided Percutaneous Needle Insertion","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Novel Manipulator for 3D Ultrasound Guided Percutaneous Needle Insertion","confLoc":"Rome, Italy","sourcePdf":"ROBOT-00-110.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053789S","chronDate":"10-14 April 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4209048","isNumber":"4209049","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4209048","citationCount":"30","xplore-issue":"4209049","articleId":"4209159","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4209160,"authors":[{"name":"Ben Mitchell","firstName":"Ben","lastName":"Mitchell","id":"37686074500"},{"name":"John Koo","firstName":"John","lastName":"Koo","id":"37689649700"},{"name":"Iulian Iordachita","firstName":"Iulian","lastName":"Iordachita","id":"37330620500"},{"name":"Peter Kazanzides","firstName":"Peter","lastName":"Kazanzides","id":"37375173500"},{"name":"Ankur Kapoor","firstName":"Ankur","lastName":"Kapoor","id":"37552999800"},{"name":"James Handa","firstName":"James","lastName":"Handa","id":"37568981400"},{"name":"Gregory Hager","firstName":"Gregory","lastName":"Hager","id":"37276163200"},{"name":"Russell Taylor","firstName":"Russell","lastName":"Taylor","id":"37277162900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0602-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0601-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1050-4729"}],"articleNumber":"4209160","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":90,"citationCountPatent":10,"totalDownloads":1041},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Retina","Surgery","Force control","Manipulators","Microsurgery","Robot sensing systems","Robot control","Force sensors","Veins","Testing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["eye","force control","force sensors","medical robotics","micromanipulators","position control","surgery"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["steady-hand manipulator","retinal microsurgery","force sensor","positional control","force scaling","wrist design","flexibility","ergonomics","safety requirements"]}],"abstract":"This paper describes the development and initial testing of a new and optimized version of a steady-hand manipulator for retinal microsurgery. In the steady-hand paradigm, the surgeon and the robot share control of a tool attached to the robot through a force sensor. The robot controller senses forces exerted by the operator on the tool and uses this information in various control modes to provide smooth, tremor-free, precise positional control and force scaling. The steady-hand manipulator reported here has been specifically designed with the unique constraints of retinal microsurgery in mind.

It is required to obtain positional and angular signals around 1,000 Hz to control a mechanical system. A vision sensor must obtain visual features of a target object, synchronizing its sampling rate to the sampling rate of the control. The CMOS+FPGA vision system has been proposed to realize 1,000 Hz visual feedback. Matched filter can compute the position of a target robustly against occlusion, change of illumination, and background texture but requires much computation time since it includes 2D Fourier transform of images. Thus, matched filter algorithm is implemented on the system so that the matched filter can be performed in realtime. First we briefly introduce the CMOS+FPGA vision system. Second, we summarize the algorithm of matched filter to describe the design of the circuit performing matched filter on an FPGA. Finally, we show the experimental results of planar motion tracking by matched filter implemented on the system.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Realtime and Robust Motion Tracking by Matched Filter on CMOS+FPGA Vision System","doi":"10.1109/ROBOT.2007.363082","startPage":"788","endPage":"793","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ROBOT.2007.363082","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4209049","publicationTitle":"Proceedings 2007 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings 2007 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel5/4209048/4209049/04209186.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4209186","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4209186/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-14 April 2007","displayDocTitle":"Realtime and Robust Motion Tracking by Matched Filter on CMOS+FPGA Vision System","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4209186/","dateOfInsertion":"21 May 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2007","accessionNumber":"9572179","conferenceDate":"10-14 April 2007","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Realtime and Robust Motion Tracking by Matched Filter on CMOS+FPGA Vision System","confLoc":"Rome, Italy","sourcePdf":"ROBOT-00-137.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.074765S","chronDate":"10-14 April 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4209048","isNumber":"4209049","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4209048","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4209049","articleId":"4209186","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4209196,"authors":[{"name":"Jeff Craighead","affiliation":["Institute for Safety, Security and Rescue Technology, University of South Florida, Tampa, FL, USA"],"firstName":"Jeff","lastName":"Craighead","id":"37300867600"},{"name":"Robin Murphy","affiliation":["Institute for Safety, Security and Rescue Technology, University of South Florida, Tampa, FL, USA"],"firstName":"Robin","lastName":"Murphy","id":"37273983600"},{"name":"Jenny Burke","affiliation":["Institute for Safety, Security and Rescue Technology, University of South Florida, Tampa, FL, USA"],"firstName":"Jenny","lastName":"Burke","id":"37273188700"},{"name":"Brian Goldiez","affiliation":["Institute for Simulation & Training, University of Central Florida, USA"],"firstName":"Brian","lastName":"Goldiez","id":"37373980200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0602-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0601-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1050-4729"}],"articleNumber":"4209196","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":91,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":2438},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Engines","Computational modeling","Land vehicles","Unmanned aerial vehicles","Road vehicles","Numerical simulation","Visualization","Aerospace simulation","Computer simulation","Physics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["aerospace robotics","computer based training","control engineering education","data visualisation","mobile robots","public domain software","remotely operated vehicles"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["open source software","unmanned vehicle simulators","computer based simulator","unmanned aerial vehicles","unmanned surface vehicles","unmanned subsurface vehicles","unmanned ground vehicles","game engine","data visualization","object interaction"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4209196","doi":"10.1109/ROBOT.2007.363092","publicationTitle":"Proceedings 2007 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","abstract":"This report presents a survey of computer based simulators for unmanned vehicles. The simulators examined cover a wide spectrum of vehicles including unmanned aerial vehicles, both full scale and micro size; unmanned surface and subsurface vehicles; and unmanned ground vehicles. The majority of simulators use simple numerical simulation and simplistic visualization using custom OpenGL code. An emerging trend is to used modified commercial game engines for physical simulation and visualization. The game engines that are commercially available today are capable of physical simulations providing basic physical properties and interactions between objects. Newer and/or specialized engines such as the flight simulator X-Plane or Ageia PhysX and Havok physics engines, are capable of simulating more complex physical interactions between objects. Researchers in need of a simulator have a choice of using game engines or available open source and commercially available simulators, allowing resources to be focused on research instead of building a new simulator. We conclude that it is no longer necessary to build a new simulator from scratch.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ROBOT.2007.363092","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4209049","startPage":"852","endPage":"857","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings 2007 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel5/4209048/4209049/04209196.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Survey of Commercial & Open Source Unmanned Vehicle Simulators","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4209196/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-14 April 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4209196/","displayDocTitle":"A Survey of Commercial & Open Source Unmanned Vehicle Simulators","conferenceDate":"10-14 April 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2007","accessionNumber":"9538194","dateOfInsertion":"21 May 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Survey of Commercial & Open Source Unmanned Vehicle Simulators","confLoc":"Rome, Italy","sourcePdf":"ROBOT-00-147.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055426S","chronDate":"10-14 April 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4209048","isNumber":"4209049","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4209048","citationCount":"91","xplore-issue":"4209049","articleId":"4209196","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4209209,"authors":[{"name":"Joseph M.

Recent results indicate that steerable needles may enhance targeting accuracy and allow needles to avoid obstacles along the path to the target. This work considers teleoperation of needles made of a superelastic alloy that steer through tissue using forces generated by the standard asymmetric bevel tip. The needle may be modeled as a nonholonomic system, with inputs of insertion along and spin about the needle axis. A teleoperation system consisting of a commercial master haptic device, a custom needle-steering robot slave, and visual feedback to the operator was assembled. Human subjects experiments were performed to evaluate targeting accuracy in phantom tissue for three needle control methods: teleoperation of both insertion and spin, teleoperation of insertion with open-loop-controlled spin, and open-loop control of both insertion and spin. Targeting accuracy improved with increasing degrees of freedom of human (teleoperation) control, primarily because tissue deformation and modeling limitations result in open-loop control errors. Subjects typically performed multiple spins of the needle during insertion in order to fine tune the needle path. In addition, position, rate, and a nonlinear hybrid control were compared during teleoperation of the insertion degree of freedom. The hybrid method resulted in significantly better targeting accuracy","doi":"10.1109/ROBOT.2007.363105","publicationTitle":"Proceedings 2007 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings 2007 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel5/4209048/4209049/04209209.pdf","startPage":"934","endPage":"939","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ROBOT.2007.363105","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4209049","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Teleoperation of Steerable Needles","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4209209","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-14 April 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4209209/","displayDocTitle":"Teleoperation of Steerable Needles","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2007","accessionNumber":"9506312","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4209209/","conferenceDate":"10-14 April 2007","dateOfInsertion":"21 May 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Teleoperation of Steerable Needles","confLoc":"Rome, Italy","sourcePdf":"ROBOT-00-160.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.090579S","chronDate":"10-14 April 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4209048","isNumber":"4209049","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4209048","citationCount":"25","xplore-issue":"4209049","articleId":"4209209","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":4209228,"authors":[{"name":"Jin-Wook Lee","affiliation":["Institute of Advanced Aerospace Technology School of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, Seoul National University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Jin-Wook","lastName":"Lee","id":"38257086200"},{"name":"H.

For speeding up point matching methods, the large amount of range data should be reduced. This sampling, in turn, can have a significant impact on accuracy. In particular, genetic algorithms provide a robust optimization method that avoids local minima for scan matching, but their computational cost grows with the number of points. This paper proposes a new point sampling strategy that considers the spherical scanning process of most sensors to equalize the measure-direction density. This fast sampling method reduces the number of points without loss of relevant scene information. It is experimentally compared with other systematic approaches for the case of actual scene genetic registration.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4209236/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-14 April 2007","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"10-14 April 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4209236/","dateOfInsertion":"21 May 2007","publicationDate":"April 2007","accessionNumber":"9538257","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Spherical Laser Point Sampling with Application to 3D Scene Genetic Registration","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spherical Laser Point Sampling with Application to 3D Scene Genetic Registration","confLoc":"Rome, Italy","sourcePdf":"ROBOT-00-187.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04545S","chronDate":"10-14 April 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4209048","isNumber":"4209049","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4209048","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4209049","articleId":"4209236","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4209259,"authors":[{"name":"Takeshi Ando","affiliation":["Graduate School of Science and Engineering, Waseda University, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Takeshi","lastName":"Ando","id":"37285644700"},{"name":"Jun Okamoto","affiliation":["Consolidated Research Institute for Advanced Science and Medical Care, Waseda University, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Jun","lastName":"Okamoto","id":"37273301800"},{"name":"Masakatsu G.

In their final stages of life, the pain is such that they cannot even roll over, one of the activities of daily life. With this in mind, in this research, we aim to develop equipment for patients with cancer bone metastasis to support roll-overs in terminal care. Specifically, the EMG signal, which is the input signal of the equipment, is discussed in this paper. The activities of four muscles affecting trunk movement were monitored during the process of rolling over. Following an EMG experiment with four subjects, the internal abdominal oblique (IO) muscle was seen to be active in the early stages of roll-over motion, although IO muscle was relatively prevalent in previous works. If we support roll-over at this point, the patient feels no pain, because the timing is detected before the strongest burden movement, which involves buoying the trunk and rotating the pelvis. Hence, the EMG signal of the IO muscle is suitable for the input of the signal to support roll-overs.","doi":"10.1109/ROBOT.2007.363155","pdfPath":"/iel5/4209048/4209049/04209259.pdf","startPage":"1244","endPage":"1249","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings 2007 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","publicationTitle":"Proceedings 2007 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ROBOT.2007.363155","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4209049","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Development of roll-over support system with EMG control for cancer bone metastasis patients","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4209259/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-14 April 2007","displayDocTitle":"Development of roll-over support system with EMG control for cancer bone metastasis patients","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"21 May 2007","accessionNumber":"9538190","publicationDate":"April 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4209259/","conferenceDate":"10-14 April 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Development of roll-over support system with EMG control for cancer bone metastasis patients","confLoc":"Rome, Italy","sourcePdf":"ROBOT-00-210.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052716S","chronDate":"10-14 April 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4209048","isNumber":"4209049","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4209048","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"4209049","articleId":"4209259","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4209276,"authors":[{"name":"Todd Templeton","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences, University of California, Berkeley, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Todd","lastName":"Templeton","id":"37298885300"},{"name":"David Hyunchul Shim","affiliation":["Department of Aerospace Engineering, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejeon, South Korea"],"firstName":"David Hyunchul","lastName":"Shim","id":"37281960000"},{"name":"Christopher Geyer","affiliation":["Robotics Institute, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Christopher","lastName":"Geyer","id":"37286027800"},{"name":"S.

The vision system determines the best trajectory to cover large areas of terrain or to perform closer inspection of potential landing sites, and the flight control system guides the vehicle through the requested flight pattern by tracking the reference trajectory as computed by a real-time MPC-based optimization. This trajectory layer, which uses a constrained system model, provides an abstraction between the vision system and the vehicle.

For the precise manipulation of small particles with sizes on the order of 10 nm, however, automation has remained an elusive goal, primarily because of the spatial uncertainties associated with the positioning mechanisms of the AFM and with the manipulation process itself. Extensive user intervention has been necessary for the construction of desired nanostructures with the AFM, resulting in very low throughput, and severely limiting the complexity of structures that could be built with a reasonable amount of time and labor. This paper describes a fully automatic system for building arbitrary planar patterns of nanoparticles by AFM manipulation. Given an initial, random distribution of particles on a substrate surface and a desired pattern to be formed with them, a planner determines the paths required to perform the manipulation operations. The output of the planner is a sequence of primitive commands for positioning and pushing operations involving motion along line segments. The primitive commands are executed through software that compensates for thermal drift, creep and hysteresis. Experimental results presented here show that the system can build in minutes a pattern that normally would take an experienced user a whole day to construct interactively.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings 2007 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel5/4209048/4209049/04209285.pdf","startPage":"1406","endPage":"1412","publicationTitle":"Proceedings 2007 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","doi":"10.1109/ROBOT.2007.363181","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ROBOT.2007.363181","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4209049","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4209285","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Automated Nanomanipulation with Atomic Force Microscopes","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Atomic force microscopy","Nanobioscience","Creep","Hysteresis","Nanoparticles","Uncertainty","Assembly","Voltage","Throughput","Feedback"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["atomic force microscopy","control engineering computing","creep","hysteresis","micromanipulators","motion control","nanotechnology","physics computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["automated nanomanipulation","atomic force microscopes","positioning mechanisms","nanoparticles","AFM manipulation","thermal drift","creep","hysteresis","10 nm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Atomic Force Microscopes","AFMs","automatic nanomanipulation","drift","creep","hysteresis","nanorobotics"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4209285/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-14 April 2007","displayDocTitle":"Automated Nanomanipulation with Atomic Force Microscopes","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4209285/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2007","accessionNumber":"9517471","dateOfInsertion":"21 May 2007","conferenceDate":"10-14 April 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Automated Nanomanipulation with Atomic Force Microscopes","confLoc":"Rome, Italy","sourcePdf":"ROBOT-00-236.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058884S","chronDate":"10-14 April 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4209048","isNumber":"4209049","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4209048","citationCount":"29","xplore-issue":"4209049","articleId":"4209285","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4209295,"authors":[{"name":"John R.

The robot successfully negotiates obstacles up to 7.5 cm (ap40% leg length) tall and navigates over rocky terrain.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings 2007 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel5/4209048/4209049/04209295.pdf","startPage":"1467","endPage":"1473","publicationTitle":"Proceedings 2007 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","doi":"10.1109/ROBOT.2007.363191","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ROBOT.2007.363191","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4209049","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4209295","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Controller for the LittleDog Quadruped Walking on Rough Terrain","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Legged locomotion","Foot","Leg","Robot sensing systems","Navigation","Stability","Motion control","Measurement units","Knee","Search problems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["collision avoidance","image motion analysis","legged locomotion","robot kinematics","robot vision","stability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["LittleDog quadruped robot","walking controller","rough terrain","static walking","deliberative components","reactive components","task specific control","impassable terrain","unmodeled foot slippage","controller architecture","multiple gait controller","stable omnidirectional gait","directional gait","obstacle negotiation","rocky terrain"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4209295/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-14 April 2007","displayDocTitle":"A Controller for the LittleDog Quadruped Walking on Rough Terrain","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4209295/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2007","accessionNumber":"9517423","dateOfInsertion":"21 May 2007","conferenceDate":"10-14 April 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Controller for the LittleDog Quadruped Walking on Rough Terrain","confLoc":"Rome, Italy","sourcePdf":"ROBOT-00-246.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05575S","chronDate":"10-14 April 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4209048","isNumber":"4209049","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4209048","citationCount":"81","xplore-issue":"4209049","articleId":"4209295","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":4209302,"authors":[{"name":"Yong-Lae Park","affiliation":["Center for Design Research, University of Stanford, Stanford, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Yong-Lae","lastName":"Park","id":"37600943600"},{"name":"Kelvin Chau","affiliation":["Intelligent Fiber Optic Systems Corporation, Santa Clara, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Kelvin","lastName":"Chau","id":"37671248500"},{"name":"Richard J.

By purposefully biasing the sampling distribution and re-using branches from previous planning iterations, MP-RRT combines the strengths of existing adaptations of RRT for dynamic motion planning.

To face these problems we applied the probabilistic velocity obstacle (PVO) approach (Kluge and Prassler, 2004) to a dynamic occupancy grid. The paper presents a method to estimate the probability of collision where uncertainty in position, shape and velocity of the obstacles, occlusions and limited sensor range contribute directly to the computation. A simple navigation algorithm is then presented in order to apply the method to collision avoidance and goal driven control. Simulation results show that the robot is able to adapt its behaviour to the level of available knowledge and navigate safely among obstacles with a constant linear velocity. Extensions to non-linear, non-constant velocities are proposed.","doi":"10.1109/ROBOT.2007.363554","publicationTitle":"Proceedings 2007 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings 2007 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel5/4209048/4209049/04209318.pdf","startPage":"1610","endPage":"1616","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ROBOT.2007.363554","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4209049","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4209318","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dynamic Obstacle Avoidance in uncertain environment combining PVOs and Occupancy Grid","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Dynamic Obstacle Avoidance in uncertain environment combining PVOs and Occupancy Grid","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4209318/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-14 April 2007","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4209318/","dateOfInsertion":"21 May 2007","publicationDate":"April 2007","accessionNumber":"9528573","conferenceDate":"10-14 April 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamic Obstacle Avoidance in uncertain environment combining PVOs and Occupancy Grid","confLoc":"Rome, Italy","sourcePdf":"ROBOT-00-269.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064047S","chronDate":"10-14 April 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4209048","isNumber":"4209049","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4209048","citationCount":"113","xplore-issue":"4209049","articleId":"4209318","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-22"},{"_id":4209319,"authors":[{"name":"Nik A.

However, little work has been done to combine these techniques to create new distributions. In this paper, we propose to bias one sampling distribution with another such that the resulting distribution out-performs either of its parent distributions. We present a general framework for biasing samplers that is easily extendable to new distributions and can handle an arbitrary number of parent distributions by chaining them together. Our experimental results show that by combining distributions, we can out-perform existing planners.

In this paper, we studied how a mobile robot, equipped with a 3D laser scanner, can learn to perceive the traversability affordance and use it to wander in a room tilled with spheres, cylinders and boxes. The results showed that after learning, the robot can wander around avoiding contact with non-traversable objects (i.e. boxes, upright cylinders, or lying cylinders in certain orientation), but moving over traversable objects (such as spheres, and lying cylinders in a rollable orientation with respect to the robot) rolling them out of its way. We have shown that for each action approximately 1% of the perceptual features were relevant to determine whether it is afforded or not and that these relevant features are positioned in certain regions of the range image. The experiments are conducted both using a physics-based simulator and on a real robot.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Mobile robots","Animals","Robot control","Robot sensing systems","Psychology","Organisms","Shape","Robotics and automation","Object detection","Leg"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["collision avoidance","mobile robots","motion control","optical scanners"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["traversability affordance","range images","mobile robot","autonomous robot control","3D laser scanner","nontraversable object avoidance"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ROBOT.2007.363571","publicationTitle":"Proceedings 2007 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings 2007 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel5/4209048/4209049/04209335.pdf","startPage":"1721","endPage":"1726","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4209049","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ROBOT.2007.363571","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The learning and use of traversability affordance using range images on a mobile robot","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4209335","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"The learning and use of traversability affordance using range images on a mobile robot","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4209335/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4209335/","accessionNumber":"9517484","conferenceDate":"10-14 April 2007","dateOfInsertion":"21 May 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-14 April 2007","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The learning and use of traversability affordance using range images on a mobile robot","confLoc":"Rome, Italy","sourcePdf":"ROBOT-00-286.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053146S","chronDate":"10-14 April 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4209048","isNumber":"4209049","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4209048","citationCount":"37","xplore-issue":"4209049","articleId":"4209335","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4209354,"authors":[{"name":"Gorkem Erinc","affiliation":["School of Engineering and Science, International University Bremen, Germany","School of Engineering and Science, International University, Bremen, Germany"],"firstName":"Gorkem","lastName":"Erinc","id":"37681917700"},{"name":"Stefano Carpin","affiliation":["School of Engineering, University of California, Merced, USA"],"firstName":"Stefano","lastName":"Carpin","id":"37328709200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0602-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0601-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1050-4729"}],"articleNumber":"4209354","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":19,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":210},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Genetic algorithms","Motion planning","Iterative algorithms","Mobile robots","Path planning","Genetic engineering","Vehicles","Robotics and automation","USA Councils","Algorithm design and analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithms","iterative methods","mobile robots","path planning"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithm","nonholonomic motion planning","mobile robots","randomized algorithm","iterative optimization","fitness function"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["nonholonomic motion planning","genetic algorithms","mobile robots"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4209354","abstract":"The paper presents a genetic algorithm to find and optimize solutions for nonholonomic motion planning problems.

It applies surgical tasks involving a contact between an instrument and a moving organ. It is well known that conventional force control allows for compensating the motion of the environment thanks to its natural disturbance rejection capabilities. However, as experimentally evidenced in the first part of this paper, bandwidth limitations do not allow for exact disturbance rejection. Therefore, in addition to a conventional inner force feedback control loop, an outer control loop based on iterative learning control (ILC) is implemented. It is aimed at compensating the physiological motions, based on the hypothesis that the disturbance is periodic. The transient performances of this ILC controller are improved thanks to a wavelet transform-based approach and conclusive experiments are finally presented, evidencing that the tracking performance under cyclic disturbances is significantly improved.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Physiological Motion Compensation in Robotized Surgery using Force Feedback Control","publicationTitle":"Proceedings 2007 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","doi":"10.1109/ROBOT.2007.363596","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings 2007 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel5/4209048/4209049/04209360.pdf","startPage":"1881","endPage":"1886","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ROBOT.2007.363596","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4209049","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4209360","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4209360/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-14 April 2007","displayDocTitle":"Physiological Motion Compensation in Robotized Surgery using Force Feedback Control","conferenceDate":"10-14 April 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4209360/","dateOfInsertion":"21 May 2007","publicationDate":"April 2007","accessionNumber":"9528567","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Physiological Motion Compensation in Robotized Surgery using Force Feedback Control","confLoc":"Rome, Italy","sourcePdf":"ROBOT-00-311.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.096772S","chronDate":"10-14 April 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4209048","isNumber":"4209049","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4209048","citationCount":"35","xplore-issue":"4209049","articleId":"4209360","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4209361,"authors":[{"name":"Patrick Sears","affiliation":["Aerospace and Mechanical Engineering, Boston University, Boston, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Patrick","lastName":"Sears","id":"37695101800"},{"name":"Pierre E.

The curvature and extent of these needles can be controlled by the relative rotation and translation of the individual tubes. Under certain assumptions on the geometry and design of these needles, the forward kinematics problem can be solved in closed form by means of algebraic equations. The inverse kinematics problem, however, is not as straightforward owing to the nonlinear map between relative tube displacements and needle tip configuration as well as to the multiplicity of solutions as the number of tubes increases. This paper presents a general approach to solving the inverse kinematics problem using a pseudoinverse solution together with gradients of nullspace potential functions to enforce geometric and mechanical constraints.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Inverse Kinematics of Concentric Tube Steerable Needles","publicationTitle":"Proceedings 2007 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","doi":"10.1109/ROBOT.2007.363597","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings 2007 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel5/4209048/4209049/04209361.pdf","startPage":"1887","endPage":"1892","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ROBOT.2007.363597","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4209049","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4209361","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4209361/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-14 April 2007","displayDocTitle":"Inverse Kinematics of Concentric Tube Steerable Needles","conferenceDate":"10-14 April 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4209361/","dateOfInsertion":"21 May 2007","publicationDate":"April 2007","accessionNumber":"9517495","pubMedId":"23685532","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Inverse Kinematics of Concentric Tube Steerable Needles","confLoc":"Rome, Italy","sourcePdf":"ROBOT-00-312.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044805S","chronDate":"10-14 April 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4209048","isNumber":"4209049","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4209048","citationCount":"42","xplore-issue":"4209049","articleId":"4209361","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":4209367,"authors":[{"name":"Leonardo Mattos","affiliation":["Center for Robotics and Intelligent Machines, North Carolina State University, Raleigh, NC, USA"],"firstName":"Leonardo","lastName":"Mattos","id":"37283193500"},{"name":"Edward Grant","affiliation":["Center for Robotics and Intelligent Machines, North Carolina State University, Raleigh, NC, USA"],"firstName":"Edward","lastName":"Grant","id":"37279931800"},{"name":"Randy Thresher","affiliation":["Animal Models Core Facility, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC, USA"],"firstName":"Randy","lastName":"Thresher","id":"37317366200"},{"name":"Kim Kluckman","affiliation":["Animal Models Core Facility, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC, USA"],"firstName":"Kim","lastName":"Kluckman","id":"37317364300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0602-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0601-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1050-4729"}],"articleNumber":"4209367","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":24,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":238},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Microinjection","Humans","Kinematics","Robotics and automation","Manipulators","Motion control","Motion planning","Microscopy","Automatic control","Control systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["human computer interaction","manipulator kinematics","medical robotics","micromanipulators","motion control","position control","telerobotics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["blastocyst microinjection","piezoelectric kinematic stage","DC motor-based robot manipulator","pipette motion control","Petri dish manipulation","SSD template matching","cross-correlation template matching","pipette localization","human-control interface","cell injection","biomanipulation","teleoperation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cell injection","biomanipulation","teleoperation","microrobotic system"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents results related to our latest semi-automated blastocyst microinjection system. Here, the improvements made to the microinjection system are described and evaluated. First, after replacing the original piezo-electric kinematic stage by a DC motor-based robot manipulator, experimentation showed that the speed and the precise motion control of pipettes were improved. Second, by introducing an X-Y stage into the system, to manipulate the Petri dish around the microscope's field of view, multiple microinjection speed was improved. Third, by using SSD template matching to track the injection pipette, rather than the cross-correlation template matching algorithm used in the original system, improvements were made to pipette localization. Under human control, this new semi-automated system gives improved microinjection performance metrics compared to previously obtained results. The system is also providing implicit human knowledge of the microinjection process via the human-control interface. It is the encoding of this knowledge that will lead to the first fully automated system. The semi-automated microinjection system is being tested and evaluated in the AMC at UNC-Chapel Hill.","doi":"10.1109/ROBOT.2007.363603","publicationTitle":"Proceedings 2007 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings 2007 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel5/4209048/4209049/04209367.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ROBOT.2007.363603","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4209049","startPage":"1924","endPage":"1929","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"New Developments Towards Automated Blastocyst Microinjections","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4209367","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"New Developments Towards Automated Blastocyst Microinjections","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-14 April 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4209367/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"10-14 April 2007","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2007","accessionNumber":"9517399","dateOfInsertion":"21 May 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4209367/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"New Developments Towards Automated Blastocyst Microinjections","confLoc":"Rome, Italy","sourcePdf":"ROBOT-00-318.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061033S","chronDate":"10-14 April 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4209048","isNumber":"4209049","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4209048","citationCount":"24","xplore-issue":"4209049","articleId":"4209367","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4209381,"authors":[{"name":"T.

By learning a generative model of appearance, we can compute not only the similarity of two observations, but also the probability that they originate from the same location, and hence compute a pdf over observer location. We do not limit ourselves to the kidnapped robot problem (localizing in a known map), but admit the possibility that observations may come from previously unvisited places. The principled probabilistic approach we develop allows us to explicitly account for the perceptual aliasing in the environment - identical but indistinctive observations receive a low probability of having come from the same place. Our algorithm complexity is linear in the number of places, and is particularly suitable for online loop closure detection in mobile robotics.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4209386/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-14 April 2007","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"21 May 2007","accessionNumber":"9517369","publicationDate":"April 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4209386/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"10-14 April 2007","displayDocTitle":"Probabilistic Appearance Based Navigation and Loop Closing","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Probabilistic Appearance Based Navigation and Loop Closing","confLoc":"Rome, Italy","sourcePdf":"ROBOT-00-337.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061303S","chronDate":"10-14 April 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4209048","isNumber":"4209049","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4209048","citationCount":"93","xplore-issue":"4209049","articleId":"4209386","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-15"},{"_id":4209405,"authors":[{"name":"Dongheui Lee","affiliation":["Department of Mechano-Informatics, University of Tokyo, Bunkyo, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Dongheui","lastName":"Lee","id":"37280602300"},{"name":"Yoshihiko Nakamura","affiliation":["Department of Mechano-Informatics, University of Tokyo, Bunkyo, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Yoshihiko","lastName":"Nakamura","id":"37280754600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0602-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0601-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1050-4729"}],"articleNumber":"4209405","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":15,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":154},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Machine vision","Humanoid robots","Hidden Markov models","Cameras","Biological system modeling","Human robot interaction","Nonlinear optics","Image sequences","Image recognition","Multidimensional systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biomimetics","hidden Markov models","humanoid robots","image sequences","man-machine systems","motion estimation","pose estimation","robot vision"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mimesis scheme","monocular vision system","humanoid robot","optical motion capturing system","motion pattern","humanoid imitation learning","hidden Markov model","human-robot interaction","2D image sequence","pose estimation","motion estimation","3D space","partial observation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["monocular vision","mimesis model","proto-symbol","partial observations","Multidimensional scaling"]}],"abstract":"Optical motion capturing systems are widely used to acquire human beings' motion patterns in humanoid imitation learning research. However, optical motion capturing systems have a restricted movable area. This paper proposes the HMM based mimesis scheme using a monocular camera mounted on a humanoid. This scheme releases the restriction of movable area and enables imitation in daily life environments. Also, natural human-robot-interaction is expected during imitation. From two-dimensional image sequences of the demonstrator's motion, the demonstrator's pose and motion is estimated and recognized through the mimesis model and the humanoid generates its joint motor commands for imitation in 3D space. The feasibility of the proposed scheme is demonstrated by simulation.","doi":"10.1109/ROBOT.2007.363641","publicationTitle":"Proceedings 2007 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings 2007 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel5/4209048/4209049/04209405.pdf","startPage":"2162","endPage":"2168","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ROBOT.2007.363641","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4209049","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Mimesis Scheme using a Monocular Vision System on a Humanoid Robot","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4209405","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-14 April 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4209405/","displayDocTitle":"Mimesis Scheme using a Monocular Vision System on a Humanoid Robot","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2007","accessionNumber":"9538236","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4209405/","conferenceDate":"10-14 April 2007","dateOfInsertion":"21 May 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Mimesis Scheme using a Monocular Vision System on a Humanoid Robot","confLoc":"Rome, Italy","sourcePdf":"ROBOT-00-356.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060149S","chronDate":"10-14 April 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4209048","isNumber":"4209049","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4209048","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"4209049","articleId":"4209405","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4209447,"authors":[{"name":"J.F.

The approach provides for the use of raw sensor measurements directly in SLAM, thus obviating the need to extract landmarks using complex feature extraction methods and data association. In this paper a solution framework based on Rao-Blackwellized particle filters (RB) and genetic algorithms (GA) is proposed for recovering the full SLAM posterior using raw exteroceptive sensor measurements, i.e. without landmarks. The resultant Rao-Blackwellized genetic algorithmic filter (RBGAF) permits the uses of any arbitrary measurement model unlike FastSLAM with scan matching. Since the proposed method represents the environmental map state for each robot trajectory using a population of chromosomes as opposed to grids, RBGAF is much more memory efficient than DP-SLAM. Memory efficiency is further enhanced through the exploitation of dynamic data structures for representing the maps and the robot trajectories. This makes the proposed RBGAF very suitable for large scale SLAM in 3D environments. Further, the proposed method's provision for adaptation of chromosome lifetime/group sizes and its ability to incorporate alternative map representations makes it adaptable to varied environments and different sensors. Simulation and experimental results obtained in an outdoor environment using a laser measurement system are presented to demonstrate the method's effectiveness.","doi":"10.1109/ROBOT.2007.363683","pdfPath":"/iel5/4209048/4209049/04209447.pdf","startPage":"2427","endPage":"2432","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings 2007 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","publicationTitle":"Proceedings 2007 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ROBOT.2007.363683","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4209049","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Efficient Rao-Blackwellized Genetic Algorithmic Filter for SLAM","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4209447/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-14 April 2007","displayDocTitle":"An Efficient Rao-Blackwellized Genetic Algorithmic Filter for SLAM","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"21 May 2007","accessionNumber":"9528619","publicationDate":"April 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4209447/","conferenceDate":"10-14 April 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Efficient Rao-Blackwellized Genetic Algorithmic Filter for SLAM","confLoc":"Rome, Italy","sourcePdf":"ROBOT-00-398.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.039838S","chronDate":"10-14 April 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4209048","isNumber":"4209049","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4209048","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"4209049","articleId":"4209447","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4209448,"authors":[{"name":"Kristopher R.

That is, their reliance on collision tests as the only means of sensing the environment yields a tactile, myopic perception of the world. Such short-sightedness greatly limits any potential for detection, learning, or reasoning about frequently encountered situations. As a result, it is common for current planners to solve and re-solve the same general scenarios over and over, each time none the wiser. We thus propose a general approach for motion planning, as well as a specific illustrative algorithm, in which local sensory information, in conjunction with prior accumulated experience, are exploited to improve planner performance. Our approach relies on learning viability models for the agent's \"perceptual space\", and the use thereof to direct planning effort. Experiments with three test agents show significant speedups and skill-transfer between environments.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4209049","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ROBOT.2007.363873","publicationTitle":"Proceedings 2007 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings 2007 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel5/4209048/4209049/04209491.pdf","startPage":"2700","endPage":"2705","doi":"10.1109/ROBOT.2007.363873","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Faster Motion Planning Using Learned Local Viability Models","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-14 April 2007","displayDocTitle":"Faster Motion Planning Using Learned Local Viability Models","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"10-14 April 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4209491/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2007","accessionNumber":"9517485","dateOfInsertion":"21 May 2007","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4209491/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Faster Motion Planning Using Learned Local Viability Models","confLoc":"Rome, Italy","sourcePdf":"ROBOT-00-442.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063098S","chronDate":"10-14 April 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4209048","isNumber":"4209049","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4209048","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"4209049","articleId":"4209491","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4209540,"authors":[{"name":"Vladimir Y.

Operation of compass (magnetometer) is assumed on a mobile robot that is capable to traverse a complete circular path. The electronic compass is used to estimate a robot absolute heading with respect to the magnetic North. This is only compass approach where an evaluation of quality of calibration and magnetic environment is important as much as calibration itself. In this method, compass is able to detect the external magnetic interference and estimate it numerically. The approach also relates to automatic calibration and requires one full 360-degree rotation and multiple points for further analysis. This enhanced calibration procedure is performed in the magnetic field domain and implemented using a non-iterative algebraic technique. The quality of calibration is a function of input data goodness and how successful is the fitting procedure. The magnetic environment evaluation is performed by the distortion factor that is calculated at the end of calibration and helps to estimate quantitatively local external magnetic distortions and their influence on a heading measurement. The validity of this approach has been verified experimentally by using robot with electronic compass.","doi":"10.1109/ROBOT.2007.363922","pdfPath":"/iel5/4209048/4209049/04209540.pdf","startPage":"2963","endPage":"2970","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings 2007 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","publicationTitle":"Proceedings 2007 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ROBOT.2007.363922","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4209049","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Application of Electronic Compass for Mobile Robot in an Indoor Environment","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4209540/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-14 April 2007","displayDocTitle":"Application of Electronic Compass for Mobile Robot in an Indoor Environment","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"21 May 2007","accessionNumber":"9538179","publicationDate":"April 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4209540/","conferenceDate":"10-14 April 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Application of Electronic Compass for Mobile Robot in an Indoor Environment","confLoc":"Rome, Italy","sourcePdf":"ROBOT-00-491.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061183S","chronDate":"10-14 April 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4209048","isNumber":"4209049","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4209048","citationCount":"24","xplore-issue":"4209049","articleId":"4209540","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4209553,"authors":[{"name":"Naotaka Hikosaka","affiliation":["Precision Engineering, School of Science and Engineering, Chuo University, Bunkyo, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Naotaka","lastName":"Hikosaka","id":"37695699600"},{"name":"Kei Watanabe","affiliation":["Precision Engineering, School of Science and Engineering, Chuo University, Bunkyo, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Kei","lastName":"Watanabe","id":"37696396100"},{"name":"Kazunori Umeda","affiliation":["Precision Engineering, School of Science and Engineering, Chuo University, Bunkyo, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Kazunori","lastName":"Umeda","id":"37269782700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0602-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0601-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1050-4729"}],"articleNumber":"4209553","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":87},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image sensors","Robot sensing systems","Legged locomotion","Laser theory","Mobile robots","Stereo vision","Fiber lasers","Optical sensors","Robotics and automation","Sensor phenomena and characterization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["collision avoidance","humanoid robots","image sensors","mobile robots","object detection","object recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["obstacle detection","humanoid robot","relative disparity map","image sensor","humanoid walking","planar region detection","pose parameter"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, methods for detecting obstacles on a plane using a relative disparity map (RDMap) are proposed and discussed. The RDMap, which was formerly introduced by the author Umeda, is relative to a plane that is observed at first as the reference. It has an interesting feature that a plane in real 3D space also becomes a plane in the map, and has homogeneous characteristics compared to an ordinary range image. The proposed methods work even when the pose of the sensor changes significantly, which is the case in humanoid walking. First, a method to detect planar regions and obstacles by fitting a plane to the RDMap and a method to obtain the pose parameters from the RDMap are introduced. Fundamental experiments are then conducted to verify that a plane in real 3D space becomes a plane in the RDMap and that obstacles can be detected using the residual sum of squares for the fitted plane, and measurement errors in pose parameters are then evaluated. Finally, an experimental system with a humanoid and a small range image sensor is constructed, and it is demonstrated that the humanoid can detect obstacles on a plane by the proposed methods while walking.","doi":"10.1109/ROBOT.2007.363935","publicationTitle":"Proceedings 2007 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings 2007 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel5/4209048/4209049/04209553.pdf","startPage":"3048","endPage":"3053","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ROBOT.2007.363935","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4209049","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Obstacle Detection of a Humanoid on a Plane Using a Relative Disparity Map Obtained by a Small Range Image Sensor","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4209553","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-14 April 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4209553/","displayDocTitle":"Obstacle Detection of a Humanoid on a Plane Using a Relative Disparity Map Obtained by a Small Range Image Sensor","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2007","accessionNumber":"9538199","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4209553/","conferenceDate":"10-14 April 2007","dateOfInsertion":"21 May 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Obstacle Detection of a Humanoid on a Plane Using a Relative Disparity Map Obtained by a Small Range Image Sensor","confLoc":"Rome, Italy","sourcePdf":"ROBOT-00-504.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.075828S","chronDate":"10-14 April 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4209048","isNumber":"4209049","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4209048","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4209049","articleId":"4209553","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4209581,"authors":[{"name":"Hyukseong Kwon","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, USA"],"firstName":"Hyukseong","lastName":"Kwon","id":"37554706900"},{"name":"Johnny Park","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, USA"],"firstName":"Johnny","lastName":"Park","id":"37281012300"},{"name":"Avinash C.

One advantage of active stereo in relation to regular stereo is the former's wider effective field of view; if an object is too close to the camera baseline, the depth to the object can still be estimated accurately by panning the cameras appropriately. Another advantage of active stereo is that it can yield a larger number of depth measurements simultaneously for each position of the platform on which the camera system is mounted. Panning and tilting over a large angular range, while being the main reason for the advantages of active stereo, also make it more challenging to calibrate such systems. For a calibration procedure to be effective for active stereo, the estimated parameters must be valid over the entire range of the pan and tilt angles. This paper presents a new approach to the calibration of such vision systems. Our method is based on the rationale that an active stereo calibration procedure must explicitly estimate the locations and the orientations of the pan and tilt rotating axes for the cameras through a closed-form solution. When these estimates for the axes are combined with the homogeneous transform relationships that link the various coordinate frames, we end with a calibration that is valid over a large variation in the pan and tilt angles.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4209049","publicationTitle":"Proceedings 2007 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings 2007 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel5/4209048/4209049/04209581.pdf","doi":"10.1109/ROBOT.2007.363963","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ROBOT.2007.363963","startPage":"3180","endPage":"3185","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A New Approach for Active Stereo Camera Calibration","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"10-14 April 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4209581/","displayDocTitle":"A New Approach for Active Stereo Camera Calibration","htmlLink":"/document/4209581/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"10-14 April 2007","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"9517405","dateOfInsertion":"21 May 2007","publicationDate":"April 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A New Approach for Active Stereo Camera Calibration","confLoc":"Rome, Italy","sourcePdf":"ROBOT-00-532.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048741S","chronDate":"10-14 April 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4209048","isNumber":"4209049","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4209048","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4209049","articleId":"4209581","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":4209583,"authors":[{"name":"Yoshihiro Watanabe","affiliation":["Graduate School of Information Science and Technology, University of Tokyo, Bunkyo, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Yoshihiro","lastName":"Watanabe","id":"37277581700"},{"name":"Takashi Komuro","affiliation":["Graduate School of Information Science and Technology, University of Tokyo, Bunkyo, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Takashi","lastName":"Komuro","id":"37270845100"},{"name":"Masatoshi Ishikawa","affiliation":["Graduate School of Information Science and Technology, University of Tokyo, Bunkyo, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Masatoshi","lastName":"Ishikawa","id":"37276508700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0602-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0601-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1050-4729"}],"articleNumber":"4209583","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":53,"citationCountPatent":6,"totalDownloads":428},"abstract":"This paper describes real-time shape measurement using a newly developed high-speed vision system.

We propose a utility-guided roadmap planner that incorporates uncertainty directly into the planning process. This enables the planner to identify configuration space paths that minimize uncertainty and, when necessary, efficiently pursue further exploration through utility-guided sensing of the workspace. Experimental results indicate that our utility-guided approach results in a robust planner even in the presence of significant error in its perception of the workspace. Furthermore, we show how the planner is able to reduce the amount of required sensing to compute a successful plan","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4209049","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ROBOT.2007.363984","publicationTitle":"Proceedings 2007 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings 2007 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel5/4209048/4209049/04209602.pdf","startPage":"3313","endPage":"3318","doi":"10.1109/ROBOT.2007.363984","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sampling-Based Motion Planning With Sensing Uncertainty","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-14 April 2007","displayDocTitle":"Sampling-Based Motion Planning With Sensing Uncertainty","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"10-14 April 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4209602/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2007","accessionNumber":"9506340","dateOfInsertion":"21 May 2007","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4209602/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sampling-Based Motion Planning With Sensing Uncertainty","confLoc":"Rome, Italy","sourcePdf":"ROBOT-00-553.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046038S","chronDate":"10-14 April 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4209048","isNumber":"4209049","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4209048","citationCount":"39","xplore-issue":"4209049","articleId":"4209602","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4209603,"authors":[{"name":"Russell Gayle","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, USA"],"firstName":"Russell","lastName":"Gayle","id":"37282704500"},{"name":"Stephane Redon","affiliation":["INRIA Rhone-Alpes, France"],"firstName":"Stephane","lastName":"Redon","id":"37282913900"},{"name":"Avneesh Sud","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, USA"],"firstName":"Avneesh","lastName":"Sud","id":"37282556700"},{"name":"Ming C.

We adaptively reduce the complexity of the state space by determining a subset of joints that contribute most towards the motion and only simulate these joints. Based on these configurations, we compute a valid path that satisfies non-penetration, kinematic, and dynamics constraints.

It is passively moved by the peristaltic waves of gastro-intestinal tract and thus has some limitations for doctor to get the image of the organ and to diagnose more thoroughly. As a solution of these problems, therefore, a locomotive mechanism of capsule endoscopes has being developed. Our proposed capsule-type microrobot has synchronized multiple legs that are actuated by a linear actuator and two mobile cylinders inside of the capsule. By the novel kinematic relation between the legs and the mobile cylinders, the microrobot can easily move forward in the gastro-intestine. For the feasibility test of the proposed locomotive mechanism, a series of experiments were carried out including in-vitro and in-vivo tests. Based on the experimental results, we conclude that the proposed locomotive mechanism is not only easy to be used for micro capsule endoscopes but also effective to move inside of intestinal tract.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Endoscopes","Intestines","Leg","Legged locomotion","Hydraulic actuators","Commercialization","Micromotors","Testing","Robotics and automation","Mouth"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biological organs","legged locomotion","medical robotics","microrobots","patient diagnosis","robot kinematics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["paddling based microrobot","capsule endoscopes","digestive organ diagnosis","peristaltic waves","gastrointestinal tract","robot locomotion","synchronized multiple legs","linear actuator","mobile cylinders","kinematic relation"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ROBOT.2007.363994","publicationTitle":"Proceedings 2007 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings 2007 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel5/4209048/4209049/04209612.pdf","startPage":"3377","endPage":"3382","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4209049","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ROBOT.2007.363994","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Paddling based Microrobot for Capsule Endoscopes","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4209612","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Paddling based Microrobot for Capsule Endoscopes","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4209612/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4209612/","accessionNumber":"9538301","conferenceDate":"10-14 April 2007","dateOfInsertion":"21 May 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-14 April 2007","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Paddling based Microrobot for Capsule Endoscopes","confLoc":"Rome, Italy","sourcePdf":"ROBOT-00-563.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.121353S","chronDate":"10-14 April 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4209048","isNumber":"4209049","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4209048","citationCount":"55","xplore-issue":"4209049","articleId":"4209612","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-29"},{"_id":4209616,"authors":[{"name":"Kai O.

For these tasks, teleoperated systems are used, in which the human operator is integral part of the control. In time-delayed teleoperation, the operator gradually adopts discrete control strategies, such as 'move-and-wait'. In this paper, we present and compare three different control strategies for driving a nanomanipulation system with direct vision feedback. Two strategies are based on a fixed step size to move the manipulator, while the third uses a variable step size. The strategies are compared on a 2D fine positioning task. Experimental results are in agreement with Fitts' law and show that the third strategy, besides allowing movements of size ranging across several orders of magnitude, also allows to complete the fine positioning task in less time. The control strategies can be used in general to control vision-guided teleoperation systems affected by time delay.","doi":"10.1109/ROBOT.2007.364016","publicationTitle":"Proceedings 2007 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings 2007 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel5/4209048/4209049/04209634.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ROBOT.2007.364016","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4209049","startPage":"3514","endPage":"3519","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Control of a Teleoperated Nanomanipulator with Time Delay under Direct Vision Feedback","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4209634","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Control of a Teleoperated Nanomanipulator with Time Delay under Direct Vision Feedback","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-14 April 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4209634/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"10-14 April 2007","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2007","accessionNumber":"9552885","dateOfInsertion":"21 May 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4209634/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Control of a Teleoperated Nanomanipulator with Time Delay under Direct Vision Feedback","confLoc":"Rome, Italy","sourcePdf":"ROBOT-00-585.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.104396S","chronDate":"10-14 April 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4209048","isNumber":"4209049","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4209048","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"4209049","articleId":"4209634","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4209638,"authors":[{"name":"C.

The primary contribution of this work is the derivation of a measurement model that is able to express the geometric constraints that arise when a static feature is observed from multiple camera poses. This measurement model does not require including the 3D feature position in the state vector of the EKF and is optimal, up to linearization errors. The vision-aided inertial navigation algorithm we propose has computational complexity only linear in the number of features, and is capable of high-precision pose estimation in large-scale real-world environments. The performance of the algorithm is demonstrated in extensive experimental results, involving a camera/IMU system localizing within an urban area.","doi":"10.1109/ROBOT.2007.364024","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4209049","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ROBOT.2007.364024","publicationTitle":"Proceedings 2007 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings 2007 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel5/4209048/4209049/04209642.pdf","startPage":"3565","endPage":"3572","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Multi-State Constraint Kalman Filter for Vision-aided Inertial Navigation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"10-14 April 2007","displayDocTitle":"A Multi-State Constraint Kalman Filter for Vision-aided Inertial Navigation","isConference":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"10-14 April 2007","dateOfInsertion":"21 May 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4209642/","publicationDate":"April 2007","accessionNumber":"9538390","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4209642/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Multi-State Constraint Kalman Filter for Vision-aided Inertial Navigation","confLoc":"Rome, Italy","sourcePdf":"ROBOT-00-593.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050984S","chronDate":"10-14 April 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4209048","isNumber":"4209049","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4209048","citationCount":"487","xplore-issue":"4209049","articleId":"4209642","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4209654,"authors":[{"name":"B.

This paper extends the state-of-the-art by developing an assistant which actively cooperates during the point-to-point transportation of an object. Besides using admittance control to react to interaction forces generated by its operator, the robot estimates the intended human motion and uses this identified motion to move along with the operator. The offered level of assistance can be scaled, which is vital to give the operator the opportunity to gradually learn how to interact with the system. Experiments revealed that, while the robot is programmed to adapt to the human motion, the operator also adapts to the offered assistance. When using the robot assistant the required forces to move the load are greatly reduced and the operators report that the assistance feels comfortable and natural.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings 2007 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel5/4209048/4209049/04209654.pdf","startPage":"3639","endPage":"3644","publicationTitle":"Proceedings 2007 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","doi":"10.1109/ROBOT.2007.364036","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ROBOT.2007.364036","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4209049","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4209654","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Human-inspired robot assistant for fast point-to-point movements","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Admittance","Humans","Force control","Damping","Robot control","Control systems","Robotics and automation","Transportation","Force feedback","Motion control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive control","learning (artificial intelligence)","manipulators","man-machine systems","motion control","motion estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["human-inspired robot assistant","point-to-point movement","versatile robot assistants","cooperative object manipulation","point-to-point object transportation","admittance control","interaction forces","intended human motion estimation","learning","robot adaptation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4209654/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-14 April 2007","displayDocTitle":"Human-inspired robot assistant for fast point-to-point movements","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4209654/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2007","accessionNumber":"9572208","dateOfInsertion":"21 May 2007","conferenceDate":"10-14 April 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Human-inspired robot assistant for fast point-to-point movements","confLoc":"Rome, Italy","sourcePdf":"ROBOT-00-605.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042854S","chronDate":"10-14 April 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4209048","isNumber":"4209049","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4209048","citationCount":"86","xplore-issue":"4209049","articleId":"4209654","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":4209655,"authors":[{"name":"Gazihan Alankus","affiliation":["Washington University of Saint Louis, Saint Louis, USA"],"firstName":"Gazihan","lastName":"Alankus","id":"38559487800"},{"name":"Nuzhet Atay","affiliation":["Washington University of Saint Louis, Saint Louis, USA"],"firstName":"Nuzhet","lastName":"Atay","id":"38557916000"},{"name":"Chenyang Lu","affiliation":["Washington University of Saint Louis, Saint Louis, USA"],"firstName":"Chenyang","lastName":"Lu","id":"37280495900"},{"name":"O.

Mobile robots in the environment use the roadmap to reach their destinations. We evaluated the performance of embedded roadmap both in simulations using realistic conditions and with real hardware. Our results show that the proposed navigation algorithm is better suited for sensor networks than traditional navigation field based algorithms. Our observations suggest that there are two drawbacks of traditional navigation field based algorithms, (i) increased power consumption, (ii) message congestion that can prevent important danger avoidance messages to be received by the robots. In contrast, our approach significantly reduces the number of messages on the network (up to 160 times in some scenarios) while increasing the navigation performance.","doi":"10.1109/ROBOT.2007.364037","startPage":"3645","endPage":"3652","publicationTitle":"Proceedings 2007 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ROBOT.2007.364037","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4209049","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings 2007 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel5/4209048/4209049/04209655.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive Embedded Roadmaps For Sensor Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4209655/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Adaptive Embedded Roadmaps For Sensor Networks","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4209655/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9538233","publicationDate":"April 2007","dateOfInsertion":"21 May 2007","conferenceDate":"10-14 April 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-14 April 2007","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive Embedded Roadmaps For Sensor Networks","confLoc":"Rome, Italy","sourcePdf":"ROBOT-00-606.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05525S","chronDate":"10-14 April 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4209048","isNumber":"4209049","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4209048","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"4209049","articleId":"4209655","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4209659,"authors":[{"name":"Bin Zhang","affiliation":["Computer Science Department, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Bin","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37633761100"},{"name":"Gaurav S.

Mobile sensor platforms provide an ability to rapidly sample oceanographic data of interest for real-time input into ocean environmental models with the goal of reducing the modeling uncertainty by introducing selected sampled data. The major objective of this paper is to describe the autonomy architecture developed to support adaptive sampling. This architecture consists of an open-source distributed autonomy architecture and an approach to behavior-based control of autonomous vehicles using multiple objective functions that allows reactive control in complex environments with multiple constraints. Experimental results are provided for an adaptive ocean thermal gradient tracking application performed by an autonomous surface craft in Monterey Bay. These results highlight not only the suitability of autonomous sensor platforms for providing adaptive sampling of the ocean environment but, also, the suitability of our behavior-based autonomy approach and distributed autonomy architecture for providing a simple, flexible, and scalable method for autonomous sensor platform control. The paper concludes with an overview of future adaptive sampling experiments planned with autonomous underwater sensor platforms using the same methodology.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4209049","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ROBOT.2007.364132","publicationTitle":"Proceedings 2007 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings 2007 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel5/4209048/4209049/04209750.pdf","startPage":"4245","endPage":"4250","doi":"10.1109/ROBOT.2007.364132","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Behavior Based Adaptive Control for Autonomous Oceanographic Sampling","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-14 April 2007","displayDocTitle":"Behavior Based Adaptive Control for Autonomous Oceanographic Sampling","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"10-14 April 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4209750/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2007","accessionNumber":"9528445","dateOfInsertion":"21 May 2007","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4209750/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Behavior Based Adaptive Control for Autonomous Oceanographic Sampling","confLoc":"Rome, Italy","sourcePdf":"ROBOT-00-701.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.039871S","chronDate":"10-14 April 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4209048","isNumber":"4209049","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4209048","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"4209049","articleId":"4209750","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4209755,"authors":[{"name":"Andrea Gasparri","affiliation":["Dip. di Informatica e Automazione, University of Roma Tre, Rome, Italy"],"firstName":"Andrea","lastName":"Gasparri","id":"37298363400"},{"name":"Stefano Panzieri","affiliation":["Dip. di Informatica e Automazione, University of Roma Tre, Rome, Italy"],"firstName":"Stefano","lastName":"Panzieri","id":"37298364000"},{"name":"Federica Pascucci","affiliation":["Dip. di Informatica e Automazione, University of Roma Tre, Rome, Italy"],"firstName":"Federica","lastName":"Pascucci","id":"37298365200"},{"name":"Giovanni Ulivi","affiliation":["Dip. di Informatica e Automazione, University of Roma Tre, Rome, Italy"],"firstName":"Giovanni","lastName":"Ulivi","id":"37298366900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0602-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0601-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1050-4729"}],"articleNumber":"4209755","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":11,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":105},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Genetic algorithms","Complex networks","Mobile robots","Orbital robotics","Robotics and automation","Monte Carlo methods","Probability distribution","Space exploration","Filters","Robot sensing systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["complex networks","genetic algorithms","Kalman filters","mobile robots","Monte Carlo methods","search problems","SLAM (robots)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["spatially structured genetic algorithm","complex networks","mobile robot localisation","robot autonomy","Kalman filter","Monte Carlo integration","spatial deployment","search space modelling"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4209755","abstract":"One of the most important problems in mobile robotics is to realize the complete robot's autonomy.

The research community has provided, through the years, different methodologies to face the localisation problem, such as the Kalman filter or the Monte Carlo Integrations methods. In this paper a different approach relying on a specialisation of the genetic algorithms is proposed. The novelty of this approach is to take advantage of the complex networks theory for the spatial deployment of the population to more quickly find out the optimal solutions. In fact, modelling the search space with complex networks and exploiting their typical connectivity properties, results in a more effective exploration of such space.","doi":"10.1109/ROBOT.2007.364137","pdfPath":"/iel5/4209048/4209049/04209755.pdf","startPage":"4277","endPage":"4282","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings 2007 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","publicationTitle":"Proceedings 2007 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ROBOT.2007.364137","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4209049","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Spatially Structured Genetic Algorithm over Complex Networks for Mobile Robot Localisation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4209755/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-14 April 2007","displayDocTitle":"A Spatially Structured Genetic Algorithm over Complex Networks for Mobile Robot Localisation","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"21 May 2007","accessionNumber":"9538177","publicationDate":"April 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4209755/","conferenceDate":"10-14 April 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Spatially Structured Genetic Algorithm over Complex Networks for Mobile Robot Localisation","confLoc":"Rome, Italy","sourcePdf":"ROBOT-00-706.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.095752S","chronDate":"10-14 April 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4209048","isNumber":"4209049","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4209048","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"4209049","articleId":"4209755","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4209777,"authors":[{"name":"Daniel Raunhardt","affiliation":["Ecole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Daniel","lastName":"Raunhardt","id":"37646281400"},{"name":"Ronan Boulic","affiliation":["Ecole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Ronan","lastName":"Boulic","id":"37268027900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0602-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0601-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1050-4729"}],"articleNumber":"4209777","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":23,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":150},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Clamps","Kinematics","Robots","Manipulators","Damping","Robotics and automation","Linear systems","Equations","Least squares methods","Anisotropic magnetoresistance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["manipulator kinematics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["progressive clamping","kinematic anisotropy","virtual mannequins","robots","joint limit avoidance"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4209777","abstract":"In this paper we propose the progressive clamping method to better model the kinematic anisotropy of joint limits for virtual mannequins or robots.

This process is iterative within linear computing cost of the number of independent joints.

The robot localization is realized via the combination of the stereo vision and laser-activated RFID based on the principle of triangulation. The localization system functions like an indoor GPS. Preliminary research shows that the proposed system is promising to provide a robust and accurate indoor localization method for mobile robots.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4209049","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ROBOT.2007.364188","publicationTitle":"Proceedings 2007 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings 2007 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel5/4209048/4209049/04209806.pdf","startPage":"4600","endPage":"4605","doi":"10.1109/ROBOT.2007.364188","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Laser-activated RFID-based Indoor Localization System for Mobile Robots","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-14 April 2007","displayDocTitle":"Laser-activated RFID-based Indoor Localization System for Mobile Robots","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"10-14 April 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4209806/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2007","accessionNumber":"9561795","dateOfInsertion":"21 May 2007","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4209806/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Laser-activated RFID-based Indoor Localization System for Mobile Robots","confLoc":"Rome, Italy","sourcePdf":"ROBOT-00-757.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053102S","chronDate":"10-14 April 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4209048","isNumber":"4209049","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4209048","citationCount":"24","xplore-issue":"4209049","articleId":"4209806","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4209834,"authors":[{"name":"Anders Lau Olsen","affiliation":["The Maersk Mc-Kinney Moller Institute, University of Southern Denmark, Odense, Denmark"],"firstName":"Anders Lau","lastName":"Olsen","id":"37700443400"},{"name":"Henrik Gordon Petersen","affiliation":["The Maersk Mc-Kinney Moller Institute, University of Southern Denmark, Odense, Denmark"],"firstName":"Henrik Gordon","lastName":"Petersen","id":"37562505800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0602-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0601-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1050-4729"}],"articleNumber":"4209834","dbTime":"20 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":171},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Welding","Manipulators","Robot motion","Steel","Sampling methods","Iterative algorithms","Robot sensing systems","Robotic assembly","Robotics and automation","Motion planning"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["manipulators","motion control","path planning","shipbuilding industry","welding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["motion planning","gantry mounted manipulators","ship welding","roadmap based planner","robot motions","Odense steel shipyard","random sampling"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Motion planning for gantry mounted manipulators: A ship-welding application example","doi":"10.1109/ROBOT.2007.364216","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4209049","endPage":"4786","publicationTitle":"Proceedings 2007 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings 2007 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel5/4209048/4209049/04209834.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ROBOT.2007.364216","startPage":"4782","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4209834","abstract":"We present a roadmap based planner for finding robot motions for gantry mounted manipulators for a line welding application at Odense steel shipyard (OSS).

The system consists of two sets of silicon retinas and simple cell chips that correspond to the binocular vision and field programmable gate array (FPGA) circuit. This arrangement mimics the hierarchical architecture of the visual system of the brain. The silicon retina is an analog very large scale integrated (aVLSI) circuit and possesses a Laplacian-Gaussian-like spatial filter similar to the receptive field of the vertebrate retina. The simple cell chip generates a Gabor-like spatial filter similar to the orientation-selective receptive field of the simple cell in V1 by aggregating several pixels of the silicon retina. The FPGA receives the outputs from the two simple cell chips corresponding to binocular inputs from the left and right eyes and calculates the binocular disparity in real-time based on the disparity energy model. The system provides output images tuned to five different disparities in parallel. The disparity map is obtained by comparing these disparity energy outputs. Due to the combination of the parallel and analog computation of the aVLSIs and the pixel-wise computation with hard-wired digital circuits, the present system can efficiently compute the binocular disparity using compact hardware and low power dissipation in real-time.","doi":"10.1109/ROBOT.2007.364229","publicationTitle":"Proceedings 2007 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings 2007 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel5/4209048/4209049/04209847.pdf","startPage":"4867","endPage":"4872","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ROBOT.2007.364229","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4209049","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Neuromorphic binocular vision system for real-time disparity estimation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4209847","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-14 April 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4209847/","displayDocTitle":"Neuromorphic binocular vision system for real-time disparity estimation","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2007","accessionNumber":"9538303","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4209847/","conferenceDate":"10-14 April 2007","dateOfInsertion":"21 May 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Neuromorphic binocular vision system for real-time disparity estimation","confLoc":"Rome, Italy","sourcePdf":"ROBOT-00-798.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.083341S","chronDate":"10-14 April 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4209048","isNumber":"4209049","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4209048","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"4209049","articleId":"4209847","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4209864,"authors":[{"name":"Koichi Suzumori","affiliation":["Okayama University, Tsushima, Okayama, Japan"],"firstName":"Koichi","lastName":"Suzumori","id":"37283170500"},{"name":"Satoshi Endo","affiliation":["Okayama University, Tsushima, Okayama, Japan"],"firstName":"Satoshi","lastName":"Endo","id":"37342057500"},{"name":"Takefumi Kanda","affiliation":["Okayama University, Tsushima, Okayama, Japan"],"firstName":"Takefumi","lastName":"Kanda","id":"37273968800"},{"name":"Naomi Kato","affiliation":["Osaka University, Japan"],"firstName":"Naomi","lastName":"Kato","id":"37341688300"},{"name":"Hiroyoshi Suzuki","affiliation":["Osaka University, Japan"],"firstName":"Hiroyoshi","lastName":"Suzuki","id":"37593040600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0602-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0601-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1050-4729"}],"articleNumber":"4209864","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":164,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":5523},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Rubber","Pneumatic actuators","Robots","Prototypes","Finite element methods","Design methodology","Fabrication","Design automation","Computer aided manufacturing","CADCAM"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biomimetics","finite element analysis","mobile robots","pneumatic actuators","underwater vehicles"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bending pneumatic rubber actuator","soft-bodied manta swimming robot","optimal design","nonlinear finite element method","geometrical nonlinearity","material nonlinearity","CAD-CAM based rubber molding process"]}],"abstract":"This paper shows a new design and prototyping method for a bending pneumatic rubber actuator and its application to a soft-bodied manta swimming robot.

We propose a framework for modeling transient-error tolerance (TET) in logic circuits.

We introduce a metric called the critical soft-error rate (CSER) as an alternative to conventional SER, and present some analysis strategies based on CSER. This approach employs a new single transient fault (STF) model, which is defined in terms of a temporary stuck-at fault and its associated circuit state. Although basically technology-independent, STFs can be extended with low-level physical attributes. With STFs, we can estimate the transient error probability p\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">err</sub>\n of a circuit's nodes, as well as various measures of error susceptibility and TET.

This is in contrast to classical error detection where a failure is detected after errors appear in system data and states. Circuit failure prediction is performed during system operation by analyzing the data collected by sensors inserted at various locations inside a chip. We demonstrate this concept of circuit failure prediction for a dominant PMOS aging mechanism induced by negative bias temperature instability (NBTI). NBTI-induced PMOS aging slows down PMOS transistors over time. As a result, the speed of a chip can significantly degrade over time and can result in delay faults. The traditional practice is to incorporate worst-case speed margins to prevent delay faults during system operation due to NBTI aging. A new sensor design integrated inside a flip-flop enables efficient circuit failure prediction at a low cost. Simulation results using 90nm and 65nm technologies demonstrate that this technique can significantly improve system performance by enabling close to best-case design instead of traditional worst-case design.","doi":"10.1109/VTS.2007.22","publicationTitle":"25th IEEE VLSI Test Symposium (VTS'07)","displayPublicationTitle":"25th IEEE VLSI Test Symposium (VTS'07)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4209869/4209870/04209925.pdf","startPage":"277","endPage":"286","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4209870","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VTS.2007.22","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Circuit Failure Prediction and Its Application to Transistor Aging","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4209925","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-10 May 2007","displayDocTitle":"Circuit Failure Prediction and Its Application to Transistor Aging","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4209925/","publicationDate":"May 2007","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"21 May 2007","accessionNumber":"9518545","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4209925/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"6-10 May 2007","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Circuit Failure Prediction and Its Application to Transistor Aging","confLoc":"Berkeley, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"28120277.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.083955S","chronDate":"6-10 May 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4209869","isNumber":"4209870","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4209869","citationCount":"313","xplore-issue":"4209870","articleId":"4209925","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4209937,"authors":[{"name":"Avijit Dutta","affiliation":["Computer Engineering Research Center, University of Technology, Austin, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Avijit","lastName":"Dutta","id":"37417152200"},{"name":"Nur A.

As memory density increases, multiple bit upsets in nearby cells become more frequent. A methodology is proposed here for deriving an error correcting code through heuristic search that can detect and correct the most likely double bit errors in a memory while minimizing the miscorrection probability of the unlikely double bit errors. A key feature of the proposed ECC is that it uses the same number of check bits as the conventional single error correcting/double error detecting (SEC-DED) codes commonly used, and has nearly identical syndrome generator/encoder area and timing overhead. Hence, there is very little additional cost to using the proposed ECC. The proposed ECC can be used instead of or in addition to bit interleaving to provide greater flexibility for optimizing a memory layout and/or provide better protection from multiple bit upsets.

From manufacturing data, we show that in some cases, a resistive-open defect may lead to a new type of dynamic behavior which has never been experienced in the past. This faulty behavior can be modeled as an un-restored destructive write fault (URDWF). Such URDWF is a consequence of the structural dependencies that exist between the write driver and the sense amplifier, and appears when a specific read operation is performed immediately after a specific write operation. Results of electrical simulations are presented to give a complete understanding of such a faulty behavior and to highlight the difference with a standard un-restored write fault (URWF) model. Next, a possible March test solution is presented to detect URDWF. Finally, a discussion is proposed on the opportunity to include new features in this part of the memory to easily distinguish between faults coming from the write driver (like URDWF) and those coming from other parts of the memory (sense amplifier, core-cells, etc.)","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Un-Restored Destructive Write Faults Due to Resistive-Open Defects in the Write Driver of SRAMs","doi":"10.1109/VTS.2007.84","startPage":"361","endPage":"368","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VTS.2007.84","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4209870","publicationTitle":"25th IEEE VLSI Test Symposium (VTS'07)","displayPublicationTitle":"25th IEEE VLSI Test Symposium (VTS'07)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4209869/4209870/04209939.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4209939","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4209939/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-10 May 2007","displayDocTitle":"Un-Restored Destructive Write Faults Due to Resistive-Open Defects in the Write Driver of SRAMs","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4209939/","dateOfInsertion":"21 May 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2007","accessionNumber":"9507993","conferenceDate":"6-10 May 2007","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Un-Restored Destructive Write Faults Due to Resistive-Open Defects in the Write Driver of SRAMs","confLoc":"Berkeley, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"28120361.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041176S","chronDate":"6-10 May 2007","isNumber":"4209870","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4209869","citationCount":"2","articleId":"4209939","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4209944,"authors":[{"name":"Rajarajan Senguttuvan","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"firstName":"Rajarajan","lastName":"Senguttuvan","id":"37408292800"},{"name":"Abhijit Chatterjee","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"firstName":"Abhijit","lastName":"Chatterjee","id":"37273696200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7695-2812-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1093-0167"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2375-1053"}],"articleNumber":"4209944","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":12,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":134},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Testing","Radio frequency","Transmitters","Predistortion","Baseband","Operational amplifiers","Power amplifiers","Radiofrequency amplifiers","Feeds","Envelope detectors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["integrated circuit testing","low noise amplifiers","mixers (circuits)","power amplifiers","radio transmitters","radiocommunication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["alternate diagnostic testing","RF transmitter","response detection","digital predistortion","compensation technique","communication systems","power amplifier nonlinearity","linearization schemes","baseband processor","predistortion coefficients","RF communication","mixer","LNA","PA","multisine diagnostic test","response envelope detector","response diagnosis"]}],"abstract":"Digital predistortion is used as a compensation technique in communication systems to minimize the effect of power amplifier non-linearity while increasing its operational efficiency. Prior linearization schemes use the receiver chain to feed data to the baseband processor that adaptively adjusts the predistortion coefficients. The procedure is iterative, requires many test applications, is sensitive to receiver quality, and is not suitable for RF communication front ends in which the mixer, LNA and PA are dynamically reconfigured to adapt to changing operating conditions. In the proposed scheme, a single multi-sine diagnostic test is applied from the baseband, and the response of the transmitter is captured via a response envelope detector. A novel unified methodology for co-tuning predistortion coefficients along with the PA bias voltage based on response diagnosis is proposed, thereby, enabling the transmitter to operate at high efficiency and linearity.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Alternate Diagnostic Testing and Compensation of RF Transmitter Performance Using Response Detection","publicationTitle":"25th IEEE VLSI Test Symposium (VTS'07)","doi":"10.1109/VTS.2007.12","displayPublicationTitle":"25th IEEE VLSI Test Symposium (VTS'07)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4209869/4209870/04209944.pdf","startPage":"395","endPage":"400","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VTS.2007.12","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4209870","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4209944","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4209944/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-10 May 2007","displayDocTitle":"Alternate Diagnostic Testing and Compensation of RF Transmitter Performance Using Response Detection","conferenceDate":"6-10 May 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4209944/","dateOfInsertion":"21 May 2007","publicationDate":"May 2007","accessionNumber":"9518555","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Alternate Diagnostic Testing and Compensation of RF Transmitter Performance Using Response Detection","confLoc":"Berkeley, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"28120395.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.090258S","chronDate":"6-10 May 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4209869","isNumber":"4209870","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4209869","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"4209870","articleId":"4209944","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4209945,"authors":[{"name":"Yen-Chih Huang","affiliation":["Graduate Institute of Electronics Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Yen-Chih","lastName":"Huang","id":"37694673600"},{"name":"Hsieh-Hung Hsieh","affiliation":["Graduate Institute of Electronics Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Hsieh-Hung","lastName":"Hsieh","id":"37286034000"},{"name":"Liang-Hung Lu","affiliation":["Graduate Institute of Electronics Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Liang-Hung","lastName":"Lu","id":"37292645400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7695-2812-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1093-0167"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2375-1053"}],"articleNumber":"4209945","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":21,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":413},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4209945","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Low-noise amplifiers","Radio frequency","Built-in self-test","Circuit testing","Calibration","Performance gain","Switches","System-on-a-chip","Degradation","Radiofrequency integrated circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["built-in self test","CMOS integrated circuits","electric current measurement","integrated circuit testing","low noise amplifiers","radiofrequency amplifiers","sensors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["RF low-noise amplifier","CMOS current sensors","CMOS power sensors","RF built-in self-test","on-chip sensors","circuit parameters","dc current","forward gain","gain compression","device under test","5 GHz","0.18 micron"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, the design and experimental results of the fully integrated CMOS current sensors and power sensors for RF built-in self-test (BIST) applications are presented.

Experimental results show that the proposed approach entails significantly lesser design overhead (~5times reduction in number of additional gates) with comparable or better protection against attack than existing techniques.","doi":"10.1109/VTS.2007.89","publicationTitle":"25th IEEE VLSI Test Symposium (VTS'07)","displayPublicationTitle":"25th IEEE VLSI Test Symposium (VTS'07)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4209869/4209870/04209953.pdf","startPage":"455","endPage":"460","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VTS.2007.89","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4209870","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"VIm-Scan: A Low Overhead Scan Design Approach for Protection of Secret Key in Scan-Based Secure Chips","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4209953","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-10 May 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4209953/","displayDocTitle":"VIm-Scan: A Low Overhead Scan Design Approach for Protection of Secret Key in Scan-Based Secure Chips","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2007","accessionNumber":"9529916","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4209953/","conferenceDate":"6-10 May 2007","dateOfInsertion":"21 May 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"VIm-Scan: A Low Overhead Scan Design Approach for Protection of Secret Key in Scan-Based Secure Chips","confLoc":"Berkeley, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"28120455.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064097S","chronDate":"6-10 May 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4209869","isNumber":"4209870","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4209869","citationCount":"69","xplore-issue":"4209870","articleId":"4209953","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4209954,"authors":[{"name":"Chunsheng Liu","affiliation":["Computer and Electronic Engineering, University of Nebraska, Lincoln, Omaha, NE, USA"],"firstName":"Chunsheng","lastName":"Liu","id":"37280619600"},{"name":"Yu Huang","affiliation":["Mentor Graphics Corporation, Marlborough, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Yu","lastName":"Huang","id":"37278782600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7695-2812-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1093-0167"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2375-1053"}],"articleNumber":"4209954","dbTime":"24 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":28,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":221},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Compaction","Circuit testing","Cryptography","Information security","Hardware","Observability","Controllability","Protection","Information retrieval","Logic testing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["automatic testing","cryptography","embedded systems","logic testing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["embedded decompression","side-channel attack resistance","security-related applications","embedded compression architectures","compaction circuit","attacking strategy","embedded deterministic testing","probabilistic analysis","distance coding"]}],"abstract":"Attack resistance has been a critical concern for security-related applications. Various side-channel attacks can he launched to retrieve security information such as encryption key. Prior work does not consider the presence of embedded compression architectures and their impacts on security. This paper analyzes the complexity of side-channel attacking on designs with embedded decompression and compaction circuit. A possible attacking strategy was first presented and performs analysis on the complexity of attacking circuits with EDT architecture. The probabilistic analysis was then extended to the more general compaction schemes using distance coding. The authors have shown that successful attacking of designs with embedded decompressor and compactor is extremely difficult. The complexity is much higher than the results shown in prior work assuming no decompression and compaction. It indicates that the use of embedded compression architectures can achieve higher security level.","doi":"10.1109/VTS.2007.29","publicationTitle":"25th IEEE VLSI Test Symposium (VTS'07)","displayPublicationTitle":"25th IEEE VLSI Test Symposium (VTS'07)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4209869/4209870/04209954.pdf","startPage":"461","endPage":"468","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VTS.2007.29","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4209870","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Effects of Embedded Decompression and Compaction Architectures on Side-Channel Attack Resistance","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4209954","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-10 May 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4209954/","displayDocTitle":"Effects of Embedded Decompression and Compaction Architectures on Side-Channel Attack Resistance","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2007","accessionNumber":"9518560","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4209954/","conferenceDate":"6-10 May 2007","dateOfInsertion":"21 May 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Effects of Embedded Decompression and Compaction Architectures on Side-Channel Attack Resistance","confLoc":"Berkeley, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"28120461.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064489S","chronDate":"6-10 May 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4209869","isNumber":"4209870","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4209869","citationCount":"28","xplore-issue":"4209870","articleId":"4209954","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"}]
