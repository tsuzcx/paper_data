The voltage-controlled magnetic anisotropy (VCMA) effect is utilized to back up the latched data into MTJs before the power supply is turned off. Switching an MTJ through the VCMA effect does not require a dedicated write circuit for data backup, resulting in reduced area as compared with NVFFs exploiting the spin transfer torque (STT) switching mechanism. In a VCMA-based NVFF, the MTJs are coherently switched, enabling ultra-energy efficient data backup with subnanosecond backup time. Simulation results exhibit more than a 342\u00d7 (33.7\u00d7) improvement in data backup energy per bit, and more than 35.5\u00d7 (7.7\u00d7) improvement in data backup delay per bit as compared with the most efficient STT-based NVFFs (spin Hall effect-based NVFF). The energy efficiency of the VCMA-based NVFF results in sufficiently short breakeven times, enabling effective fine-grain power gating.","doi":"10.1109/TCSII.2015.2468931","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express

(PCF), we observe the generation of soliton and four-wave mixing (FWM) when the femtosecond pulse is pumped at 0.822 \u03bcm, belonging to the normal-dispersion regime. It is generally acknowledged that FWM is unrelated to third-order dispersion, whereas we use the fourth-order Runge-Kutta method to simulate the PCF properties by taking into account the third-order dispersion or not; the result we got is different from the conventional one. The numerical simulations are greatly consistent with the experiment results, and the FWM is dominated by negative fourth-order and negative sixth-order dispersion in the experiment. The main dynamic process is explained as the soliton, and the FWM generation can be induced by third-order dispersion. We indicate that low Raman threshold has played a very active role in this process, and we propose a conception of stimulated FWM effect in this paper.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Soliton and Four-Wave Mixing Effects Induced by the Third-Order Dispersion in a Photonic Crystal Fiber With Femtosecond Pulses Pumping at Normal-Dispersion Regime","publicationTitle":"IEEE Photonics Journal","doi":"10.1109/JPHOT.2015.2468673","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Photonics Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/4563994/7222813/07202811.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"11","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JPHOT.2015.2468673","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7222813","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7202811","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7202811/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 August 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2015","displayDocTitle":"Soliton and Four-Wave Mixing Effects Induced by the Third-Order Dispersion in a Photonic Crystal Fiber With Femtosecond Pulses Pumping at Normal-Dispersion Regime","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"7","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/7202811/","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","isOpenAccess":true,"externalId":"3200211","publicationDate":"Oct. 2015","accessionNumber":"15413831","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61178026 and 61475134"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003787","fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of Hebei Province, China","grantNumber":"E2012203035"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Soliton and Four-Wave Mixing Effects Induced by the Third-Order Dispersion in a Photonic Crystal Fiber With Femtosecond Pulses Pumping at Normal-Dispersion Regime","sourcePdf":"jphot-li-2468673-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.108716S","chronDate":"Oct.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"4563994","isNumber":"7222813","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4563994","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"7222813","articleId":"7202811","onlineDate":"14 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7202833,"authors":[{"name":"Ali Afana","affiliation":["Faculty of Engineering and Applied Science, Memorial University, St. John's, NL, Canada"],"firstName":"Ali","lastName":"Afana","id":"38469714700"},{"name":"Telex M.

Methods: An adaptive implementation of 1-D convolutional neural networks (CNNs) is inherently used to fuse the two major blocks of the ECG classification into a single learning body: feature extraction and classification. Therefore, for each patient, an individual and simple CNN will be trained by using relatively small common and patient-specific training data, and thus, such patient-specific feature extraction ability can further improve the classification performance. Since this also negates the necessity to extract hand-crafted manual features, once a dedicated CNN is trained for a particular patient, it can solely be used to classify possibly long ECG data stream in a fast and accurate manner or alternatively, such a solution can conveniently be used for real-time ECG monitoring and early alert system on a light-weight wearable device. Results: The results over the MIT-BIH arrhythmia benchmark database demonstrate that the proposed solution achieves a superior classification performance than most of the state-of-the-art methods for the detection of ventricular ectopic beats and supraventricular ectopic beats. Conclusion: Besides the speed and computational efficiency achieved, once a dedicated CNN is trained for an individual patient, it can solely be used to classify his/her long ECG records such as Holter registers in a fast and accurate manner. Significance: Due to its simple and parameter invariant nature, the proposed system is highly generic, and, thus, applicable to any ECG dataset.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7202837/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 August 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2016","volume":"63","issue":"3","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"15802413","pubMedId":"26285054","dateOfInsertion":"18 February 2016","publicationDate":"March 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7202837/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Real-Time Patient-Specific ECG Classification by 1-D Convolutional Neural Networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Real-Time Patient-Specific ECG Classification by 1-D Convolutional Neural Networks","sourcePdf":"tbme-kiranyaz-2468589-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.066253S","chronDate":"March  2016","xplore-pub-id":"10","isNumber":"7412788","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"651","xplore-issue":"7412788","articleId":"7202837","onlineDate":"14 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-26"},{"_id":7202838,"authors":[{"name":"Jun Fu","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Synthetical Automation for Process Industries, Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), Cambridge, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Jun","lastName":"Fu","id":"37085385106"},{"name":"Tianyou Chai","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Synthetical Automation for Process Industries, Northeastern University, Shenyang, China"],"firstName":"Tianyou","lastName":"Chai","id":"37268730400"},{"name":"Ying Jin","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Synthetical Automation for Process Industries, Northeastern University, Shenyang, China"],"firstName":"Ying","lastName":"Jin","id":"38548564100"},{"name":"Chun-Yi Su","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical Engineering, Concordia University, Montreal, QC, Canada"],"firstName":"Chun-Yi","lastName":"Su","id":"37085666019"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1549-7747"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-3791"}],"articleNumber":"7202838","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":29,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":627},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Circuits and Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieee-cas.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Actuators","Switches","Haptic interfaces","Uncertainty","Circuit faults","Virtual environments"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fault tolerant control","Lyapunov methods","nonlinear control systems","switching systems (control)","uncertain systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fault-tolerant control","structural uncertainties","uncertain switched nonlinear systems","partial actuator failures","Lyapunov function technique","haptic display systems","actuator fault modes","switching policies","switched virtual environments"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Switched systems","Fault-tolerant control","Uncertainties"]},{"kwd":["Fault-tolerant control","switched systems","uncertainties"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7202838","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs","pdfPath":"/iel7/8920/7394206/07202838.pdf","startPage":"201","endPage":"205","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSII.2015.2468916","doi":"10.1109/TCSII.2015.2468916","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7394206","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fault-Tolerant Control of a Class of Switched Nonlinear Systems With Structural Uncertainties","abstract":"This brief considers fault-tolerant control of a class of uncertain switched nonlinear systems against partial actuator failures.

We consider the worst case signal-to-interference-plus-noise-ratio (SINR) at the output of the filter bank as the figure of merit to optimize under both a similarity and an energy constraint on the transmit signal. Based on a suitable reformulation of the original non-convex max-min optimization problem, we develop an optimization procedure which monotonically improves the worst-case SINR and converges to a stationary point. Each iteration of the algorithm, involves both a convex and a generalized fractional programming problem which can be globally solved via the generalized Dinkelbach's procedure with a polynomial computational complexity. Finally, at the analysis stage, we assess the performance of the new technique versus some counterparts which are available in open literature.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimizing Radar Waveform and Doppler Filter Bank via Generalized Fractional Programming","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/JSTSP.2015.2469259","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/4200690/7327073/07202844.pdf","startPage":"1387","endPage":"1399","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSTSP.2015.2469259","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7327073","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7202844","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7202844/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 August 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2015","displayDocTitle":"Optimizing Radar Waveform and Doppler Filter Bank via Generalized Fractional Programming","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"9","issue":"8","dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2015","publicationDate":"Dec. 2015","accessionNumber":"15676870","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimizing Radar Waveform and Doppler Filter Bank via Generalized Fractional Programming","sourcePdf":"jstsp-demaio-2469259-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.045087S","chronDate":"Dec.  2015","isNumber":"7327073","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4200690","citationCount":"93","articleId":"7202844","onlineDate":"14 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7202845,"authors":[{"name":"Yibo Fan","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of ASIC & System, Fudan University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Yibo","lastName":"Fan","id":"37966314700"},{"name":"Leilei Huang","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of ASIC & System, Fudan University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Leilei","lastName":"Huang","id":"37085613467"},{"name":"Yufeng Bai","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of ASIC & System, Fudan University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Yufeng","lastName":"Bai","id":"37085512016"},{"name":"Xiaoyang Zeng","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of ASIC & System, Fudan University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Xiaoyang","lastName":"Zeng","id":"37288001700"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1549-7747"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-3791"}],"articleNumber":"7202845","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":472},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Circuits and Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieee-cas.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Discrete cosine transforms","Throughput","Registers","Logic gates","Random access memory","Hardware","Computer architecture"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["discrete cosine transforms","electronic data interchange","inverse transforms","parallel processing","SRAM chips","video coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["parallel-access mapping method","data exchange buffers","IDCT","HEVC encoders","single-port SRAM","transform unit","inversed discrete cosine transform","data exchange method","parallel-access data mapping method","single-port static random access memory devices","high-throughput data exchange","high efficiency video coding"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["data mapping method","buffer","discrete cosine transform (DCT)","inversed discrete cosine transform (IDCT)","high efficiency video coding (HEVC)"]},{"kwd":["Buffer","data mapping method","discrete cosine transform (DCT)","High Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC)","inversed discrete cosine transform (IDCT)","single-port static random access memory"]}],"abstract":"In the High Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC) standard, a notation of the transform unit (TU) is introduced with four different sizes, i.e., 4 \u00d7 4, 8 \u00d7 8, 16 \u00d7 16, and 32 \u00d7 32, which results in at least two problems in the use of discrete cosine transform/inversed discrete cosine transform (DCT/IDCT).

Multivariate filters can be used to isolate an ERP component of interest without the averaging procedure. However, we would like to have certainty that the output of the filter accurately represents the component. Methods: We extended the linearly constrained minimum variance (LCMV) beamformer, which is traditionally used as a spatial filter for source localization, to be a flexible spatiotemporal filter for estimating the amplitude of ERP components in sensor space. In a comparison study on both simulated and real data, we demonstrated the strengths and weaknesses of the beamformer as well as a range of supervised learning approaches. Results: In the context of measuring the amplitude of a specific ERP component on a single-trial basis, we found that the spatiotemporal LCMV beamformer is a filter that accurately captures the component of interest, even in the presence of both structured noise (e.g., other overlapping ERP components) and unstructured noise (e.g., ongoing brain activity and sensor noise). Conclusion: The spatiotemporal LCMV beamformer method provides an accurate and intuitive way to conduct analysis of a known ERP component, without averaging across trials or subjects. Significance: Eliminating averaging allows us to test more detailed hypotheses and apply more powerful statistical models. For example, it allows the usage of multilevel regression models that can incorporate between subject/stimulus variation as random effects, test multiple effects simultaneously, and control confounding effects by partial regression.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TBME.2015.2468588","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7360844","startPage":"55","endPage":"66","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel7/10/7360844/07202846.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Single-Trial ERP Component Analysis Using a Spatiotemporal LCMV Beamformer","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7202846/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 August 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7202846/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Single-Trial ERP Component Analysis Using a Spatiotemporal LCMV Beamformer","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2016","accessionNumber":"15669082","pubMedId":"26285053","dateOfInsertion":"18 December 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"63","issue":"1","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Interuniversity Attraction Poles Programme Belgian Science Policy","grantNumber":"IUAP P7/11"},{"fundingName":"interdisciplinary research project","grantNumber":"IDO/12/007"},{"fundingName":"industrial research fund project","grantNumber":"IOF/HB/12/021"},{"fundingName":"Financing program","grantNumber":"PFV/10/008"},{"fundingName":"Belgian Fund for Scientific Research at Flanders","grantNumber":"G.0436.13, G.0883.14N and G.0A09.14N"},{"fundingName":"UGent MRP \u201cThe integrative neuroscience of behavioral control\u201d"},{"fundingName":"Flemish Regional Ministry of Education (Belgium)","grantNumber":"GOA 10/019"},{"fundingName":"Flemish Agency for Innovation by Science and Technology (TETRA project Spellbinder)"},{"fundingName":"SWIFT prize of the King Baudouin Foundation of Belgium"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Single-Trial ERP Component Analysis Using a Spatiotemporal LCMV Beamformer","sourcePdf":"tbme-vanvliet-2468588-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.088991S","chronDate":"Jan.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"10","isNumber":"7360844","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"7360844","articleId":"7202846","onlineDate":"14 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7202852,"authors":[{"name":"Chi-Shuen Lee","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/16/7210242/7202852/lee-2457424-small.gif","p":["Chi-Shuen Lee received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering from National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan, in 2011, and the M.S. degree in electrical engineering from Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA, in 2014, where he is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree.","His current research interests include modeling and simulation of nanoscale MOSFETs and CMOS technology assessment and benchmarking."]},"firstName":"Chi-Shuen","lastName":"Lee","id":"38667644300"},{"name":"Eric Pop","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/16/7210242/7202852/pop-2457424-small.gif","p":["Eric Pop (M\u201999\u2013SM\u201911) received the B.S. and M.S. degrees from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, USA, and the Ph.D. degree from Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA.","He was with the University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign, Urbana, IL, USA, from 2007 to 2013.

corrector (DCC) of a delay locked loop (DLL) to increase the range of allowed input duty cycle. The feedback edge combiner generates the rising edge of a DCC output at the rising edge of an input clock. It generates the falling edge of the DCC output at the rising edge of a feedback clock that is a half-period-delayed signal of the DCC output. A dual-delay-line digitally controlled delay line (DCDL) is used for seamless boundary switching. The chip area of the DCDL is reduced by around 46% by employing the architecture of two short coarse delay lines followed by a fine phase mixer (FPM) and a long coarse delay line in series instead of the architecture of two long coarse delay lines followed by an FPM. The measurements on the chip fabricated in the 65-nm CMOS show the allowed input duty cycle in the range from 20% to 80%; root-mean-square and peak-to-peak jitters of 2.69 and 14.0 ps, respectively, at 2 GHz and 1.2 V; and the operating frequency range from 0.12 to 2.0 GHz at 1.2 V. The measured power consumption is 3.3 mW/GHz at 1.2 V.

However, integrating multiple types of storage comes with several implementation challenges.

With the growing complexity of real-world dynamic scenarios, more and more symbols are often needed to encode the sequential values. This is so-called \u201ccurse of cardinality\u201d, which can impose significant challenges to the design of sequential analysis methods in terms of computational efficiency and practical use. Indeed, given the overwhelming scale and the heterogeneous nature of the sequential data, new visions and strategies are needed to face the challenges. To this end, in this paper, we propose a \u201ctemporal skeletonization\u201d approach to proactively reduce the cardinality of the representation for sequences by uncovering significant, hidden temporal structures. The key idea is to summarize the temporal correlations in an undirected graph, and use the \u201cskeleton\u201d of the graph as a higher granularity on which hidden temporal patterns are more likely to be identified. As a consequence, the embedding topology of the graph allows us to translate the rich temporal content into a metric space. This opens up new possibilities to explore, quantify, and visualize sequential data. Our approach has shown to greatly alleviate the curse of cardinality in challenging tasks of sequential pattern mining and clustering. Evaluation on a business-to-business (B2B) marketing application demonstrates that our approach can effectively discover critical buying paths from noisy customer event data.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7347496","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel7/69/7347496/07202877.pdf","doi":"10.1109/TKDE.2015.2468715","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TKDE.2015.2468715","startPage":"211","endPage":"223","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Temporal Skeletonization on Sequential Data: Patterns, Categorization, and Visualization","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 August 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan. 1 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7202877/","displayDocTitle":"Temporal Skeletonization on Sequential Data: Patterns, Categorization, and Visualization","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7202877/","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"28","issue":"1","accessionNumber":"15676638","dateOfInsertion":"04 December 2015","publicationDate":"1 Jan. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Rutgers 2015 Chancellor\u2019s Seed"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"71028002"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Temporal Skeletonization on Sequential Data: Patterns, Categorization, and Visualization","sourcePdf":"tkde-liu-2468715-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.131032S","chronDate":"Jan. 1 2016","xplore-pub-id":"69","isNumber":"7347496","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"69","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"7347496","articleId":"7202877","onlineDate":"14 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7202878,"authors":[{"name":"Dawei Li","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Advanced Electromagnetic Engineering and Technology, School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/60/7410138/7202878/li-small.gif","p":["Dawei Li (S'12) was born in China.

First, analytical expressions for air-gap flux density distribution, back-electromagnetic force (EMF), and torque are developed to analyze the electromagnetic features of FSPM machines. It is found that the conventional winding theory, such as star of slots, can be directly employed to analyze FSPM machines without any modification. Combinations of stator and rotor teeth, winding connection, and conditions for symmetrical-phase back-EMF waveform are analyzed and obtained using star of slots. The armature winding pole pairs of FSPM machines are redefined. Based on this new concept and the proposed analytical expressions, slots per phase per pole and winding factor in FSPM machines are derived, a new type winding configuration with overlapping windings for FSPM machines is predicted and verified to be with ~90% larger back EMF than those of conventional FSPM machines with nonoverlapping windings. All these analysis results are validated by finite element analyzes.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Geoscience"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7202878/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 August 2015","volume":"31","issue":"1","accessionNumber":"15787036","publicationDate":"March 2016","dateOfInsertion":"18 February 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7202878/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Synthesis of Flux Switching Permanent Magnet Machines","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"51337004 and 51407082"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Synthesis of Flux Switching Permanent Magnet Machines","sourcePdf":"tec-qu-2458312-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.099661S","chronDate":"March  2016","xplore-pub-id":"60","isNumber":"7410138","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"60","citationCount":"89","xplore-issue":"7410138","articleId":"7202878","onlineDate":"14 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":7202887,"authors":[{"name":"Kyungmin Na","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology, Ulsan, South Korea"],"firstName":"Kyungmin","lastName":"Na","id":"37085362706"},{"name":"Heedon Jang","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology, Ulsan, South Korea"],"firstName":"Heedon","lastName":"Jang","id":"37085358332"},{"name":"Hyunggun Ma","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology, Ulsan, South Korea"],"firstName":"Hyunggun","lastName":"Ma","id":"37085366975"},{"name":"Yunho Choi","affiliation":["Hyundai Autron, Mtek IT Tower, Seongnam-si, South Korea"],"firstName":"Yunho","lastName":"Choi","id":"37595911100"},{"name":"Franklin Bien","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology, Ulsan, South Korea"],"firstName":"Franklin","lastName":"Bien","id":"37284889300"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1549-7747"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-3791"}],"articleNumber":"7202887","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":21,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":698},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Circuits and Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieee-cas.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Pulse generation","Delays","Bandwidth","Logic gates","Computer architecture","CMOS integrated circuits","Wireless communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["amplitude shift keying","body area networks","logic gates","phase shift keying","pulse generators","pulse position modulation","ultra wideband communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["DB-BPSK modulation","all-digital impulse radio ultrawideband pulse generator","technology","wireless body area network","delay-based pulse generator","logic gate","pulse positioned modulation","on-off keying","delay-based binary phase shift keying","spectral line characteristic","bit rate 200 Mbit/s","frequency 3.1 GHz to 4.8 GHz","bandwidth 500 MHz","bit rate 100 Mbit/s","voltage 1.2 V","size 65 nm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Impulse radio ultra-wideband (IR-UWB)","transmitter","pulse generator","wireless body area network (WBAN)"]},{"kwd":["Impulse radio ultrawideband (IR-UWB)","pulse generator","transmitter","wireless body area network (WBAN)"]}],"abstract":"A new all-digital impulse radio ultrawideband pulse generator in a 65-nm CMOS technology for a wireless body area network is presented.

VSynC, different from the conventional synchronization method based on phase-locked-loop (PLL) synchronizing technique, makes DFIG-based WT synchronize with power grid via the active power control (APC), and thus provide the desired inertial support to power grid. Further, an effective approach for describing the inertial dynamics of DFIG-based WT with VSynC is proposed by establishing the WT's electromechanical motion equation. The approach synthetically considers the impacts of the WT's different controller parameters, operating points, and, in particular, the variations of mechanical power caused by the rotational speed or pitch angle changes during the inertial response period. It also makes the essential of DFIG-based WT's inertia clearer, which, as a matter of fact, is controllable and manifests frequency-dependent characteristics, and noticeably differs from the fixed inertia time constant featured in synchronous generator (SG). The impacts of different controller parameters and operating points on single WT's frequency response characteristics are studied. Simulated results also validate the superiority of VSynC on inertial support capability and operation stability to the typical PLL-based vector control (VC), especially for weak grid conditions. Finally, the frequency response on wind power plant (WPP) level is initially explored and further research to improve VSynC is discussed.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7333020","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion","pdfPath":"/iel7/60/7333020/07202890.pdf","doi":"10.1109/TEC.2015.2460262","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TEC.2015.2460262","startPage":"1691","endPage":"1702","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On Inertial Dynamics of Virtual-Synchronous-Controlled DFIG-Based Wind Turbines","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Geoscience"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 August 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7202890/","displayDocTitle":"On Inertial Dynamics of Virtual-Synchronous-Controlled DFIG-Based Wind Turbines","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7202890/","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"30","issue":"4","accessionNumber":"15602854","dateOfInsertion":"20 November 2015","publicationDate":"Dec. 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"National Basic Research Program of China","grantNumber":"2012CB215100"},{"fundingName":"National Natural Science Fund for Excellent Young Scholars","grantNumber":"51322704"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"Major Program of National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"51190104"},{"fundingName":"Science and Technology Program of State Grid Corporation of China"},{"fundingName":"Techniques and Applications of Static Synchronous Generator"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On Inertial Dynamics of Virtual-Synchronous-Controlled DFIG-Based Wind Turbines","sourcePdf":"tec-hu-2460262-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.083203S","chronDate":"Dec.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"60","isNumber":"7333020","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"60","citationCount":"119","xplore-issue":"7333020","articleId":"7202890","onlineDate":"14 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7202893,"authors":[{"name":"Jonathan Scarlett","affiliation":["Laboratory for Information and Inference Systems, \u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland"],"bio":{"p":["Jonathan Scarlett (S\u201914\u2013M\u201915) was born in Melbourne, Australia, in 1988.

In this article, we study the orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP) algorithm for the recovery of support under noise. We consider two signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) settings: 1) the SNR depends on the sparsity level K of input signals, and 2) the SNR is an absolute constant independent of K. For the first setting, we establish necessary and sufficient conditions for the exact support recovery with OMP, expressed as lower bounds on the SNR. Our results indicate that in order to ensure the exact support recovery of all K-sparse signals with the OMP algorithm, the SNR must at least scale linearly with the sparsity level K. In the second setting, since the necessary condition on the SNR is not fulfilled, the exact support recovery with OMP is impossible. However, our analysis shows that recovery with an arbitrarily small but constant fraction of errors is possible with the OMP algorithm. This result may be useful for some practical applications where obtaining some large fraction of support positions is adequate.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2015.2468676","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/78/7273734/07202899.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2015.2468676","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7273734","startPage":"5868","endPage":"5877","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Support Recovery With Orthogonal Matching Pursuit in the Presence of Noise","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7202899","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Support Recovery With Orthogonal Matching Pursuit in the Presence of Noise","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.1,  2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7202899/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 August 2015","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"63","issue":"21","publicationDate":"Nov.1, 2015","accessionNumber":"15484798","dateOfInsertion":"02 October 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7202899/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000183","fundingName":"ARO"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000185","fundingName":"DARPA"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000015","fundingName":"DOE"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000266","fundingName":"NGA"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000006","fundingName":"ONR"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Support Recovery With Orthogonal Matching Pursuit in the Presence of Noise","sourcePdf":"tsp-wang-2468676-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.094985S","chronDate":"Nov.1,  2015","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"7273734","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"44","xplore-issue":"7273734","articleId":"7202899","onlineDate":"14 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7202904,"authors":[{"name":"Julio Cesar Stacchini de Souza","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and the Institute of Computing, Fluminense Federal University, Niter\u00f3i, Brazil"],"bio":{"p":["Julio Cesar Stacchini de Souza (S\u201992\u2013M\u201996\u2013SM\u201903) received the D.Sc. degree in electrical engineering from the Catholic University of Rio de Janeiro, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, in 1996.","From 1988 to 1989, he was with General Electric Company, Fairfield, CT, USA.

While basic theoretical system performance is well understood, practical aspects such as those arising from estimating the time-varying channels due to parameter drifts or inherent channel dynamics are not so well explored. The integration of adaptive estimators for these time-varying channels into the iterative receiver is studied, and it is shown that simple correlation-based estimators are sufficient to allow adequate tracking even for time-varying channels in a multiple access environment, and that near-ideal performance of the receiver is achievable. The requirements of the estimators and their performance in the demodulation loops are investigated via system convergence functions.

The DgRL drives the isolated ground of the instrumentation towards a voltage which is fixed with respect to the common mode potential on the subject, therefore minimizing common mode voltage at the input of the front-end. The paper provides an analytical derivation of the common mode rejection performances of DgRL as compared to the usual grounding circuit or Driven Right Leg (DRL) loop. DgRL is integrated in a bio-potential acquisition system to show how it can reduce the common mode signal of more than 70 dB with respect to standard patient grounding. This value is at least 30 dB higher than the reduction achievable with DRL, making DgRL suitable for single-ended front-ends, like those based on active electrodes. EEG signal acquisition is performed to show how the system can successfully cancel power line interference without any need for differential acquisition, signal post-processing or filtering.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7202914/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 August 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2016","volume":"10","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"01 March 2016","accessionNumber":"15823096","pubMedId":"26285217","publicationDate":"April 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7202914/","isStaticHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A Driving Right Leg Circuit (DgRL) for Improved Common Mode Rejection in Bio-Potential Acquisition Systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Driving Right Leg Circuit (DgRL) for Improved Common Mode Rejection in Bio-Potential Acquisition Systems","sourcePdf":"tbcas-guermandi-2446753-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.053567S","chronDate":"April  2016","xplore-pub-id":"4156126","isNumber":"7422857","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4156126","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"7422857","articleId":"7202914","onlineDate":"14 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-16"},{"_id":7202920,"authors":[{"name":"Yulia Yu.

Change classification predicts defects at the change level, where a change is the modifications to one file in a commit. In this paper, we conduct the first study of applying change classification in practice. We identify two issues in the prediction process, both of which contribute to the low prediction performance. First, the data are imbalanced -- there are much fewer buggy changes than clean changes. Second, the commonly used cross-validation approach is inappropriate for evaluating the performance of change classification. To address these challenges, we apply and adapt online change classification, resampling, and updatable classification techniques to improve the classification performance. We perform the improved change classification techniques on one proprietary and six open source projects. Our results show that these techniques improve the precision of change classification by 12.2-89.5% or 6.4 -- 34.8 percentage points (pp.) on the seven projects. In addition, we integrate change classification in the development process of the proprietary project. We have learned the following lessons: 1) new solutions are needed to convince developers to use and believe prediction results, and prediction results need to be actionable, 2) new and improved classification algorithms are needed to explain the prediction results, and insensible and unactionable explanations need to be filtered or refined, and 3) new techniques are needed to improve the relatively low precision.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7202933","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSE.2015.139","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE/ACM 37th IEEE International Conference on Software Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE/ACM 37th IEEE International Conference on Software Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel7/7174815/7202933/07202954.pdf","startPage":"99","endPage":"108","doi":"10.1109/ICSE.2015.139","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Online Defect Prediction for Imbalanced Data","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-24 May 2015","displayDocTitle":"Online Defect Prediction for Imbalanced Data","isConference":true,"volume":"2","conferenceDate":"16-24 May 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7202954/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2015","accessionNumber":"15382240","dateOfInsertion":"17 August 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7202954/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Online Defect Prediction for Imbalanced Data","confLoc":"Florence, Italy","sourcePdf":"1934b099.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.083303S","chronDate":"16-24 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7174815","isNumber":"7202933","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7174815","citationCount":"100","xplore-issue":"7202933","articleId":"7202954","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7203034,"authors":[{"name":"Christoph Treude","affiliation":["Departamento de Informatica e Matem\u00e1tica Aplicada, Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Norte, Natal, RN, Brazil"],"firstName":"Christoph","lastName":"Treude","id":"37315775500"},{"name":"Mathieu Sicard","affiliation":["School of Computer Science, McGill University, Montr\u00e9al, QC, Canada"],"firstName":"Mathieu","lastName":"Sicard","id":"37085387123"},{"name":"Marc Klocke","affiliation":["School of Computer Science, McGill University, Montr\u00e9al, QC, Canada"],"firstName":"Marc","lastName":"Klocke","id":"37085380709"},{"name":"Martin Robillard","affiliation":["School of Computer Science, McGill University, Montr\u00e9al, QC, Canada"],"firstName":"Martin","lastName":"Robillard","id":"37283853000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-1934-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0270-5257"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-1225"}],"articleNumber":"7203034","dbTime":"18 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":10,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":262},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7203034","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Documentation","Instruction sets","Software engineering","Interference","Navigation","Electronic mail"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["document handling","information retrieval","software engineering"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["task-based navigation","software documentation","TaskNav","task descriptions","programming actions","code elements","section headers","auto-complete search interface","extracted task descriptions","documentation structure","software developers"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Software Documentation","Development Tasks","Navigation","Auto-Complete","Natural Language Processing"]}],"abstract":"To help developers navigate documentation, we introduce Task Nav, a tool that automatically discovers and indexes task descriptions in software documentation.

In particular, the error probability is fixed, and the tradeoff between the block length and back-off from capacity is analyzed. A lower bound is provided on the error probability under MAP decoding with list size L for any binary-input memoryless output-symmetric channel and for any class of linear codes such that their minimum distance is unbounded as the block length grows large. Then, it is shown that under MAP decoding, although the introduction of a list can significantly improve the involved constants, the scaling exponent itself, i.e., the speed at which capacity is approached, stays unaffected for any finite list size. In particular, this result applies to polar codes, since their minimum distance tends to infinity as the block length increases. A similar result is proved for genie-aided successive cancellation decoding when transmission takes place over the binary erasure channel, namely, the scaling exponent remains constant for any fixed number of helps from the genie. Note that since genie-aided successive cancellation decoding might be strictly worse than successive cancellation list decoding, the problem of establishing the scaling exponent of the latter remains open.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Decoding","Error probability","Capacity planning","Linear codes","Correlation","Linear systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel coding","error statistics","linear codes","maximum likelihood decoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["scaling exponent","list decoders","polar codes","performance gains","genie-aided successive cancellation list decoding","error probability","block length","back-off-from-capacity","MAP decoding","finite list size","binary-input memoryless output-symmetric channel","linear codes","minimum distance","binary erasure channel"]},{"kwd":["Genie-aided decoding","list decoding","MAP decoding","polar codes","scaling exponent"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7203252","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2015.2453315","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel7/18/7203188/07203252.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2015.2453315","startPage":"4838","endPage":"4851","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7203188","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Scaling Exponent of List Decoders With Applications to Polar Codes","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Scaling Exponent of List Decoders With Applications to Polar Codes","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7203252/","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 August 2015","volume":"61","issue":"9","htmlLink":"/document/7203252/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"14 August 2015","publicationDate":"Sept. 2015","accessionNumber":"15379484","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001711","fundingName":"Swiss National Science Foundation for the Promotion of Scientific Research","grantNumber":"200020_146832/1"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Scaling Exponent of List Decoders With Applications to Polar Codes","sourcePdf":"tit-mondelli-2453315-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.103853S","chronDate":"Sept.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"7203188","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"7203188","articleId":"7203252","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7203269,"authors":[{"name":"Kristian M.

Multiple improvements are provided with respect to a similar method already been used for induction machines. The method is based on the temporary injection of a DC voltage in the machine phases during normal operation. The stator resistance estimation is obtained by means of the Ohm's law. The proposed scheme works entirely in the stator fixed reference frame, without the need of any machine parameter. The selection of the DC injection level is discussed, as well as the countermeasures for reducing the spurious harmonics appearing in the currents and the torque when the machine is speed- and current-regulated. In particular, minimum electric loss and minimum torque ripple due to the injection is achieved. Moreover, as an alternative to conventional low-pass filtering of the measured signals, it is shown that the resistance estimation can be obtained by averaging the signals over few electric periods.

This technique typically makes use of a sinusoidal voltage source swept from 0.1 mHz to 1 kHz. The excitation test voltage source used must meet certain characteristics, such as high output voltage, high fidelity, low noise and low harmonic content. The amplifier used; in the test voltage source; must be able to drive highly capacitive loads. This paper proposes that a switch-mode assisted linear amplifier (SMALA) can be used in the test voltage source to meet these criteria. A three level SMALA prototype amplifier was built to experimentally demonstrate the effectiveness of this proposal. The developed SMALA prototype shows no discernable harmonic distortion in the output voltage waveform, or the need for output filters, and is therefore seen as a preferable option to pulse width modulated digital amplifiers. The lack of harmonic distortion and high frequency switching noise in the output voltage of this SMALA prototype demonstrates its feasibility for applications in FDS, particularly on highly capacitive test objects such as transformer insulation systems.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Switches","Power transformer insulation","Capacitors","Voltage control","Oil insulation","Current measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power amplifiers","power transformers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["switch mode assisted linear amplifier","high fidelity voltage source","frequency domain spectroscopy","FDS","three level SMALA prototype amplifier","harmonic distortion","pulse width modulated digital amplifiers","high frequency switching noise","transformer insulation systems"]}],"doi":"10.1109/PEDS.2015.7203395","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 11th International Conference on Power Electronics and Drive Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 11th International Conference on Power Electronics and Drive Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/7167742/7203373/07203395.pdf","startPage":"188","endPage":"193","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7203373","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PEDS.2015.7203395","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Development of a switch mode assisted linear amplifier for use as a high fidelity voltage source","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7203395","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Development of a switch mode assisted linear amplifier for use as a high fidelity voltage source","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7203395/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7203395/","accessionNumber":"15367065","conferenceDate":"9-12 June 2015","dateOfInsertion":"17 August 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-12 June 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Development of a switch mode assisted linear amplifier for use as a high fidelity voltage source","confLoc":"Sydney, NSW, Australia","sourcePdf":"153.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061894S","chronDate":"9-12 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7167742","isNumber":"7203373","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7167742","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"7203373","articleId":"7203395","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7203410,"authors":[{"name":"Hsung-Hao Hsu","affiliation":["Institute of Electrical and Control Engineering National Chiao Tung Univ., Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Hsung-Hao","lastName":"Hsu","id":"37085721736"},{"name":"Ying-Yu Tzou","affiliation":["Institute of Electrical and Control Engineering National Chiao Tung Univ., Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Ying-Yu","lastName":"Tzou","id":"37275213400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-4402-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2164-5264"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2164-5256"}],"articleNumber":"7203410","dbTime":"34 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":694},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Pulse width modulation","Inverters","Synchronous motors","Stator windings","Switching frequency","Permanent magnet motors","Inductors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["digital control","field programmable gate arrays","machine control","optimisation","permanent magnet motors","PWM invertors","PWM power convertors","stators","synchronous motors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["digital PWM control technique","segmented permanent magnet synchronous motor","multiphase interleaved PWM inverter","segmented stator windings","segmented PWM converter","multiphase interleaved PWM technique","phase shedding control strategy","efficiency optimization","light load condition","digital PWM modulator","adjustable switching frequency","phase shift","loss analysis","FPGA control","segmented PMSM"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["FPGA","Multiphase inverter","segmented motor","configurable stator windings","multi-phase interleaved PWM control"]}],"abstract":"This paper proposes a digital PWM control technique for a segmented permanent magnet synchronous motor with multi-phase interleaved PWM inverters.

Single-pulse operation is often employed to control the SRM above base speed, as it yields a beneficial high efficiency. A serious drawback of SRMs is their unpleasant acoustic behavior, which is hard to control in single-pulse operation. Thus, optimization of SRMs' acoustics is an important subject. This work proposes and examines dithered switching angles in order to improve the acoustic behavior of SRMs in single-pulse operation. Different strategies to randomly change the switching angles are evaluated in simulation. The influence on the acoustic behavior is characterized by means of surface normal velocity and the psychoacoustic indicators loudness and sharpness. The results are verified in measurements for a 20kW Switched Reluctance Generator (SRG) using an FPGA-based controller. The results of the proposed strategy yield slightly better acoustic behavior. The sharpness of the SRG's noise is reduced whereas the mean-square surface normal velocity is nearly kept constant. This is due to the intended cover up effect of the dominant peaks in the frequency spectrum when dithered switching angles are employed.","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 11th International Conference on Power Electronics and Drive Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/7167742/7203373/07203471.pdf","startPage":"754","endPage":"761","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 11th International Conference on Power Electronics and Drive Systems","doi":"10.1109/PEDS.2015.7203471","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PEDS.2015.7203471","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7203373","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7203471","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Influence of an FPGA-based switching angle dithering on acoustics in single-pulse controlled switched reluctance machines","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Switches","Acoustics","Reluctance machines","Acoustic measurements","Torque","Simulation","Noise"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["acoustics","field programmable gate arrays","reluctance generators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FPGA-based switching angle dithering","single-pulse controlled switched reluctance machines","SRM","production costs","acoustic behavior","psychoacoustic indicators loudness","psychoacoustic indicators sharpness","switched reluctance generator","SRG","mean-square surface normal velocity","frequency spectrum","power 20 kW"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7203471/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-12 June 2015","displayDocTitle":"Influence of an FPGA-based switching angle dithering on acoustics in single-pulse controlled switched reluctance machines","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7203471/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15367082","dateOfInsertion":"17 August 2015","conferenceDate":"9-12 June 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Influence of an FPGA-based switching angle dithering on acoustics in single-pulse controlled switched reluctance machines","confLoc":"Sydney, NSW, Australia","sourcePdf":"313.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.079356S","chronDate":"9-12 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7167742","isNumber":"7203373","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7167742","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"7203373","articleId":"7203471","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7203537,"authors":[{"name":"Yueh-Ru Yang","affiliation":["Ming Chi University of Technology, New Taipei City, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Yueh-Ru","lastName":"Yang","id":"37336826600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-4402-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2164-5264"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2164-5256"}],"articleNumber":"7203537","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":221},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Resonant inverters","Transistors","Capacitors","Switching circuits","Inductors","Resonant frequency","Resistance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bipolar transistors","capacitors","fluorescent lamps","inductors","MOSFET","power transformers","resonant invertors","switching convertors","zero voltage switching"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["half-bridge resonant inverter","push-pull resonant inverter","cold cathode fluorescent lamp","inductor","center tapped transformer","parallel resonant capacitor","bipolar junction transistors","series resonant capacitor","metal-oxide-semiconductor field effect transistors","current-output characteristics","zero voltage switching","CCFL"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["CCFL","Inverter","Push-pull","Half-bridge"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7203537","doi":"10.1109/PEDS.2015.7203537","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PEDS.2015.7203537","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7203373","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 11th International Conference on Power Electronics and Drive Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 11th International Conference on Power Electronics and Drive Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/7167742/7203373/07203537.pdf","startPage":"696","endPage":"702","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Comparison of push-pull and half-bridge resonant inverters for cold cathode fluorescent lamps","abstract":"This paper compares a push-pull resonant inverter with a half-bridge resonant inverter for cold cathode fluorescent lamps.

In the proposed method, a two-level hysteresis comparator is used to restrict the error voltage, i.e. difference of upper and lower capacitors voltage, within the hysteresis band. The comparator will produce suitable digitized output status to be indexed into a look-up table for selecting appropriate switching states to compensate the mismatch voltages. In doing so, the variation of two capacitors voltages can be controlled, consistently, as compared to that of using the common SVM approaches where the variation (or error of ripple) is not strictly maintained. Some experimental results are presented to highlight the improvements of DTC performances as well as the robustness of control balancing strategy for steady state and dynamic conditions.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7203373","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PEDS.2015.7203551","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 11th International Conference on Power Electronics and Drive Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 11th International Conference on Power Electronics and Drive Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/7167742/7203373/07203551.pdf","startPage":"1002","endPage":"1006","doi":"10.1109/PEDS.2015.7203551","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A simple potential balancing strategy for neutral-point-clamped inverter fed direct torque control induction machines","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-12 June 2015","displayDocTitle":"A simple potential balancing strategy for neutral-point-clamped inverter fed direct torque control induction machines","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"9-12 June 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7203551/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15483809","dateOfInsertion":"17 August 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7203551/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A simple potential balancing strategy for neutral-point-clamped inverter fed direct torque control induction machines","confLoc":"Sydney, NSW, Australia","sourcePdf":"443.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069557S","chronDate":"9-12 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7167742","isNumber":"7203373","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7167742","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"7203373","articleId":"7203551","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-17"},{"_id":7203557,"authors":[{"name":"Meenu D Nair","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, NIT Calicut, India"],"firstName":"Meenu D","lastName":"Nair","id":"37085448982"},{"name":"G Vivek","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, NIT Calicut, India"],"firstName":"G","lastName":"Vivek","id":"37085430033"},{"name":"Mukti Barai","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, NIT Calicut, India"],"firstName":"Mukti","lastName":"Barai","id":"37279933700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-4402-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2164-5264"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2164-5256"}],"articleNumber":"7203557","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":221},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7203557","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Clamps","Switches","Space vector pulse width modulation","Inverters","Distortion"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["harmonic distortion","induction motor drives","insulated gate bipolar transistors","PWM invertors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["clamping position variation","advanced bus clamping strategies","discontinuous space vector pulse width modulation","clamping position","zero vector changing angle","continuous switching sequence","bus clamping PWM","BCPWM","clamping method","inverter switching losses","line current distortion","SVPWM switching strategies","3-phase induction motor drive","IGBT","voltage source inverter","VSI","PIC microcontroller","line current harmonics","power factor angles","total harmonic distortion"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Voltage source inverter (VSI)","pulse width modulation(PWM)","space vector","double switching sequence","continual clamp PWM","split clamp PWM"]}],"abstract":"This paper evaluates the performance of conventional and advanced discontinuous space vector pulse width modulation(PWM)with the variation in placement of clamping position (zero vector changing angle). Conventional space vector pulse width modulation (CSVPWM) employs continuous switching sequence, which equally divides the two zero vector in every sub cycle. Bus clamping PWM (BCPWM) techniques uses discontinuous sequence in a sub cycle. Clamping method reduces the inverter switching losses and the line current distortion. This work brings out the performance of BCPWM techniques which employs the different location of the phase clamping. The line current distortion is considered as the main performance index for analysis. The different SVPWM switching strategies are implemented on a 415V, 2hp, 50Hz, 3-phase induction motor drive which is fed from an IGBT based 2 KVA voltage source inverter(VSI) with a DC bus voltage of 400 V A low cost PIC microcontroller (PIC18F452)is used as the controller platform. The experimental results shown that the clamping position of a phase has significant role in the reduction in line current harmonics at various power factor angles. The comparative results for clamping strategies for variation in zero vector changing angle reveals that the advanced split clamped SVPWM strategy has less total harmonic distortion compared to the other strategies.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7203373","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PEDS.2015.7203557","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 11th International Conference on Power Electronics and Drive Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 11th International Conference on Power Electronics and Drive Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/7167742/7203373/07203557.pdf","startPage":"1156","endPage":"1161","doi":"10.1109/PEDS.2015.7203557","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance evaluation of clamping position variation on advanced bus clamping strategies: Experimental investigation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-12 June 2015","displayDocTitle":"Performance evaluation of clamping position variation on advanced bus clamping strategies: Experimental investigation","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"9-12 June 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7203557/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15367035","dateOfInsertion":"17 August 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7203557/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance evaluation of clamping position variation on advanced bus clamping strategies: Experimental investigation","confLoc":"Sydney, NSW, Australia","sourcePdf":"451.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044939S","chronDate":"9-12 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7167742","isNumber":"7203373","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7167742","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"7203373","articleId":"7203557","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7203560,"authors":[{"name":"Piotr Derugo","affiliation":["Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Wroclaw University of Technology, Wroc\u0142aw, Poland"],"firstName":"Piotr","lastName":"Derugo","id":"37085340994"},{"name":"Krzysztof Szabat","affiliation":["Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Wroclaw University of Technology, Wroc\u0142aw, Poland"],"firstName":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Szabat","id":"37281992600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-4402-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2164-5264"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2164-5256"}],"articleNumber":"7203560","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":189},"abstract":"In the paper an adaptive fuzzy logic control based structure for damping of torsional vibrations is proposed.

The results show that the proposed MPAM-PBB method can achieve comparable performance with PAB method and get higher SE of the system than PBB method without increasing the computational complexity.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Mixed-polar-amplitude-modulation pilot-based blind phase estimation for coherent optical OFDM system","publicationTitle":"2015 14th International Conference on Optical Communications and Networks (ICOCN)","doi":"10.1109/ICOCN.2015.7203702","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 14th International Conference on Optical Communications and Networks (ICOCN)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7180493/7203587/07203702.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"3","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICOCN.2015.7203702","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7203587","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7203702","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7203702/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 July 2015","displayDocTitle":"Mixed-polar-amplitude-modulation pilot-based blind phase estimation for coherent optical OFDM system","conferenceDate":"3-5 July 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7203702/","dateOfInsertion":"17 August 2015","publicationDate":"July 2015","accessionNumber":"15382399","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Mixed-polar-amplitude-modulation pilot-based blind phase estimation for coherent optical OFDM system","confLoc":"Nanjing, China","sourcePdf":"MIXEDPOLARAMPLITUDEMODU.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046268S","chronDate":"3-5 July 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7180493","isNumber":"7203587","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7180493","xplore-issue":"7203587","articleId":"7203702","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7203712,"authors":[{"name":"Peng Wu","affiliation":["Northwestern Polytechnical Universty, Xi'an, China"],"lastName":"Peng Wu","id":"37085501082"},{"name":"Jie Lian","affiliation":["University of Virginia, Charlottesville, USA"],"lastName":"Jie Lian","id":"37085468397"},{"name":"Baowang Lian","affiliation":["Northwestern Polytechnical Universty, Xi'an, China"],"lastName":"Baowang Lian","id":"37861952800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7373-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7372-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7203712","dbTime":"15 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":285},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Light emitting diodes","Optical transmitters","Adaptive optics","Clocks","Optical receivers","Integrated optics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiple access","light emitting diodes","optical fibre networks","time-of-arrival estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optical CDMA","wireless indoor positioning","time-of-arrival","light emitting diodes","optical code division multiple assess","light-emitting diodes","LED","ceiling light fixtures","photo sensor","fixed point","code phase information"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Indoor optical positioning","optical code-division multiple-access (OCDMA)","time of arriving (TOA)"]}],"abstract":"We propose a novel visible light wireless indoor positioning scheme based on optical-code-division multiple-assess (OCDMA) and time-of-arrival (TOA) principle. A set of three light-emitting diodes (LEDs) ceiling light fixtures are utilized to transmit their location information to a device, equipped with a photo-sensor, seeking to determine its own position. The three LEDs, sharing a common clock, transmit their coordinate information to the photo-sensor using a unique OCDMA spreading code previously assigned to them. A fixed point is adopted to compensate the time bias errors which derived from time delay and non-synchronized clock in TOA system. After receiving the three superimposed information bit streams, the receiver collects the TOA by measuring code phase information from each light and retrieves the coordinate information of each LED. Based on these processes as mentioned above, we show that the receiver will be able to accurately compute its own position. Simulations demonstrate that a positioning accuracy of less than 6.5 cmis achieved.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optical CDMA-based wireless indoor positioning through time-of-arrival of light-emitting diodes","publicationTitle":"2015 14th International Conference on Optical Communications and Networks (ICOCN)","doi":"10.1109/ICOCN.2015.7203712","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 14th International Conference on Optical Communications and Networks (ICOCN)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7180493/7203587/07203712.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"3","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICOCN.2015.7203712","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7203587","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7203712","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7203712/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 July 2015","displayDocTitle":"Optical CDMA-based wireless indoor positioning through time-of-arrival of light-emitting diodes","conferenceDate":"3-5 July 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7203712/","dateOfInsertion":"17 August 2015","publicationDate":"July 2015","accessionNumber":"15382442","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optical CDMA-based wireless indoor positioning through time-of-arrival of light-emitting diodes","confLoc":"Nanjing, China","sourcePdf":"OPTICALCDMABASEDWIRELESSI.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06057S","chronDate":"3-5 July 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7180493","isNumber":"7203587","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7180493","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7203587","articleId":"7203712","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7203718,"authors":[{"name":"Ronghua Chi","affiliation":["Southeast University, Nanjing, China","Wuxi Zhongxing Optoelectronics Technology Co., Ltd, Wuxi, China"],"lastName":"Ronghua Chi","id":"37087268955"},{"name":"Xianqin Li","affiliation":["Wuxi Zhongxing Optoelectronics Technology Co., Ltd, Wuxi, China"],"lastName":"Xianqin Li","id":"37087269389"},{"name":"Xiaohan Sun","affiliation":["Southeast University, Nanjing, China"],"lastName":"Xiaohan Sun","id":"37087083207"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7373-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7372-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7203718","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":81},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optical fiber amplifiers","Stimulated emission","Erbium-doped fiber amplifiers","Optical fiber dispersion","Optical fiber networks","Gain"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optical communication","optical fibre amplifiers","wavelength division multiplexing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optimized amplification scheme","unrepeated DWDM system","optical transmission system","Erbium doped fiber amplifier","EDFA","remotely pumped optical amplifier","ROPA","EDFA/ROPA scheme"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Unrepeated transmission","Erbium doped fiber amplifier","Raman fiber amplifier","remotely pumped optical amplifier"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7203718","abstract":"This paper reports a 325-km ultra-long span repeater-less transmission system in a 17\u00d710 Gbit/s optical transmission system by using different amplification schemes.

Instead of dividing the multiplication into the generation of partial products and the summation using a compressor tree, as done in modern multipliers, an array-like architecture is proposed. Each row of the array generates a partial product which is directly added to results of previous rows using the fast carry chain. A radix-4 Booth encoding/decoding is used to reduce the I/O count of the partial product generation which makes it possible to map both, the Booth encoder and decoder, into a single 6-input look up table (LUT). Like a conventional Booth multiplier, this nearly halves the number of rows compared to a ripple carry array multiplier. In addition, the compressor tree is completely avoided and an efficient and regular structure retains that uses up to 50% less slice resources compared to previous approaches and offers a multiply accumulate (MAC) operation without extra resources.","doi":"10.1109/ARITH.2015.17","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ARITH.2015.17","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 22nd Symposium on Computer Arithmetic","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 22nd Symposium on Computer Arithmetic","pdfPath":"/iel7/7193754/7203778/07203791.pdf","startPage":"18","endPage":"25","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7203778","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Efficient Softcore Multiplier Architecture for Xilinx FPGAs","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7203791/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 June 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"An Efficient Softcore Multiplier Architecture for Xilinx FPGAs","conferenceDate":"22-24 June 2015","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"20 August 2015","publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15399583","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7203791/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Efficient Softcore Multiplier Architecture for Xilinx FPGAs","confLoc":"Lyon, France","sourcePdf":"8664a018.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.108097S","chronDate":"22-24 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7193754","isNumber":"7203778","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7193754","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"7203778","articleId":"7203791","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7203792,"authors":[{"name":"Martin Langhammer","affiliation":["Altera European Technology Centre, High Wycombe, UK"],"firstName":"Martin","lastName":"Langhammer","id":"37348413000"},{"name":"Bogdan Pasca","affiliation":["Altera European Technology Centre, High Wycombe, UK"],"firstName":"Bogdan","lastName":"Pasca","id":"37545456300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8664-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-8663-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6889"}],"articleNumber":"7203792","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":491},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7203792","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Adders","Digital signal processing","Field programmable gate arrays","Registers","Routing","Pipelines","Multiplexing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adders","digital signal processing chips","field programmable gate arrays","floating point arithmetic","logic design","reconfigurable architectures"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["embedded FPGA floating point DSP block","circuit design","single precision floating-point arithmetic","multiply-add-based fixed-point arithmetic cores","hardened DSP resources","embedded memory blocks","soft logic resources","ASIC","SP FP multiplier","SP FP adder-subtracter","FPGA routing density","low latency structure","power consumption penalty","size 20 nm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["FPGA","floating-point","single precision","DSP","CPA","subnormal"]}],"abstract":"This paper describes the architecture and implementation, from both the standpoint of target applications as well as circuit design, of an FPGA DSP Block that can efficiently support both fixed and single precision (SP) floating-point (FP) arithmetic. Most contemporary FPGAs embed DSP blocks that provide simple multiply-add-based fixed-point arithmetic cores. Current FP arithmetic FPGA solutions make use of these hardened DSP resources, together with embedded memory blocks and soft logic resources, however, larger systems cannot be efficiently implemented due to the routing and soft logic limitations on the devices, resulting in significant area, performance, and power consumption penalties compared to ASIC implementations. In this paper we analyse earlier proposed embedded FP implementations, and show why they are not suitable for a production FPGA. We contrast these against our solution -- a unified DSP Block -- where (a) the SP FP multiplier is overlaid on the fixed point constructs, (b) the SP FP Adder/Subtracter is integrated as a separate unit, and (c) the multiplier and adder can be combined in a way that is both arithmetically useful, but also efficient in terms of FPGA routing density and congestion. In addition, a novel way of seamlessly combining any number of DSP Blocks in a low latency structure will be introduced. We will show that this new approach allows a low cost, low power, and high density FP platform on current production 20nm FPGAs. We also describe a future enhancement of the DSP block that can support subnormal numbers.","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 22nd Symposium on Computer Arithmetic","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 22nd Symposium on Computer Arithmetic","pdfPath":"/iel7/7193754/7203778/07203792.pdf","startPage":"26","endPage":"33","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ARITH.2015.18","doi":"10.1109/ARITH.2015.18","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7203778","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design and Implementation of an Embedded FPGA Floating Point DSP Block","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Design and Implementation of an Embedded FPGA Floating Point DSP Block","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7203792/","conferenceDate":"22-24 June 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7203792/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"20 August 2015","publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15399587","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 June 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design and Implementation of an Embedded FPGA Floating Point DSP Block","confLoc":"Lyon, France","sourcePdf":"8664a026.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.105502S","chronDate":"22-24 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7193754","isNumber":"7203778","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7193754","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"7203778","articleId":"7203792","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7203793,"authors":[{"name":"Florent De Dinechin","affiliation":["Universite de Lyon, Lyon, Auvergne-Rh\u00c3\u00b4ne-Alpes, FR"],"firstName":"Florent","lastName":"De Dinechin","id":"37347508700"},{"name":"Matei Istoan","affiliation":["INRIA, Universit\u00e9 de Lyon, Villeurbanne, France"],"firstName":"Matei","lastName":"Istoan","id":"37078178900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8664-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-8663-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6889"}],"articleNumber":"7203793","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":13,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":605},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7203793","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Polynomials","Approximation methods","Accuracy","Computer architecture","Hardware","Field programmable gate arrays","Context"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","fixed point arithmetic","piecewise polynomial techniques","signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fixed-point Atan2","digital signal processing","CORDIC shift-and-add algorithm","multiplier-based techniques","polynomial approximation methods","piecewise bivariate polynomial approximations","argument reduction","open-source FloPoCo framework","FPGA"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["arctangent","atan2","hardware","FPGA arithmetic"]}],"abstract":"The atan2 function computes the polar angle arctan(y/x) of a point given by its cartesian coordinates. It is widely used in digital signal processing to recover the phase of a signal. This article studies for this context the implementation of atan2 with fixed-point inputs and outputs. It compares the prevalent CORDIC shift-and-add algorithm to two multiplier-based techniques. The first one computes the bivariate atan2 function as the composition of two univariate functions: the reciprocal, and the arctangent, each evaluated using bipartite or polynomial approximation methods. The second technique directly uses piecewise bivariate polynomial approximations of degree 1 or 2. Each of these approaches requires a relevant argument reduction, which is also discussed. All the algorithms are last-bit accurate, and implemented with similar care in the open-source FloPoCo framework. Based on synthesis results on FPGAs, their relevance domains are discussed.","doi":"10.1109/ARITH.2015.23","startPage":"34","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 22nd Symposium on Computer Arithmetic","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 22nd Symposium on Computer Arithmetic","pdfPath":"/iel7/7193754/7203778/07203793.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ARITH.2015.23","endPage":"41","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7203778","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hardware Implementations of Fixed-Point Atan2","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7203793/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 June 2015","displayDocTitle":"Hardware Implementations of Fixed-Point Atan2","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7203793/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"15399582","conferenceDate":"22-24 June 2015","dateOfInsertion":"20 August 2015","publicationDate":"June 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hardware Implementations of Fixed-Point Atan2","confLoc":"Lyon, France","sourcePdf":"8664a034.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.076834S","chronDate":"22-24 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7193754","isNumber":"7203778","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7193754","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"7203778","articleId":"7203793","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7203794,"authors":[{"name":"David B.

However, HLS users are limited to the set of numerical primitives provided by HLS vendors and designers of floating-point IP cores, and cannot easily implement new fast or accurate numerical primitives. This paper presents a method for automatically creating high-performance pipelined floating-point function approximations, which can be integrated as IP cores into numerical accelerators, whether derived from HLS or traditional design methods. Both input and output are floating-point, but internally the function approximator uses fixed-point polynomial segments, guaranteeing a faithfully rounded output. A robust and automated non-uniform segmentation scheme is used to segment any twice-differentiable input function and produce platform-independent VHDL. The approach is demonstrated across ten functions, which are automatically generated then placed and routed in Xilinx devices. The method provides a 1.1x-3x improvement in area over composite numerical approximations, while providing similar performance and significantly better relative error.","doi":"10.1109/ARITH.2015.27","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 22nd Symposium on Computer Arithmetic","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 22nd Symposium on Computer Arithmetic","pdfPath":"/iel7/7193754/7203778/07203794.pdf","startPage":"42","endPage":"49","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ARITH.2015.27","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7203778","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7203794","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A General-Purpose Method for Faithfully Rounded Floating-Point Function Approximation in FPGAs","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 June 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7203794/","displayDocTitle":"A General-Purpose Method for Faithfully Rounded Floating-Point Function Approximation in FPGAs","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7203794/","publicationDate":"June 2015","dateOfInsertion":"20 August 2015","conferenceDate":"22-24 June 2015","accessionNumber":"15399589","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A General-Purpose Method for Faithfully Rounded Floating-Point Function Approximation in FPGAs","confLoc":"Lyon, France","sourcePdf":"8664a042.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.079475S","chronDate":"22-24 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7193754","isNumber":"7203778","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7193754","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"7203778","articleId":"7203794","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7203890,"authors":[{"name":"Tiago M.

Adequate selection of the UWB signal applied to the directly modulated laser (DML) and fixed in-line optical dispersion compensation are shown as effective solutions to reach 130 km of standard single-mode fibre. In addition, error vector magnitude (EVM) levels compliant with the UWB standard are achieved for LR-PONs with reaches between 75 km and 130 km. It is also shown that, for optical channel spacing as narrow as 0.2 nm, the proposed system suffers from negligible linear inter-channel crosstalk as the EVM of the UWB bands transmitted in the central channel of a wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) signal consisting in three optical channels, is similar to the EVM of the UWB bands transmitted in that channel when single-channel operation is considered.

However, the algorithms used for reconstruction, generally based on L1 norm minimization, are very complex and time consuming. The major effect of random sampling is the appearance of missing pixels. Because inpainting algorithms are able to fill the missing data, we propose to use them as CS reconstruction algorithms. For the case of CS images obtained by random sampling, we propose the inpaint_nans algorithm for reconstruction. We justify our proposal by simulation results and comparisons with L1 norm based CS reconstruction algorithms.","doi":"10.1109/ISSCS.2015.7203954","publicationTitle":"2015 International Symposium on Signals, Circuits and Systems (ISSCS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 International Symposium on Signals, Circuits and Systems (ISSCS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7180553/7203913/07203954.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISSCS.2015.7203954","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7203913","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Images compressive sensing reconstruction by inpainting","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7203954","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Images compressive sensing reconstruction by inpainting","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-10 July 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7203954/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"9-10 July 2015","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2015","accessionNumber":"15382518","dateOfInsertion":"17 August 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7203954/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Images compressive sensing reconstruction by inpainting","confLoc":"Iasi, Romania","sourcePdf":"041.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.102091S","chronDate":"9-10 July 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7180553","isNumber":"7203913","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7180553","xplore-issue":"7203913","articleId":"7203954","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7203955,"authors":[{"name":"Ervin Szopos","affiliation":["Technical University of Cluj-Napoca, Cluj-Napoca, Romania"],"firstName":"Ervin","lastName":"Szopos","id":"37563247300"},{"name":"Ioana Saracut","affiliation":["Technical University of Cluj-Napoca, Cluj-Napoca, Romania"],"firstName":"Ioana","lastName":"Saracut","id":"37085545201"},{"name":"Calin Farcas","affiliation":["Technical University of Cluj-Napoca, Cluj-Napoca, Romania"],"firstName":"Calin","lastName":"Farcas","id":"37085529590"},{"name":"Marius Neag","affiliation":["Technical University of Cluj-Napoca, Cluj-Napoca, Romania"],"firstName":"Marius","lastName":"Neag","id":"37354213200"},{"name":"Marina Topa","affiliation":["Technical University of Cluj-Napoca, Cluj-Napoca, Romania"],"firstName":"Marina","lastName":"Topa","id":"37396170200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7488-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-7487-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7203955","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":75},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["IIR filters","Finite impulse response filters","Genetic algorithms","Filtering algorithms","Auditory system","Matched filters","Sociology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["encoding","error analysis","genetic algorithms","hearing aids","IIR filters","medical signal processing","minimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["IIR filter synthesis optimization","real-coded genetic algorithm","human audiogram emulation","user-defined magnitude response","hearing aid filter design","magnitude characteristic difference metric minimization","synthesized magnitude characteristics","wanted magnitude characteristics","peak magnitude error","total squared error","design example","FIR filter","infinite impulse response filter"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7203955","abstract":"This paper presents a method for optimized synthesis of IIR filters with user-defined magnitude response, based on a real-coded genetic algorithm.

Researchers have to consider these two effects in their studies of wireless communications. Some researchers use step channel model which is too idealized to simulate MIMO systems. Besides, sum-of-sinusoid based simulators are widely used among which Jakes' simulator is the most well-known. However this kind of simulator has to strive for the deficiencies in higher-order statistics due to the approximation of random variables by determinants. In this paper, we propose a time selective channel model used for laboratory simulations from a new sight which can avoid the above drawbacks. The channel is reconstructed by sinc function based on Nyquist's sampling theorem. The performance of DSTM scheme is evaluated in this new channel model.","doi":"10.1109/ISSCS.2015.7203999","publicationTitle":"2015 International Symposium on Signals, Circuits and Systems (ISSCS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 International Symposium on Signals, Circuits and Systems (ISSCS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7180553/7203913/07203999.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISSCS.2015.7203999","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7203913","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance of DSTM MIMO systems in continuously changing Rayleigh channel","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7203999","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-10 July 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7203999/","displayDocTitle":"Performance of DSTM MIMO systems in continuously changing Rayleigh channel","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2015","accessionNumber":"15382551","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7203999/","conferenceDate":"9-10 July 2015","dateOfInsertion":"17 August 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance of DSTM MIMO systems in continuously changing Rayleigh channel","confLoc":"Iasi, Romania","sourcePdf":"091.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.089686S","chronDate":"9-10 July 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7180553","isNumber":"7203913","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7180553","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7203913","articleId":"7203999","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7204002,"authors":[{"name":"Ana-Maria Pi\u015ftea","affiliation":["Dep. of Communications and Military Electronic Systems, Military Technical Academy, Bucharest, Romania"],"firstName":"Ana-Maria","lastName":"Pi\u015ftea","id":"37546444200"},{"name":"Ioan Nicolaescu","affiliation":["Dep. of Communications and Military Electronic Systems, Military Technical Academy, Bucharest, Romania"],"firstName":"Ioan","lastName":"Nicolaescu","id":"37540348500"},{"name":"Emanuel R\u0103doi","affiliation":["CNRS, UMR, Lab-STICC, Brest, France"],"firstName":"Emanuel","lastName":"R\u0103doi","id":"38269840300"},{"name":"Leontin Tu\u0163\u0103","affiliation":["Dep. of Communications and Military Electronic Systems, Military Technical Academy, Bucharest, Romania"],"firstName":"Leontin","lastName":"Tu\u0163\u0103","id":"37085344402"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7488-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-7487-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7204002","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":90},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power capacitors","Estimation","Technological innovation","Frequency-domain analysis","Image reconstruction","Streaming media","Ultra wideband radar"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Gaussian processes","radar signal processing","ultra wideband communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["parametric estimation","sub-Nyquist sampling","finite rate of innovation","FRI","Gaussian UWB pulse","frequency domain","bandpass spectrum","UWB radar signals","signal estimation","UWB receivers"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7204002","abstract":"The new theory addressed to signals with finite rate of innovation (FRI) is based on the concept of minimal sampling rate of a stream of pulses. This paper describes the feasibility of two minimal sampling rate techniques not only in the case of Gaussian UWB pulse but also for its derivatives. Since the derivatives of Gaussian pulses are represented in the frequency domain by a bandpass spectrum and not by a lowpass spectrum as it happens in the case of pure Gaussian, the implementation of FRI concepts requires a specific approach. Relying on minimal sampling rate the UWB radar signals can be estimated in terms of time-delays and amplitudes of the echoes which indicate the position and strength of various scatterers. This method of signal estimation allows faster acquisition compared to the current signal estimation techniques and potentially reduces power consumption and complexity of UWB receivers. It is particularly suitable in applications such as ranging or positioning.","doi":"10.1109/ISSCS.2015.7204002","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISSCS.2015.7204002","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 International Symposium on Signals, Circuits and Systems (ISSCS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7180553/7203913/07204002.pdf","publicationTitle":"2015 International Symposium on Signals, Circuits and Systems (ISSCS)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7203913","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Parametric estimation of UWB signals with sub-Nyquist sampling","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"9-10 July 2015","displayDocTitle":"Parametric estimation of UWB signals with sub-Nyquist sampling","conferenceDate":"9-10 July 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2015","dateOfInsertion":"17 August 2015","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7204002/","accessionNumber":"15382527","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7204002/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Parametric estimation of UWB signals with sub-Nyquist sampling","confLoc":"Iasi, Romania","sourcePdf":"094.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043122S","chronDate":"9-10 July 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7180553","isNumber":"7203913","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7180553","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7203913","articleId":"7204002","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7204007,"authors":[{"name":"C.

In cable networks, analog transmission will continue to work for their users. Studies evaluating the mutual interference between terrestrial (DVB-T and analog TV) and cable standards are rare, probably because it is considered that the two transmission media (the air and cable) are sufficiently distinct to avoid influencing each other. This research is a result of a series of evaluations realized with an experimental transmitter in our area, before the professional implementation of DVB-T. Without being a comprehensive study, our research presents the mathematical background, proposes a scenario to evaluate directly and by simulation these perturbations of mutual influence in mobile DVB-T reception and cable transmissions and establish practical values to limit maximum allowed power of cable TV trunk amplifiers, in a scenario of a residential area.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7203913","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISSCS.2015.7204025","publicationTitle":"2015 International Symposium on Signals, Circuits and Systems (ISSCS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 International Symposium on Signals, Circuits and Systems (ISSCS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7180553/7203913/07204025.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","doi":"10.1109/ISSCS.2015.7204025","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the acceptable perturbation level of CATV distribution amplifiers for mobile DVB-T reception","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-10 July 2015","displayDocTitle":"On the acceptable perturbation level of CATV distribution amplifiers for mobile DVB-T reception","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"9-10 July 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7204025/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2015","accessionNumber":"15382511","dateOfInsertion":"17 August 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7204025/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the acceptable perturbation level of CATV distribution amplifiers for mobile DVB-T reception","confLoc":"Iasi, Romania","sourcePdf":"123.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.039539S","chronDate":"9-10 July 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7180553","isNumber":"7203913","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7180553","xplore-issue":"7203913","articleId":"7204025","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7204031,"authors":[{"name":"Liviu Goras","affiliation":["Institute of Computer Science, Romanian Academy, Ia\u00a7i Branch, Romania","Faculty of Electronics, \u201cGheorghe Asachi\u201d Technical University of Iasi"],"firstName":"Liviu","lastName":"Goras","id":"37298283200"},{"name":"Nicolae Patache","affiliation":["Faculty of Electronics, Telecommunications and Information Technology, \u201cGheorghe Asachi\u201d Technical University of Iasi, Romania"],"firstName":"Nicolae","lastName":"Patache"},{"name":"Paul Ungureanu","affiliation":["Faculty of Electronics, \u201cGheorghe Asachi\u201d Technical University of Iasi"],"firstName":"Paul","lastName":"Ungureanu","id":"37298292100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7488-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-7487-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7204031","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":32},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Results on the spatio-temporal dynamics of a first order cell CNN","abstract":"Cellular Neural Networks (CNN's) type analog parallel architectures have been and are studied both for their potential in high-speed signal processing applications and for their interesting spatio-temporal dynamics.

The dynamics of the class of CNN's discussed in this paper has been so far studied mainly for symmetric templates.

We prove the energy beamforming is optimal for the energy transmitter irrespective of the operating SNR. We maximize the weighted sum of rate and energy to characterize the region of rate-energy pairs that are achievable using Gaussian signaling. We propose a numerical algorithm based on the alternating optimization technique because the maximization problem is a non-convex problem. The proposed algorithm converges to a KKT point of the maximization problem. Numerical results show that the rate-energy region of the algorithm is larger than those of the existing suboptimal algorithms. In addition, the algorithm harvests 60% more energy in the high-information transfer region than the suboptimal algorithms.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/4234/7294672/07206513.pdf","startPage":"1758","endPage":"1761","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","doi":"10.1109/LCOMM.2015.2469275","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LCOMM.2015.2469275","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7294672","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7206513","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Rate-Energy Region of Joint Information and Energy Transfer in a Two-User MIMO Interference Channel","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Receivers","MIMO","Energy exchange","Interference channels","Array signal processing","Transmitters","Optimization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["concave programming","inductive power transmission","interference (signal)","MIMO communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["rate-energy region","joint information and energy transfer","two-user MIMO interference channel","energy beamforming","rate-energy pairs","Gaussian signaling","maximization problem","non-convex problem"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Joint information and energy transfer","rateenergy region","alternating optimization"]},{"kwd":["Joint information and energy transfer","rate-energy region","alternating optimization"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7206513/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 August 2015","displayDocTitle":"Rate-Energy Region of Joint Information and Energy Transfer in a Two-User MIMO Interference Channel","volume":"19","issue":"10","htmlLink":"/document/7206513/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2015","accessionNumber":"15520386","dateOfInsertion":"08 October 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Basic Science Research Program"},{"fundingName":"National Research Foundation of Korea(NRF)"},{"fundingName":"Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning","grantNumber":"NRF-2013R1A1A1012448"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Rate-Energy Region of Joint Information and Energy Transfer in a Two-User MIMO Interference Channel","sourcePdf":"lcomm-park-2469275-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.046948S","chronDate":"Oct.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"4234","isNumber":"7294672","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4234","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"7294672","articleId":"7206513","onlineDate":"17 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7206517,"authors":[{"name":"T\u00fclay Adali","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Electrical Engineering, University of Maryland Baltimore County, Baltimore, MD, USA"],"firstName":"T\u00fclay","lastName":"Adali","id":"37284803700"},{"name":"Yuri Levin-Schwartz","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Electrical Engineering, University of Maryland Baltimore County, Baltimore, MD, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5/7214335/7206517/levin-2461624-small.gif","p":["\nYuri Levin-Schwartz received the B.S. degree in physics and the B.A. degree in mathematics from Brandeis University, Waltham, MA, USA, in 2012.

Since, usually, very little is known about the actual interaction among the data sets, it is highly desirable to minimize the underlying assumptions. This has been the main reason for the growing importance of data-driven methods, and in particular of independent component analysis (ICA) as it provides useful decompositions with a simple generative model and using only the assumption of statistical independence. A recent extension of ICA, independent vector analysis (IVA), generalizes ICA to multiple data sets by exploiting the statistical dependence across the data sets, and hence, as we discuss in this paper, provides an attractive solution to fusion of data from multiple data sets along with ICA. In this paper, we focus on two multivariate solutions for multimodal data fusion that let multiple modalities fully interact for the estimation of underlying features that jointly report on all modalities. One solution is the joint ICA model that has found wide application in medical imaging, and the second one is the transposed IVA model introduced here as a generalization of an approach based on multiset canonical correlation analysis. In the discussion, we emphasize the role of diversity in the decompositions achieved by these two models, and present their properties and implementation details to enable the user make informed decisions on the selection of a model along with its associated parameters. Discussions are supported by simulation results to help highlight the main issues in the implementation of these methods.","doi":"10.1109/JPROC.2015.2461624","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7214335","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JPROC.2015.2461624","endPage":"1493","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel7/5/7214335/07206517.pdf","startPage":"1478","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multimodal Data Fusion Using Source Separation: Two Effective Models Based on ICA and IVA and Their Properties","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 August 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7206517/","displayDocTitle":"Multimodal Data Fusion Using Source Separation: Two Effective Models Based on ICA and IVA and Their Properties","volume":"103","issue":"9","accessionNumber":"15399468","dateOfInsertion":"26 August 2015","pubMedId":"26525830","htmlLink":"/document/7206517/","publicationDate":"Sept. 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"NSF-IIS","grantNumber":"1017718"},{"fundingName":"NSF-CCF","grantNumber":"1117056"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000002","fundingName":"National Institutes of Health","grantNumber":"2R01EB000840"},{"fundingName":"NIH COBRE under Grant P20GM103472"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multimodal Data Fusion Using Source Separation: Two Effective Models Based on ICA and IVA and Their Properties","sourcePdf":"jproc-adali-2461624-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.134116S","chronDate":"Sept.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"5","isNumber":"7214335","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"52","xplore-issue":"7214335","articleId":"7206517","onlineDate":"17 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7206533,"authors":[{"name":"Xing Ouyang","affiliation":["Photonic Systems Group, University College Cork, Cork, Ireland"],"bio":{"p":["Authors\u2019 biographies not available at the time of publication."]},"firstName":"Xing","lastName":"Ouyang","id":"38241244100"},{"name":"Wei Jia","affiliation":["Photonic Systems Group, University College Cork, Cork, Ireland"],"bio":{"p":["Authors\u2019 biographies not available at the time of publication."]},"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Jia","id":"37085371846"},{"name":"Paul Gunning","affiliation":["BT Research & Innovation, Suffolk, U.K."],"bio":{"p":["Authors\u2019 biographies not available at the time of publication."]},"firstName":"Paul","lastName":"Gunning","id":"37317346500"},{"name":"Paul D.

An elastically pipelined decoder architecture is used to absorb variations in processing time and each pipeline stage is optimized to use available FPGA primitives. FPGA-specific challenges in managing critical path delays to achieve a target operating frequency of 150 MHz required many architectural novelties, such as exploitation of the sparsity of transformed coefficient matrix, single-cycle reference pixel processing in intra prediction, and flexible 8 x 8 block ordering in deblocking filter/sample adaptive offset filter. A high-throughput latency-aware cache architecture was used to reduce the external dynamic RAM access bandwidth by 70%. This work is compliant with the HEVC main profile at level 5 of the HEVC standard and only consumes 126K lookup tables, 58K registers, and 335 18-kb block RAMs when implemented on Xilinx Zynq 7045.","doi":"10.1109/TCSVT.2015.2469113","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/76/7372356/07206535.pdf","startPage":"236","endPage":"249","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSVT.2015.2469113","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7372356","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7206535","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"4K Real-Time HEVC Decoder on an FPGA","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 August 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7206535/","displayDocTitle":"4K Real-Time HEVC Decoder on an FPGA","volume":"26","issue":"1","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7206535/","publicationDate":"Jan. 2016","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"05 January 2016","accessionNumber":"15689041","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"4K Real-Time HEVC Decoder on an FPGA","sourcePdf":"tcsvt-abeydeera-2469113-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.098557S","chronDate":"Jan.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"76","isNumber":"7372356","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"76","citationCount":"35","xplore-issue":"7372356","articleId":"7206535","onlineDate":"17 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7206536,"authors":[{"name":"Liang Sun","affiliation":["Wireless Networks and Mobile Systems (WiNMoS) Laboratory, Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/7299336/7206536/sun-2469280_print-small.gif","p":["\nLiang Sun (S'08\u2013M'12) received the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST), Hong Kong, in 2010.

The design goal is to improve bit error rate (BER) performance by jointly optimizing the transceiver, data streams, and user ordering, under given total transmit power. We consider a general global objective function, whose elements are Schur-convex functions of the mean square error (MSE) of each user. With nonlinear Tomlinson-Harashima precoding combined with block successive zero-forcing precoding at the transmitter, we show that the optimal nonlinear transceiver leads to favorable diagonal and parallel structures for all users with the general global performance metric. The number of data streams of each user is allowed to be an arbitrary number no more than the rank of the effective channel. We then provide closed-form expressions of the transceiver matrices and optimal power allocation of each user, and analytically characterize the optimal number of data streams of each user for the minimax and average BER metrics. The user ordering is also optimized to further improve the system performance. We also analytically investigate the impact of channel spatial correlation on the performance of our scheme and illustrate why our proposed adaptive strategy can mitigate the performance degradation caused by channel spatial correlation. The superiority of our proposed framework is demonstrated through numerical results.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2015.2469280","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/7299336/07206536.pdf","startPage":"3686","endPage":"3701","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2015.2469280","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7299336","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint Transceiver, Data Streams, and User Ordering Optimization for Nonlinear Multiuser MIMO Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7206536","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 August 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7206536/","displayDocTitle":"Joint Transceiver, Data Streams, and User Ordering Optimization for Nonlinear Multiuser MIMO Systems","volume":"63","issue":"10","publicationDate":"Oct. 2015","accessionNumber":"15524645","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7206536/","dateOfInsertion":"15 October 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Canadian Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council","grantNumber":"RGPIN-2014-06119 and RGPAS-462031-2014"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61271182"},{"fundingName":"973 Program of China","grantNumber":"2013CB336600"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61201174 and 61571107"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004608","fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province","grantNumber":"BK2012325"},{"fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint Transceiver, Data Streams, and User Ordering Optimization for Nonlinear Multiuser MIMO Systems","sourcePdf":"tcomm-wang-2469280-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.151091S","chronDate":"Oct.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"7299336","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"7299336","articleId":"7206536","onlineDate":"17 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7206538,"authors":[{"name":"Yang Li","affiliation":["School of Mathematics and Statistics, Wuhan University, Hubei, China"],"firstName":"Yang","lastName":"Li","id":"37085686234"},{"name":"Xiaoqun Wu","affiliation":["School of Mathematics and Statistics, Wuhan University, Hubei, China"],"firstName":"Xiaoqun","lastName":"Wu","id":"37072523600"},{"name":"Jun-an Lu","affiliation":["School of Mathematics and Statistics, Wuhan University, Hubei, China"],"firstName":"Jun-an","lastName":"Lu","id":"37085491715"},{"name":"Jinhu L\u00fc","affiliation":["Institute of Systems Science, Academy of Mathematics and Systems Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Jinhu","lastName":"L\u00fc","id":"37085491730"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1549-7747"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-3791"}],"articleNumber":"7206538","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":94,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":877},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Circuits and Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieee-cas.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7206538","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Synchronization","Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","Laplace equations","Integrated circuit interconnections","Couplings","Joining processes","Connectors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","Laplace equations","matrix algebra","numerical analysis","power grids","power system interconnection","synchronisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["duplex networks synchronizability","two star networks","nonzero eigenvalues","Laplacian matrix","interlink weight","interlayer connection patterns","interconnected networks","networks of networks","NON","circuit networks design","power grids"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Duplex network","networks of netowrks","synchronizability","interlink weight"]},{"kwd":["Duplex network","interlink weight","networks of networks (NONs)","synchronizability"]}],"abstract":"This brief presents some rules and properties about synchronizability of duplex networks composed of two networks interconnected by two links. For a specific duplex network composed of two star networks, analytical expressions containing the largest and smallest nonzero eigenvalues of the (weighted) Laplacian matrix, the interlink weight, and the network size are given for three different interlayer connection patterns. It is shown that connection patterns have great influence on the ability of the duplex system to synchronize, and connecting high-degree nodes is the most effective way to achieve synchronization, while connecting low-degree nodes is the least. Numerical examples are also provided to verify the effectiveness of theoretical analysis. This work sheds new light on understanding synchronizability of groups of interconnected networks or networks of networks (NONs).

However, in general, reciprocal vectors cannot always be the unit vectors of 1-D samplings for 2-D discrete frequency distributions.

However, limited mismatch data are available for small capacitors. We report mismatch measurement for a 2-fF poly-insulator-poly (PIP) capacitor, which is the smallest reported PIP capacitor to the best of the authors' knowledge. Instead of using complicated custom on-chip circuitry, direct mismatch measurement is demonstrated and verified using Monte Carlo simulations and experimental measurements.

To facilitate the patients' inspection with the EMR system, the diameter of the transmitting coil is enlarged to 69 cm. Due to the large transmitting range, a high quality factor of the Litz-wire transmitting coil is a necessity to ensure the intensity of magnetic field generated efficiently. Thus, this paper builds an analytical model of the transmitting coil, and then, optimizes the parameters of the coil by enlarging the quality factor. The lumped model of the transmitting coil includes three parameters: ac resistance, self-inductance, and stray capacitance. Based on the exact two-dimension solution, the accurate analytical expression of ac resistance is derived. Several transmitting coils of different specifications are utilized to verify this analytical expression, being in good agreements with the measured results except the coils with a large number of strands. Then, the quality factor of transmitting coils can be well predicted with the available analytical expressions of self- inductance and stray capacitance. Owing to the exact estimation of quality factor, the appropriate coil turns of the transmitting coil is set to 18-40 within the restrictions of transmitting circuit and human tissue issues. To supply enough energy for the next generation of the EMR equipped with a \u00d89.5\u00d710.1 mm receiving coil, the coil turns of the transmitting coil is optimally set to 28, which can transfer a maximum power of 750 mW with the remarkable delivering efficiency of 3.55%.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analytical Model and Optimized Design of Power Transmitting Coil for Inductively Coupled Endoscope Robot","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","doi":"10.1109/TBME.2015.2469137","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel7/10/7435363/07206546.pdf","startPage":"694","endPage":"706","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TBME.2015.2469137","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7435363","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7206546","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7206546/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 August 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2016","displayDocTitle":"Analytical Model and Optimized Design of Power Transmitting Coil for Inductively Coupled Endoscope Robot","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"63","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/7206546/","dateOfInsertion":"17 March 2016","publicationDate":"April 2016","accessionNumber":"15869893","pubMedId":"26292335","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"31170968"},{"fundingName":"Shanghai Scientific Project","grantNumber":"14441902800"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analytical Model and Optimized Design of Power Transmitting Coil for Inductively Coupled Endoscope Robot","sourcePdf":"tbme-ke-2469137-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.079924S","chronDate":"April  2016","xplore-pub-id":"10","isNumber":"7435363","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"34","xplore-issue":"7435363","articleId":"7206546","onlineDate":"17 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7206547,"authors":[{"name":"Xinyuan Qian","affiliation":["Virtus IC Design Centre of Excellence, School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/76/7529101/7206547/qian-2469091-small.gif","p":["Xinyuan Qian received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering from Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China, in 2006 and the M.S. degree in electrical engineering from the Technical University of Munich, Munich, Germany, in 2008.

It utilizes a complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS)-active pixel sensor to map the star field onto the focal plane. Starlight is measured and star centroids are calculated to estimate attitude knowledge. In this paper, we present a CMOS image sensor for star centroid measurement in star trackers. To improve sensitivity to low-level starlight, the capacitive transimpedance amplifier pixel is used as the detector. To improve centroiding accuracy, the proposed sensor architecture allows star pixels, pixels that are above a star threshold, to cluster together. The mean value of all the pixels in this cluster is calculated. The star signals are then amplified in relation to this mean value. This increases the signal-to-noise ratio in star regions in line with their starlight intensity. An adaptive region-of-interest readout architecture is also proposed, which reports only star regions instead of the entire frame. The proofof-concept chip, containing a 128\u00d7128 pixel array, was fabricated using AMS 0.35-\u03bcm CMOS Opto process. Each pixel has a size of 31.2 \u00d7 31.2 \u03bcm2. The measurement results show that centroiding accuracy increases with higher centroiding gain.

First, forward and backward motion vectors (MVs) are obtained using an optical flow algorithm, and reconstructed versions of the current and previous frames are generated by our patch-based reconstruction scheme. Using the original and reconstructed versions of the current and previous frames, two mismatch masks are obtained. Then, two versions of the middle frame are generated using a patch-based scheme, with estimated MVs and the current and previous frames. Finally, a middle mask, which identifies the mismatch areas of the two middle frames, is reconstructed. Using these three masks, the best candidates for interpolation are selected and fused to obtain the final middle frame. Due to the patch-based nature of our reconstruction scheme, most of the holes and cracks will be filled. Although there is always a probability of having holes, the size and number of such holes are much smaller than those that would be generated using pixel-based mapping. The rare holes are filled using existing hole-filling algorithms. The experimental results and a comparison of our method with existing algorithms show that our method performs better in terms of both objective and subjective quality of the final interpolated frames.

Traditionally, DMAs are designed and implemented in a multistage (cascade) way, where a proper time delay is used in each stage to form a beampattern of interest. Recently, it was reported that DMAs can be designed by solving a linear system of equations formed from the information about the nulls of the desired beampattern. This paper deals with the problem of beamforming with linear DMAs. Its major contributions are as follows. 1) By using the spatial Z transform, we present some theoretical analysis of both the traditional cascade and new null-constrained DMA beamforming. It is shown that the cascade and null-constrained DMAs of the same order with the same number of sensors are theoretically identical. 2) We develop a two-stage approach to the study of the robust DMA beamformer, which is based on the principle of maximizing the white noise gain (WNG). The first-stage of this approach is in the structure of the traditional non-robust DMA while the second-stage filter is optimized for improving the WNG. 3) Using the two-stage approach, we show that the robust DMA beamformer may introduce extra nulls in the beampattern at high frequencies; particularly, it introduces M - N - 1 extra nulls if the interelement spacing is equal to half of the wavelength, where M and N are the number of sensors and the DMA order, respectively. 4) We develop a method that can solve the extra-null problem while maximizing the WNG in robust DMA beamforming, i.e., a robust solution with a frequency-invariant beampattern.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7206552/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 August 2015","volume":"23","issue":"11","accessionNumber":"15410258","publicationDate":"Nov. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Theoretical Analysis of Differential Microphone Array Beamforming and an Improved Solution","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"NSFC","grantNumber":"61425005"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Theoretical Analysis of Differential Microphone Array Beamforming and an Improved Solution","sourcePdf":"taslp-chen-2469142-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.059005S","chronDate":"Nov.  2015","isNumber":"7140863","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6570655","citationCount":"33","articleId":"7206552","onlineDate":"17 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7206553,"authors":[{"name":"Steffi Knorn","affiliation":["Faculty of Engineering Sciences, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6509490/7784863/7206553/knorn-2468991-small.gif","p":["Steffi Knorn (M'13) received the Dipl.Ing. degree in control engineering from the University of Magdeburg, Magdeburg, Germany, in 2008 and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from the Hamilton Institute at the National University of Ireland Maynooth, Maynooth in 2013.","In 2013, she was a Research Academic at the University of Newcastle, Callaghan, Australia.

The aim is to achieve a global control objective through distributed sensing, communication, computing, and control. It has attracted many researchers from a wide range of disciplines, including the literature of automatic control. This paper aims to give a general framework that is able to accommodate many of these outcomes. Within this framework, the development on this topic is systematically reviewed and the representative outcomes can be sorted out from four aspects: 1) agent dynamics; 2) network topologies; 3) feedback and communication mechanisms; and 4) collective behaviors. Thus, the state-of-the-art approach and technology is described. Moreover, within this framework, further interesting and promising directions on this research topic are envisioned.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7784863","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Control of Network Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Control of Network Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/6509490/7784863/07206553.pdf","doi":"10.1109/TCNS.2015.2468991","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCNS.2015.2468991","startPage":"334","endPage":"347","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Overview: Collective Control of Multiagent Systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 August 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7206553/","displayDocTitle":"Overview: Collective Control of Multiagent Systems","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7206553/","volume":"3","issue":"4","accessionNumber":"16561945","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","publicationDate":"Dec. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000923","fundingName":"Australian Research Council","grantNumber":"DP130103039"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Overview: Collective Control of Multiagent Systems","sourcePdf":"tcns-chen-2468991-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.375546S","chronDate":"Dec.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"6509490","isNumber":"7784863","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6509490","citationCount":"143","xplore-issue":"7784863","articleId":"7206553","onlineDate":"17 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7206555,"authors":[{"name":"Armin Ghorssi Anbaran","affiliation":["Micro/Millimeter-Wave and Wireless Communication Research Laboratory, Radio Communications Center of Excellence, and Institute of Communications Technology and Applied Electromagnetics, Department of Electrical Engineering, Amirkabir University of Technology, Tehran, Iran"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8/7312523/7206555/anbar-2469092-small.gif","p":["Armin Ghorssi Anbaran was born in Tehran, Iran, in 1983.

In a conventional phased-array beamformer, half-wavelength antenna spacing is required in order to achieve a reasonable performance without taking into account the mutual coupling. On the other hand, a conventional electronically steerable parasitic array radiator (ESPAR) system requires smaller antenna spacing, but it provides a lower beamforming performance compared to the phased-array beamformer. The proposed method delivers a beamforming performance close to that of a phased array, without having any constraints on the antenna spacing. In the proposed structure, the RF front-end is connected to each antenna via a tunable load, whereas all antenna elements are also terminated by other tunable reactive loads. Simulation results confirm that the proposed scheme provides better interference suppression and achieves more average capacity compared to ESPAR technique. To further validate the beamforming ability of the proposed method, a testbed with 1/20 of the wavelength antenna spacing was fabricated. A good agreement is observed between the measurement and simulation results.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.2015.2469092","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7312523","startPage":"5026","endPage":"5034","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on

It exhibits better spectrum shape and improves mobility support compared to orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM). Therefore, the availability of efficient hardware implementations becomes of high interest. In this context, a novel pipelined hardware architecture of the transmitter capable of supporting several filter lengths and targeting low complexity is proposed and compared to typical FBMC/OQAM and OFDM implementations. For a short prototype filter, the proposed architecture provides a complexity reduction of 40 to 50% in terms of computational and memory resources with respect to a typical FBMC/OQAM transmitter. In addition, it greatly reduces the complexity gap to OFDM, making this modulation scheme particularly attractive from performance and implementation perspectives.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7206561/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 August 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2016","publicationDate":"Jan. 2016","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7206561/","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","accessionNumber":"15683792","volume":"63","issue":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Low-Complexity Pipelined Architecture for FBMC/OQAM Transmitter","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"FP7","grantNumber":"ICT-317669 METIS"},{"fundingName":"European Union"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low-Complexity Pipelined Architecture for FBMC/OQAM Transmitter","sourcePdf":"tcsii-baghdadi-2468926-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.059883S","chronDate":"Jan.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"8920","isNumber":"7362270","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8920","citationCount":"34","xplore-issue":"7362270","articleId":"7206561","onlineDate":"17 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7206567,"authors":[{"name":"Jia-Ching Wang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, National Central University, Jhongli, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Jia-Ching","lastName":"Wang","id":"37292902200"},{"name":"Chien-Yao Wang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, National Central University, Jhongli, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chien-Yao","lastName":"Wang","id":"37085612724"},{"name":"Tzu-Chiang Tai","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, Providence University, Taichung City, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Tzu-Chiang","lastName":"Tai","id":"37085627083"},{"name":"Min Shih","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, National Central University, Jhongli, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Min","lastName":"Shih","id":"37085411499"},{"name":"Shao-Chieh Huang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, National Central University, Jhongli, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Shao-Chieh","lastName":"Huang","id":"37085641775"},{"name":"Ying-Chuan Chen","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, National Central University, Jhongli, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Ying-Chuan","lastName":"Chen","id":"37085652713"},{"name":"Yan-Yu Lin","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, National Central University, Jhongli, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Yan-Yu","lastName":"Lin","id":"37085425073"},{"name":"Li-Xun Lian","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, National Central University, Jhongli, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Li-Xun","lastName":"Lian","id":"37085471323"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1549-7747"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-3791"}],"articleNumber":"7206567","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":792},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Circuits and Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieee-cas.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Blind source separation","Computer architecture","Very large scale integration","Filtering","Approximation methods","Adaptive filters","Algorithm design and analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["approximation theory","blind source separation","circuit optimisation","CMOS integrated circuits","convolution","digital filters","integrated circuit design","piecewise linear techniques","stochastic processes","VLSI"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["logistic sigmoid","circuit design","piecewise-linear approximation scheme","semicustom design","CMOS technology","Infomax-driven stochastic learning rules","scaling factor computation modules","Infomax filtering modules","information maximization","VLSI design","very-large-scale integration architecture design","CBSS chip design","convolutive blind source separation","size 90 nm","size 0.54 mm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Blind source separation","convolutive mixing","convolutive blind source separation","information maximization","VLSI"]},{"kwd":["Blind source separation (BSS)","convolutive BSS (CBSS)","convolutive mixing","information maximization (Infomax)","very-large-scale integration (VLSI)"]}],"abstract":"This brief presents an efficient very-large-scale integration architecture design for convolutive blind source separation (CBSS).

This paper proposes a pre-coding method, which provides high-space channel correlation for the improved performance over terrestrial broadcasting channels when the MIMO spatial multiplexing (SM) is adopted for digital video broadcasting-next generation handheld systems. When signals with two different modulation orders are transmitted through two antennas, a method that is based on non-uniform power is also proposed for improved reception performance. To optimize the proposed method, phase shifting values for the pre-coding method and appropriate non-uniform power ratio are obtained. These obtained parameters are applied to a terrestrial broadcasting system, and then the performance improvement over the conventional SM is shown through computer simulations.","doi":"10.1109/TBC.2015.2459659","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Broadcasting","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Broadcasting","pdfPath":"/iel7/11/7337347/07206571.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TBC.2015.2459659","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7337347","startPage":"729","endPage":"733","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improved Polarized 2x2 MIMO Spatial Multiplexing Method for DVB-NGH System","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7206571","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Improved Polarized 2x2 MIMO Spatial Multiplexing Method for DVB-NGH System","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7206571/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 August 2015","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"61","issue":"4","publicationDate":"Dec. 2015","accessionNumber":"15660702","dateOfInsertion":"04 December 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7206571/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"ICT Research and Development Program of MSIP/IITP \u201cDevelopment of Service and Transmission Technology for Convergent Realistic Broadcast\u201d","grantNumber":"R0101-15-294"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improved Polarized 2x2 MIMO Spatial Multiplexing Method for DVB-NGH System","sourcePdf":"tbc-seo-2459659-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.110092S","chronDate":"Dec.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"11","isNumber":"7337347","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"11","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"7337347","articleId":"7206571","onlineDate":"17 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7206572,"authors":[{"name":"Taehui Na","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Yonsei University, Seoul, Korea"],"firstName":"Taehui","lastName":"Na","id":"37072572600"},{"name":"Jisu Kim","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Yonsei University, Seoul, Korea"],"firstName":"Jisu","lastName":"Kim","id":"37600795900"},{"name":"Jung Pill Kim","affiliation":["Qualcomm Inc., San Diego, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Jung Pill","lastName":"Kim","id":"37966226400"},{"name":"Seung H.

The Laplacian or L1 density function can be expressed as a superposition of an infinite number of Gaussian distributions. Under this expression, a Bayesian inference can be established based on the variational expectation maximization approach. All the key parameters in the probabilistic model can be learned by the proposed variational algorithm. It has experimentally been demonstrated that the newly introduced hidden variables in the superposition can serve as an effective indicator for data outliers. Experiments on some publicly available databases show that the performance of L1-2DPPCA has largely been improved after identifying and removing sample outliers, resulting in more accurate image reconstruction than the existing PCA-based methods. The performance of feature extraction of the proposed method generally outperforms other existing algorithms in terms of reconstruction errors and classification accuracy.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Image Outlier Detection and Feature Extraction via L1-Norm-Based 2D Probabilistic PCA","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","doi":"10.1109/TIP.2015.2469136","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/83/7271151/07206576.pdf","startPage":"4834","endPage":"4846","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIP.2015.2469136","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7271151","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7206576","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7206576/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 August 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2015","displayDocTitle":"Image Outlier Detection and Feature Extraction via L1-Norm-Based 2D Probabilistic PCA","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"24","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/7206576/","dateOfInsertion":"21 September 2015","publicationDate":"Dec. 2015","accessionNumber":"15472738","pubMedId":"26292341","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of Beijing, China","grantNumber":"4132013"},{"fundingName":"Australian Research Council Discovery Projects Funding Scheme","grantNumber":"DP130100364"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61171169, 61133003, 61370119 and 61390510"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Image Outlier Detection and Feature Extraction via L1-Norm-Based 2D Probabilistic PCA","sourcePdf":"tip-sun-2469136-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.098721S","chronDate":"Dec.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"83","isNumber":"7271151","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"32","xplore-issue":"7271151","articleId":"7206576","onlineDate":"17 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7206577,"authors":[{"name":"A.

Besides, the advances in smart grid technologies motivate the electricity utility companies toward developing demand response (DR) programs to influence the electricity usage behavior of the customers. In this paper, we modify the conventional DR programs in smart grid to develop an integrated DR (IDR) program for multiple energy carriers fed into an energy hub in smart grid, namely a smart energy (S. E.) hub. In our model, the IDR program is formulated for the electricity and natural gas networks. The interaction among the S. E. hubs is modeled as an ordinal potential game with unique Nash equilibrium. Besides, a distributed algorithm is developed to determine the equilibrium. Simulation results show that in addition to load shifting, the customers in the S. E. hubs can participate in the IDR program by switching the energy resources (e.g., from the electricity to the natural gas) during the peak hours. Moreover, the IDR program can increase the S. E. hubs' daily payoff and the utility companies' daily profit.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"From Demand Response in Smart Grid Toward Integrated Demand Response in Smart Energy Hub","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid","doi":"10.1109/TSG.2015.2464374","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid","pdfPath":"/iel7/5165411/7410169/07206579.pdf","startPage":"650","endPage":"658","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSG.2015.2464374","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7410169","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7206579","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7206579/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 August 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2016","displayDocTitle":"From Demand Response in Smart Grid Toward Integrated Demand Response in Smart Energy Hub","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"7","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/7206579/","dateOfInsertion":"18 February 2016","publicationDate":"March 2016","accessionNumber":"15786879","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"From Demand Response in Smart Grid Toward Integrated Demand Response in Smart Energy Hub","sourcePdf":"tsg-bahrami-2464374-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.078689S","chronDate":"March  2016","xplore-pub-id":"5165411","isNumber":"7410169","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5165411","citationCount":"143","xplore-issue":"7410169","articleId":"7206579","onlineDate":"17 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7206581,"authors":[{"name":"Paolo Carbone","affiliation":["Department of Engineering, University of Perugia, Perugia, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/19/7317673/7206581/carbo-2463331-small.gif","p":["Paolo Carbone (M\u201994\u2013SM\u201909\u2013F\u201915) received the Laurea and Ph.D. degrees from the University of Padua, Padua, Italy, in 1990 and 1994, respectively.","He was a Researcher with the Third University of Rome, Rome, Italy, from 1994 to 1997, and the University of Perugia, Perugia, Italy, from 1997 to 2002.

A standard approach for its solution makes use of a least squares estimator (LSE) that, however, does not perform optimally in the presence of quantization errors. In fact, if the quantization error cannot be modeled as an additive noise source, as it often happens in practice, the LSE returns biased estimates. In this paper, we consider the estimation of the amplitude of a noisy sine wave after quantization. The proposed technique is based on a uniform distribution of signal phases and it does not require that the quantizer has equally spaced transition levels. The experimental results show that this technique removes the estimation bias associated with the usage of the LSE and that it is sufficiently robust with respect to small uncertainties in the known values of transition levels.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Estimation","Noise","Quantization (signal)","Analog-digital conversion"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["amplitude estimation","electric variables measurement","least mean squares methods","measurement uncertainty","nonlinear estimation","quantisation (signal)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["sine wave amplitude measurement accuracy","quantized sample sequence","least squares estimator","LSE","biased estimation","nonlinearly quantization data","uniform signal phase distribution","measurement uncertainty"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Estimation","identification","nonlinear estimation problems","nonlinear quantizers","quantization."]},{"kwd":["Estimation","identification","nonlinear estimation problems","nonlinear quantizers","quantization"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TIM.2015.2463331","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement","pdfPath":"/iel7/19/7317673/07206581.pdf","startPage":"3201","endPage":"3208","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7317673","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIM.2015.2463331","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Accurate Sine-Wave Amplitude Measurements Using Nonlinearly Quantized Data","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7206581","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Accurate Sine-Wave Amplitude Measurements Using Nonlinearly Quantized Data","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7206581/","volume":"64","issue":"12","publicationDate":"Dec. 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7206581/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"15583776","dateOfInsertion":"06 November 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 August 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Fund for Scientific Research"},{"fundingName":"Flemish Government Methusalem"},{"fundingName":"Belgian Government through the Interuniversity Poles of Attraction (VII) Program"},{"fundingName":"European Research Council Advanced Grant SNLSID","grantNumber":"320378"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Accurate Sine-Wave Amplitude Measurements Using Nonlinearly Quantized Data","sourcePdf":"tim-carbone-2463331-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.07958S","chronDate":"Dec.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"19","isNumber":"7317673","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"19","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7317673","articleId":"7206581","onlineDate":"17 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-30"},{"_id":7206589,"authors":[{"name":"Lei Chen","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Universal Wireless Communications, Ministry of Education, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/7513343/7206589/chen-2469149-small.gif","p":["\n\nLei Chen received the B.S. degree in communication engineering from \nBeijing University of Posts and Telecommunications (BUPT), Beijing, China, in 2011.

Another emerging technology for next-generation wireless networks is in-band full-duplex (FD) communications. Due to its promising performance, FD communication has been considered to be an effective way of achieving self-backhauls for small cells. In this paper, we introduce wireless virtualization into small-cell networks and propose a virtualized small-cell network architecture with FD self-backhauls. We formulate the virtual-resource-allocation problem in virtualized small-cell networks with FD self-backhauls as an optimization problem. Since the formulated problem is a mixed combinatorial and nonconvex optimization problem, its computational complexity is high. Moreover, the centralized scheme may suffer from signaling overhead, outdated dynamics information, and scalability issues. To solve it efficiently, we divide the original problem into two subproblems. For the first subproblem, we transfer it to a convex optimization problem and then solve it by an efficient alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM)-based distributed algorithm. The second subproblem is a convex problem, which can be solved by each infrastructure provider. Extensive simulations are conducted with different system configurations to show the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2015.2469149","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2015.2469149","startPage":"5410","endPage":"5423","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/25/7513343/07206589.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7513343","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Distributed Virtual Resource Allocation in Small-Cell Networks With Full-Duplex Self-Backhauls and Virtualization","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7206589/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 August 2015","displayDocTitle":"Distributed Virtual Resource Allocation in Small-Cell Networks With Full-Duplex Self-Backhauls and Virtualization","volume":"65","issue":"7","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"14 July 2016","accessionNumber":"16141225","publicationDate":"July 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7206589/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation","grantNumber":"61271182 and  61302080"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distributed Virtual Resource Allocation in Small-Cell Networks With Full-Duplex Self-Backhauls and Virtualization","sourcePdf":"tvt-yu-2469149-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.140288S","chronDate":"July  2016","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"7513343","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"50","xplore-issue":"7513343","articleId":"7206589","onlineDate":"17 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7206597,"authors":[{"name":"Constanza Ahumada","affiliation":["Faculty of Mathematical and Physical Sciences, University of Chile, Santiago, Chile"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5165411/7456360/7206597/ahuma-2461190-small.gif","p":["Constanza Ahumada was born in Santiago, Chile.

A disadvantage of this method is that in steady state the frequency of the MG deviates from the nominal value and has to be restored using a secondary control system (SCS). The signal obtained at the output of the SCS is transmitted using a communication channel to the generation sources in the MG, correcting the frequency. However, communication channels are prone to time delays, which should be considered in the design of the SCS; otherwise, the operation of the MG could be compromised. In this paper, two new SCSs control schemes are discussed to deal with this issue: (1) a model predictive controller (MPC); and (2) a Smith predictor-based controller. The performance of both control methodologies are compared with that obtained using a conventional proportional integral-based SCS using simulation work. Stability analysis based on small signal models and participation factors is also realized. It is concluded that in terms of robustness, the MPC has better performance.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7206597/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 August 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2016","volume":"7","issue":"3","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"15934883","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","publicationDate":"May 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7206597/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Secondary Control Strategies for Frequency Restoration in Islanded Microgrids With Consideration of Communication Delays","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002850","fundingName":"Fondo Nacional de Desarrollo Cient\u00edfico y Tecnol\u00f3gico","grantNumber":"1140775"},{"fundingName":"Advanced Center for Electrical and Electronic Engineering"},{"fundingName":"Basal Project","grantNumber":"FB0008"},{"fundingName":"Fondequip","grantNumber":"EQM130058"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Secondary Control Strategies for Frequency Restoration in Islanded Microgrids With Consideration of Communication Delays","sourcePdf":"tsg-saez-2461190-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.125803S","chronDate":"May  2016","xplore-pub-id":"5165411","isNumber":"7456360","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5165411","citationCount":"167","xplore-issue":"7456360","articleId":"7206597","onlineDate":"17 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-26"},{"_id":7206598,"authors":[{"name":"Flavia Tauro","affiliation":["Dipartimento per l\u2019Innovazione nei Sistemi Biologici, Agroalimentari e Forestali, University of Tuscia, Viterbo, Italy"],"firstName":"Flavia","lastName":"Tauro","id":"37085684890"},{"name":"Christopher Pagano","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, Polytechnic School of Engineering, New York University, Brooklyn, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Christopher","lastName":"Pagano","id":"37085682417"},{"name":"Paul Phamduy","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, Polytechnic School of Engineering, New York University, Brooklyn, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Paul","lastName":"Phamduy","id":"37085359811"},{"name":"Salvatore Grimaldi","affiliation":["Dipartimento per l\u2019Innovazione nei Sistemi Biologici, Agroalimentari e Forestali, University of Tuscia, Viterbo, Italy"],"firstName":"Salvatore","lastName":"Grimaldi","id":"37085695029"},{"name":"Maurizio Porfiri","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, Polytechnic School of Engineering, New York University, Brooklyn, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Maurizio","lastName":"Porfiri","id":"37300354000"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1083-4435"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-014X"}],"articleNumber":"7206598","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":46,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":996},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Industrial Electronics Society","url":"http://www.ewh.ieee.org/soc/ies/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"ASME Dynamic Systems and Control Division","url":"http://divisions.asme.org/dscd"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"  IEEE Robotics and Automation Society","url":"http://www.ncsu.edu/IEEE-RAS/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7206598","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Vehicles","Cameras","Harmonic analysis","Payloads","Mechatronics","Monitoring","Vibrations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["autonomous aerial vehicles","robot vision"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["large-scale particle image velocimetry","unmanned aerial vehicle","LSPIV implementations","surface flow velocities","natural watersheds","water stream","human operators","water flow systems","quadrotor","camera lens"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Environmental monitoring","particle image velocimetry","quadrotor","unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV)"]},{"kwd":["Environmental monitoring","particle image velocimetry","quadrotor","unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV)"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TMECH.2015.2408112","publicationTitle":"IEEE/ASME Transactions on Mechatronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE/ASME Transactions on Mechatronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/3516/7305854/07206598.pdf","startPage":"3269","endPage":"3275","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMECH.2015.2408112","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7305854","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Large-Scale Particle Image Velocimetry From an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle","abstract":"Large-scale particle image velocimetry (LSPIV) enables nonintrusive and continuous characterization of surface flow velocities in natural watersheds. However, current LSPIV implementations are based on hxed cameras that only allow for surface flow monitoring at a limited number of locations on the water stream. This paper seeks to leverage the growing held of unmanned aerial vehicles to transform LSPIV practice, by enabling rapid characterization of large water flow systems in areas that may be difhcult to access by human operators. Toward this aim, a lightweight and low cost quadrotor is developed to host a digital acquisition system for LSPIV. A gimbal is realized in house to maintain the camera lens orthogonal with respect to the water surface, thus preventing image orthorectihcation.

The signalling molecules diffuse freely in the medium. The receiver is assumed to consist of a number of receptors, which can be in ON or OFF state. When the signalling molecules arrive at the receiver, they react with the receptors and switch them from OFF to ON state probabilistically. The receptors remain ON for a random amount of time before reverting to the OFF state. This paper assumes that the receiver uses the continuous history of receptor state to infer the transmitted symbol. Furthermore, it assumes that the transmitter uses two transmission symbols and approaches the decoding problem from the maximum a posteriori (MAP) framework. Specifically, the decoding is realized by calculating the logarithm of the ratio of the posteriori probabilities of the two transmission symbols, or log-MAP ratio. A contribution of this paper is to show that the computation of log-MAP ratio can be performed by an analog filter. The receiver can therefore use the output of this filter to decide which symbol has been sent. This analog filter provides insight on what information is important for decoding. In particular, the timing at which the receptors switch from OFF to ON state, the number of OFF receptors and the mean number of signalling molecules at the receiver are important. Numerical examples are used to illustrate the property of this decoding method.","doi":"10.1109/TNANO.2015.2469301","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7322313","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNANO.2015.2469301","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nanotechnology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nanotechnology","pdfPath":"/iel7/7729/7322313/07206607.pdf","startPage":"1054","endPage":"1067","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Maximum <i>A-Posteriori</i> Decoding for Diffusion-Based Molecular Communication Using Analog Filters","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 August 2015","displayDocTitle":"Maximum <i>A-Posteriori</i> Decoding for Diffusion-Based Molecular Communication Using Analog Filters","volume":"14","issue":"6","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2015","dateOfInsertion":"09 November 2015","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7206607/","publicationDate":"Nov. 2015","accessionNumber":"15587671","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7206607/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Maximum <italic>A-Posteriori</italic> Decoding for Diffusion-Based Molecular Communication Using Analog Filters","sourcePdf":"tnano-chou-2469301-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.115392S","chronDate":"Nov.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"7729","isNumber":"7322313","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7729","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"7322313","articleId":"7206607","onlineDate":"17 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":7206609,"authors":[{"name":"Run Chen","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering-Electrophysics, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4/7336577/7206609/7206609-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Run Chen (S\u201907) received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in electronic engineering from Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, in 2006 and 2008, respectively.

The measured peak INL and DNL of 0.64 LSB and 0.58 LSB, respectively, after comparator offset calibration prove successful interpolation operation. The measured SNDR and SFDR were 38.12 dB and 49.05 dB, respectively, with a 1.08GHz input at 2 GS/s operation while consuming 20.7 mW of total power. This ADC achieves a figure of merit of 157 fJ/conversion-step with a Nyquist input at 2 GS/s.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7206614/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 August 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2015","volume":"50","issue":"10","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"15489258","dateOfInsertion":"28 September 2015","publicationDate":"Oct. 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7206614/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A 65 nm CMOS 7b 2 GS/s 20.7 mW Flash ADC With Cascaded Latch Interpolation","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A 65 nm CMOS 7b 2 GS/s 20.7 mW Flash ADC With Cascaded Latch Interpolation","sourcePdf":"jssc-ryu-2460371-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.078086S","chronDate":"Oct.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"4","isNumber":"7279217","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"28","xplore-issue":"7279217","articleId":"7206614","onlineDate":"17 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7206616,"authors":[{"name":"Hans Meyvaert","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, ESAT-MICAS, Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, Heverlee, Belgium"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4/7336577/7206616/7206616-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Hans Meyvaert (S\u201909) was born in Sint-Truiden, Belgium, in 1985.

SC converters, unlike their inductive buck counterparts, do not rely on the pulse-width modulation (PWM) duty cycle to set the voltage conversion ratio (VCR) as this is determined by the SC converter topology. Consequently, SC DC-DC converters do not require a very low duty cycle, resulting in a short ton for the full-input-voltage-rated high-side switch and significant driver power consumption. Instead, a two-phase SC converter is found to be an excellent candidate for high-ratio voltage conversion as it maintains a 50% duty cycle and exchanges few components of high voltage rating with more that are rated for lower voltage.","doi":"10.1109/JSSC.2015.2461600","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel7/4/7336577/07206616.pdf","startPage":"2849","endPage":"2860","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSSC.2015.2461600","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7336577","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Light-Load-Efficient 11/1 Switched-Capacitor DC-DC Converter With 94.7% Efficiency While Delivering 100 mW at 3.3 V","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7206616","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 August 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7206616/","displayDocTitle":"A Light-Load-Efficient 11/1 Switched-Capacitor DC-DC Converter With 94.7% Efficiency While Delivering 100 mW at 3.3 V","volume":"50","issue":"12","publicationDate":"Dec. 2015","accessionNumber":"15618352","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7206616/","dateOfInsertion":"24 November 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Light-Load-Efficient 11/1 Switched-Capacitor DC-DC Converter With 94.7% Efficiency While Delivering 100 mW at 3.3 V","sourcePdf":"jssc-meyvaert-2461600-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.136152S","chronDate":"Dec.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"4","isNumber":"7336577","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"30","xplore-issue":"7336577","articleId":"7206616","onlineDate":"17 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7206620,"authors":[{"name":"Ib\u00e9ria Medeiros","affiliation":["LaSIGE, Universidade de Lisboa, Portugal"],"bio":{"p":["Ib\u00e9ria Medeiros is a Ph.D. student at the Department of Informatics, Faculty of Sciences, University of Lisboa.

An important part of that problem derives from vulnerable source code, often written in unsafe languages like PHP. Source code static analysis tools are a solution to find vulnerabilities, but they tend to generate false positives, and require considerable effort for programmers to manually fix the code. We explore the use of a combination of methods to discover vulnerabilities in source code with fewer false positives. We combine taint analysis, which finds candidate vulnerabilities, with data mining, to predict the existence of false positives. This approach brings together two approaches that are apparently orthogonal: humans coding the knowledge about vulnerabilities (for taint analysis), joined with the seemingly orthogonal approach of automatically obtaining that knowledge (with machine learning, for data mining). Given this enhanced form of detection, we propose doing automatic code correction by inserting fixes in the source code. Our approach was implemented in the WAP tool, and an experimental evaluation was performed with a large set of PHP applications. Our tool found 388 vulnerabilities in 1.4 million lines of code. Its accuracy and precision were approximately 5% better than PhpMinerII's and 45% better than Pixy's.","doi":"10.1109/TR.2015.2457411","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7422884","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TR.2015.2457411","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Reliability","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Reliability","pdfPath":"/iel7/24/7422884/07206620.pdf","startPage":"54","endPage":"69","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Detecting and Removing Web Application Vulnerabilities with Static Analysis and Data Mining","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 August 2015","displayDocTitle":"Detecting and Removing Web Application Vulnerabilities with Static Analysis and Data Mining","volume":"65","issue":"1","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2016","dateOfInsertion":"01 March 2016","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7206620/","publicationDate":"March 2016","accessionNumber":"15822946","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7206620/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Detecting and Removing Web Application Vulnerabilities with Static Analysis and Data Mining","sourcePdf":"tr-medeiros-2457411-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.164136S","chronDate":"March  2016","xplore-pub-id":"24","isNumber":"7422884","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"24","citationCount":"42","xplore-issue":"7422884","articleId":"7206620","onlineDate":"17 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7206819,"authors":[{"name":"Shlomi Arnon","affiliation":["Satellite and Wireless Communication Laboratory, Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, Beer Sheva, Israel"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/49/7206775/7206819/arnon-2444491-small.gif","p":["\n\nShlomi Arnon (M'00\u2013SM'00) is a Professor at the Department of \nElectrical and Computer Engineering, Ben-Gurion University (BGU), Israel.

Various forms of OWC can be used to augment RF capacity at both access and backhaul/fronthaul levels. Despite the major advantages and various application areas, the widespread deployment of OWC is delayed by several challenges, such as the demand to maintain strict line-of-sight alignment between transmitter and receiver in long range outdoor applications; the need to combat attenuation due to adverse weather conditions such as fog, cloud, and turbulence; to modulate light emitting diodes at high frequencies without distortion at indoor visible light communication (VLC) applications and retaining power levels within the eye safety limits for laser transmitters and comfortable illumination levels for LED transmitters.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7206775","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/49/7206775/07206819.pdf","doi":"10.1109/JSAC.2015.2444491","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2015.2444491","startPage":"1733","endPage":"1737","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Guest Editorial: Optical Wireless Communications","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 August 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7206819/","displayDocTitle":"Guest Editorial: Optical Wireless Communications","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7206819/","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"33","issue":"9","dateOfInsertion":"17 August 2015","publicationDate":"Sept. 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Guest Editorial: Optical Wireless Communications","sourcePdf":"jsac-2444491-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.044627S","chronDate":"Sept.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"7206775","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"7206775","articleId":"7206819","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7206826,"authors":[{"name":"Johannes Blanckenstein","affiliation":["Dept.

We present an overview of state-of-the-art low-power receivers and relate their characteristics to requirements for different application areas. We compare low-power receivers to duty-cycled transceivers and present applications depending on them. For this, we use power consumption, sensitivity, and data rate as key performance figures for low-power receivers.

This paper introduces a homogeneous multi-domain design methodology which blurs analog and digital boundaries and enables the design of etherogeneous electrical and non-electrical building blocks. The methodology is based on the identification of four fundamental quantities (quadrivium), namely signal-to-noise ratio, signal-to-interference ratio, impedance and consumed energy, applicable to both electrical and multiphysics components. Based on their constraining and their propagation on an ensemble of transactions in time domain, these four elements can be used across different domains (digital or analog), and permit architects to extract internal features, so that these are intrinsically oriented to successive physical and technology-related implementation and modeling. With example application cases, we show that these four quantities in turn define design constraints of electrical and nonelectrical internal units. After presenting an electronic design example, to show applicability in multiple physical domains, the paper discusses and applies the quadrivium also in the context of a MEMS sensor and microfluidic components.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Towards Multi-Domain and Multi-Physical Electronic Design","publicationTitle":"IEEE Circuits and Systems Magazine","doi":"10.1109/MCAS.2015.2450635","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Circuits and Systems Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel7/7384/7206821/07206833.pdf","startPage":"18","endPage":"43","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MCAS.2015.2450635","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7206821","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7206833","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7206833/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 August 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"thirdquarter  2015","displayDocTitle":"Towards Multi-Domain and Multi-Physical Electronic Design","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"15","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/7206833/","dateOfInsertion":"17 August 2015","publicationDate":"thirdquarter 2015","accessionNumber":"15381899","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Towards Multi-Domain and Multi-Physical Electronic Design","sourcePdf":"15mcas03-crepaldi-2450635-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.15638S","chronDate":"thirdquarter  2015","xplore-pub-id":"7384","isNumber":"7206821","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7384","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"7206821","articleId":"7206833","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7206947,"authors":[{"name":"Pancheewa Arayacheeppreecha","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok, Thailand"],"firstName":"Pancheewa","lastName":"Arayacheeppreecha","id":"37085457139"},{"name":"Suree Pumrin","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok, Thailand"],"firstName":"Suree","lastName":"Pumrin","id":"37330309900"},{"name":"Boonchuay Supmonchai","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok, Thailand"],"firstName":"Boonchuay","lastName":"Supmonchai","id":"37351183800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-7961-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-7960-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7206947","dbTime":"15 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":158},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Transforms","Computer architecture","Hardware","Encoding","Throughput","Video coding","Field programmable gate arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","logic design","quadtrees","transforms","video codecs","video coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["flexible input transform architecture","high efficiency video coding","HEVC encoder","field programmable gate arrays","FPGA architecture","1D forward integer transform","residual quadtree partitioning","configuration encoding scheme"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["High Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC)","Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA)","integer transform","video coding","architecture"]}],"abstract":"This paper proposes an FPGA architecture for the 1-D forward integer transform of the High Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC), which is the latest video coding standard.

The design gives a high throughput of 1,640 Msamples/s independent of input combination, which is sufficient to encode 8K (7680\u00d74320) videos in real-time, 30 fps.","doi":"10.1109/ECTICon.2015.7206947","publicationTitle":"2015 12th International Conference on Electrical Engineering/Electronics, Computer, Telecommunications and Information Technology (ECTI-CON)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 12th International Conference on Electrical Engineering/Electronics, Computer, Telecommunications and Information Technology (ECTI-CON)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7180538/7206924/07206947.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ECTICon.2015.7206947","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7206924","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7206947","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Flexible input transform architecture for HEVC encoder on FPGA","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-27 June 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7206947/","displayDocTitle":"Flexible input transform architecture for HEVC encoder on FPGA","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7206947/","publicationDate":"June 2015","dateOfInsertion":"20 August 2015","conferenceDate":"24-27 June 2015","accessionNumber":"15384242","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Flexible input transform architecture for HEVC encoder on FPGA","confLoc":"Hua Hin, Thailand","sourcePdf":"1053.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050499S","chronDate":"24-27 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7180538","isNumber":"7206924","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7180538","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7206924","articleId":"7206947","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7206954,"authors":[{"name":"Jidapa Hansawangkit","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Mahidol University, Nakhon Pathom, Thailand"],"firstName":"Jidapa","lastName":"Hansawangkit","id":"37085627862"},{"name":"Tatcha Chulajata","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Mahidol University, Nakhon Pathom, Thailand"],"firstName":"Tatcha","lastName":"Chulajata","id":"37726793500"},{"name":"Pongsatorn Sedtheetorn","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Mahidol University, Nakhon Pathom, Thailand"],"firstName":"Pongsatorn","lastName":"Sedtheetorn","id":"37298539600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-7961-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-7960-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7206954","dbTime":"15 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":101},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interference","Femtocells","Signal to noise ratio","Noise measurement","Bandwidth","Optimization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["femtocellular radio","optimisation","radiofrequency interference","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["new rate optimization technique","femtocell networks","wireless communication","macro cell network","cochannel deployment","signal quality degradation","signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio","SINR","rate optimization planning","interfering power","spreading gain","background noise power"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["femto cell","co-tier interference","co-channel deployment","signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR)"]}],"abstract":"Deployment of a femto cell network is one of the best ways to solve the areas which have some dead spots for wireless communication in macro cell network. However, we have to concern interferences because femto cells often share the same spectrum, which is calles as co-channel deployment, with their macro cell due to limitation. In this paper, we focus on co-tier interferences that occur between them and causes of signal quality degradation of each femto cells. As a result, we propose data rate's maximization of active femto cell to guarantee signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR). This benefits rate optimization planning with the consideration of key parameters, i.e. number of neighboring femto cells, interfering power, allowance SINR, spreading gain and background noise power.","doi":"10.1109/ECTICon.2015.7206954","publicationTitle":"2015 12th International Conference on Electrical Engineering/Electronics, Computer, Telecommunications and Information Technology (ECTI-CON)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 12th International Conference on Electrical Engineering/Electronics, Computer, Telecommunications and Information Technology (ECTI-CON)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7180538/7206924/07206954.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ECTICon.2015.7206954","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7206924","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A new rate optimization technique for femtocell networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7206954","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-27 June 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7206954/","displayDocTitle":"A new rate optimization technique for femtocell networks","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15384308","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7206954/","conferenceDate":"24-27 June 2015","dateOfInsertion":"20 August 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new rate optimization technique for femtocell networks","confLoc":"Hua Hin, Thailand","sourcePdf":"1063.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063393S","chronDate":"24-27 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7180538","isNumber":"7206924","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7180538","xplore-issue":"7206924","articleId":"7206954","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7206996,"authors":[{"name":"Worawat Ladarat","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering Faculty of Engineering, King Mongkut's University of Technology, Thonburi, Bangkok, Thailand"],"firstName":"Worawat","lastName":"Ladarat","id":"37085721512"},{"name":"Sumate Naetiladdanon","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering Faculty of Engineering, King Mongkut's University of Technology, Thonburi, Bangkok, Thailand"],"firstName":"Sumate","lastName":"Naetiladdanon","id":"37640330800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-7961-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-7960-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7206996","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":161},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Smart grids","Smart meters","Automatic meter reading","Wires","Modems","GSM","Databases"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["smart meters","smart power grids"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["PEA automatic meter reading system","Provincial Electricity Authority","Thailand","AMR project information","smart meter number","advanced metering infrastructure system","AMI system","smart grid"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Automatic Meter Reading","Smart Grid","Provincial Electricity Authority"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7206996","abstract":"This paper summarizes the progress of Automatic Meter Reading (AMR) system of Provincial Electricity Authority (PEA) Thailand.

These exclusive features of STT MRAMs are rapidly gaining attention of memory designers. They are strong contenders for futuristic embedded memory applications. Researchers have been primarily focusing on further decreasing the switching energy and increasing the integration density, while retaining the much important stability (i.e. non-volatility over large periods). Proceeding with a similar intent, this paper explores the next generation STT MRAM driven by asymmetric vertical silicon nano-wire gate all around (GAA) select device. The perpendicular magnetic anisotropy magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ) multilayer structure is stacked above the select device. The inherent asymmetry in critical switching current of an MTJ is exploited by a matching asymmetric drive current select device that achieves a significant reduction in power dissipation. The analysis is carried out using SPICE simulations with calibrated Verilog-A models of vertical GAA device and perpendicular magnetic anisotropy MTJ. Encouragingly, the proposed design lowers the power dissipation up to 30% with a minimum cell area of 4F\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n (F is the feature size).","doi":"10.1109/ECTICon.2015.7207004","publicationTitle":"2015 12th International Conference on Electrical Engineering/Electronics, Computer, Telecommunications and Information Technology (ECTI-CON)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 12th International Conference on Electrical Engineering/Electronics, Computer, Telecommunications and Information Technology (ECTI-CON)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7180538/7206924/07207004.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ECTICon.2015.7207004","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7206924","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Low power STT MRAM cell with asymmetric drive current vertical GAA select device","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Low power STT MRAM cell with asymmetric drive current vertical GAA select device","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"20 August 2015","accessionNumber":"15384303","publicationDate":"June 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7207004/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7207004/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-27 June 2015","conferenceDate":"24-27 June 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low power STT MRAM cell with asymmetric drive current vertical GAA select device","confLoc":"Hua Hin, Thailand","sourcePdf":"1138.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054376S","chronDate":"24-27 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7180538","isNumber":"7206924","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7180538","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7206924","articleId":"7207004","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7207016,"authors":[{"name":"Thantip Thaikerd","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering Faculty of Engineering, Kasetsart University, Bangkok, Thailand"],"firstName":"Thantip","lastName":"Thaikerd","id":"37085640732"},{"name":"Wiroonsak Santipach","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering Faculty of Engineering, Kasetsart University, Bangkok, Thailand"],"firstName":"Wiroonsak","lastName":"Santipach","id":"37270671600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-7961-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-7960-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7207016","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":238},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Upper bound","Transmitting antennas","Signal to noise ratio","Antenna arrays","Layout","Array signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","mobile antennas","mobile communication","radio links","receiving antennas","transmitting antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optimizing transmit antenna placement","downlink distributed antenna systems","zero forcing beamforming","DAS","transmit antennas","circular layout and","mobile user","single receive antenna","zero forcing beamforming transmission","base station","optimal radius","colocated antenna system","CAS"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Distributed antenna system (DAS)","circular antenna layout","downlink","zero-forcing beamforming","nonuniform user density","sum-rate analysis"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On optimizing transmit antenna placement for downlink distributed antenna systems with zero-forcing beamforming","doi":"10.1109/ECTICon.2015.7207016","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7206924","endPage":"5","publicationTitle":"2015 12th International Conference on Electrical Engineering/Electronics, Computer, Telecommunications and Information Technology (ECTI-CON)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 12th International Conference on Electrical Engineering/Electronics, Computer, Telecommunications and Information Technology (ECTI-CON)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7180538/7206924/07207016.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ECTICon.2015.7207016","startPage":"1","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7207016","abstract":"We consider a downlink distributed antenna system (DAS) in which transmit antennas are placed in a circular layout and each mobile user is equipped with a single receive antenna.

To solve this problem, this paper proposes a time domain equalization (TDE) technique in conjunction with a time domain channel impulse response (CIR) estimation method for the DFTS-OFDM signal. The salient features of proposed method are to employ a time domain training sequence (TS) in the estimation of CIR at every sampling time instead of using the conventional scattered pilots inserted in the frequency domain and to employ the TDE with a maximum likelihood (ML) estimation method in the demodulation of received time domain signal at every symbol instead of using the conventional frequency domain equalization (FDE) method. This paper presents various simulation results to demonstrate the effectiveness of proposed method for the DFTS-OFDM signal as comparing with the conventional FDE method.","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 12th International Conference on Electrical Engineering/Electronics, Computer, Telecommunications and Information Technology

The ease of communication at the user end and the growth of feature rich mobile systems over the years has added to the ever increasing demand of higher data rates in a communication system. MIMO-OFDM systems have been a breakthrough in achieving appreciable data rates while keeping the issues faced in communication systems at bay. Channel Equalization in MIMO-OFDM systems is an area that has been extensively researched upon with the passage of time, to boost the data rates for high speed communication. In this article, performance analysis of a Fast Recursive Least Squares (FRLS) based adaptive channel equalizer for MIMO-OFDM systems employed in signal transmission using Binary Phase Shift Keying (BPSK) modulation was done and compared with the much popular Zero-forcing equalizer (ZF) and Minimum Mean Square Error (MMSE) equalizer. A qualitative analysis of the robustness of channel equalizers in a MIMO-OFDM systems with two transmit and two receiving antennae, was carried out. Simulations over a wide range of SNRs was done and Bit Error Rate (BER) was determined.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7206924","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ECTICon.2015.7207038","publicationTitle":"2015 12th International Conference on Electrical Engineering/Electronics, Computer, Telecommunications and Information Technology (ECTI-CON)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 12th International Conference on Electrical Engineering/Electronics, Computer, Telecommunications and Information Technology (ECTI-CON)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7180538/7206924/07207038.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doi":"10.1109/ECTICon.2015.7207038","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance analysis of a fast recursive least squares channel equalizer for MIMO-OFDM systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-27 June 2015","displayDocTitle":"Performance analysis of a fast recursive least squares channel equalizer for MIMO-OFDM systems","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"24-27 June 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7207038/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15384272","dateOfInsertion":"20 August 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7207038/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance analysis of a fast recursive least squares channel equalizer for MIMO-OFDM systems","confLoc":"Hua Hin, Thailand","sourcePdf":"1194.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.040472S","chronDate":"24-27 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7180538","isNumber":"7206924","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7180538","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7206924","articleId":"7207038","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7207055,"authors":[{"name":"Manvendra Singh","affiliation":["Instruments Research and Development Establishment, Dehradun, India"],"firstName":"Manvendra","lastName":"Singh","id":"38201078600"},{"name":"Manoj Purohit","affiliation":["Instruments Research and Development Establishment, Dehradun, India"],"firstName":"Manoj","lastName":"Purohit","id":"37085448176"},{"name":"Sudhir Khare","affiliation":["Instruments Research and Development Establishment, Dehradun, India"],"firstName":"Sudhir","lastName":"Khare","id":"37085445832"},{"name":"Brajesh Kumar Kaushik","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Communication Engg, Indian Institute of Technology, Roorkee, India"],"firstName":"Brajesh Kumar","lastName":"Kaushik","id":"37394845100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-7961-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-7960-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7207055","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":193},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7207055","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Histograms","Field programmable gate arrays","Real-time systems","Hardware","Image enhancement","Algorithm design and analysis","Computer architecture"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["clutter","field programmable gate arrays","image enhancement","object detection","real-time systems","surveillance","target tracking"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FPGA based implementation","real-time image enhancement algorithms","electro-optical surveillance systems","target detection","target tracking","atmospheric degradation","background clutter","detection process","image quality","detection capability","operational scenario","reconfigurable architecture","naval platform","land platform","architectural design","image processing algorithms"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Electro-optics","FPGA","reconfigurable architecture","real-time image enhancement","surveillance systems"]}],"abstract":"Electro-Optical (EO) surveillance systems are capable of performing autonomous search, detection, tracking and designation of potential targets. The detection and tracking of target at long range is a challenge due to atmospheric degradation and background clutter. The detection process heavily depends on its image quality.

The performance of these techniques varies with operational scenario as the surveillance is a very subjective process by nature. Reconfigurable architecture based upon FPGA has been chosen to implement real-time image enhancement, for improved range performance (detection/recognition/identification) of EO systems considering the scenarios such as naval and land platforms.

Most important specification of a radar system is range resolution, which is strictly determined by the frequency bandwidth of transmitted signal. However, due to the legal regulation of radio wave emission, its frequency band is strictly limited. In the case that the maximum and minimum frequencies of the signal are fixed, the normal range resolution is same, but there is a severe problem of TOA ambiguity, when the effective bandwidth is considerably lower. To solve this problem, we introduce the compressed sensing (CS) approach. The results from numerical simulation show that our method can suppress the TOA ambiguity even that actual bandwidth of transmitted signal is quite narrower.","doi":"10.1109/ECTICon.2015.7207059","publicationTitle":"2015 12th International Conference on Electrical Engineering/Electronics, Computer, Telecommunications and Information Technology (ECTI-CON)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 12th International Conference on Electrical Engineering/Electronics, Computer, Telecommunications and Information Technology (ECTI-CON)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7180538/7206924/07207059.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ECTICon.2015.7207059","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7206924","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High-resolution time of arrival estimation method for synthetic band chirp-signals using compressed sensing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7207059","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-27 June 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7207059/","displayDocTitle":"High-resolution time of arrival estimation method for synthetic band chirp-signals using compressed sensing","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15384289","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7207059/","conferenceDate":"24-27 June 2015","dateOfInsertion":"20 August 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High-resolution time of arrival estimation method for synthetic band chirp-signals using compressed sensing","confLoc":"Hua Hin, Thailand","sourcePdf":"1220.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05483S","chronDate":"24-27 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7180538","isNumber":"7206924","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7180538","xplore-issue":"7206924","articleId":"7207059","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7207061,"authors":[{"name":"Kanyarat Ek-iam","affiliation":["Faculty of Engineering, Chiang Mai University, Chiang Mai, Thailand"],"firstName":"Kanyarat","lastName":"Ek-iam","id":"37085483924"},{"name":"Yuttana Kumsuwan","affiliation":["Faculty of Engineering, Chiang Mai University, Chiang Mai, Thailand"],"firstName":"Yuttana","lastName":"Kumsuwan","id":"37542173400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-7961-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-7960-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7207061","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":255},"abstract":"In this paper, a methodology to apply space vector modulation (SVM) to a three-level neutral point clamped (NPC) inverter based on volt-second balancing principle is presented.

It realizes pipeline operations by adjusting delay times. Implementation of fine-tuning of wave-pipelines is possible to further increase the throughput. However, in the FPGA, it is not able to be executed by the restriction on the structure. This paper proposes a fine-tuning method for the FPGA developed by the register-transfer level (RTL) design. Although the RTL design of the FPGA has various advantages, it is required for a high-speed design for a routing delay which is larger than that of a conventional FPGA. The method is timing adjustment using a connection block with the RTL design. Results of analysis of the connection block show that the seven stages of the delay adjustment are possible in the block. In addition, the block can be used for rough-tuning of delay times.

The problem can be formulated as a nonlinear optimization problem, which is numerically solved using sequential quadratic programming (SQP).

Most prioritization techniques concern with choosing test cases based on their ability to cover more faults. Other techniques aim to maximize code coverage. Thus, the test cases selected should secure the total coverage to assure the adequacy of software testing. In this paper, we present an algorithm to prioritize test cases based on total coverage using a modified genetic algorithm.

Hydrological prediction is important for the state flood control and drought relief. How to forecast accurately and timely with hydrological big data becomes a big challenge. There are some forecasting techniques used widely. However, they are limited by their adaptability, the data volume and the data feature. The most important problems are the high time consumption, low accuracy and bad adaptability of prediction. In this paper, a new forecasting approach based on an integration of two tasks of data mining is put forward. This approach which is called S LMDBP combines similarity search and Levenberg-Marquardt(LM) algorithm improved Double-hidden layer Back Propagation(BP) neural network. A specialized data pretreatment including three parts is applied to process the hydrological data. The results of similarity search are then input into the improved BP neural network, which not only reduces dimensionality of training data without losing important patterns, but also improves the accuracy of the prediction. A set of experiments are conducted to validate the proposed approach. The data in the experiment is the daily water level data of three stations in Jiangxi province of China from 1950 to 2010. The experimental results demonstrate the real-timing, accuracy and robustness of our approach.","doi":"10.1109/BigDataCongress.2015.58","startPage":"343","endPage":"350","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Congress on Big Data","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/BigDataCongress.2015.58","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7207183","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Congress on Big Data","pdfPath":"/iel7/7194705/7207183/07207242.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hydrological Big Data Prediction Based on Similarity Search and Improved BP Neural Network","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7207242/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Hydrological Big Data Prediction Based on Similarity Search and Improved BP Neural Network","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7207242/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"15411708","publicationDate":"June 2015","dateOfInsertion":"20 August 2015","conferenceDate":"27 June-2 July 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 27 2015-July 2 2015","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hydrological Big Data Prediction Based on Similarity Search and Improved BP Neural Network","confLoc":"New York, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"7278a343.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058341S","chronDate":"June 27 2015-July 2 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7194705","isNumber":"7207183","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7194705","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"7207183","articleId":"7207242","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":7207278,"authors":[{"name":"Vladimir Hahanov","affiliation":["Computer Engineering Faculty, National University of Radioelectronics, Kharkov, Ukraine"],"firstName":"Vladimir","lastName":"Hahanov","id":"37266995800"},{"name":"Wajeb Gharibi","affiliation":["Computer Science Department, Jazan University, Jazan, KSA"],"firstName":"Wajeb","lastName":"Gharibi","id":"37547697100"},{"name":"Eugenia Litvinova","affiliation":["Computer Engineering Faculty, National University of Radioelectronics, Kharkov, Ukraine"],"firstName":"Eugenia","lastName":"Litvinova","id":"37411735000"},{"name":"Svetlana Chumachenko","affiliation":["Computer Engineering Faculty, National University of Radioelectronics, Kharkov, Ukraine"],"firstName":"Svetlana","lastName":"Chumachenko","id":"37284934100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7278-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-7277-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2379-7703"}],"articleNumber":"7207278","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":17,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":331},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7207278","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Big data","Cyberspace","Process control","Measurement","Computers","Planets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Big Data","decision making","information retrieval","pattern classification","system-on-chip"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["vector-logical operations","information retrieval","nonnumerical quality criteria","semantic infrastructure","competence classification","cyber-ecosystem","virtual parallel multiprocessors","structural model","cloud-focused processors","parallel virtual computers","quantum primitives","qubit primitives","sequential element","combinational element","memory components","transactional interaction","computing automaton","qubit-vector model","cloud service-filters","cyber-physical systems","virtual parallel processors","multiprocessor digital systems-on-chips","arithmetic operation removal","vector-logical big data processing","logical xor-operation","cyberspace measurement","Boolean metric","decision-making","pattern recognition","big data driven cyber analytic system"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["big data","cyberspace analytics","cyber-physical system","cyber metric for information retrieval"]}],"abstract":"An infrastructure for parallel analyzing big data in order to search, pattern recognition and decision-making based on the use of the Boolean metric of cyberspace measurement is proposed.

However, the huge amount of data in an execution trace may complexify its analysis. Moreover, users are not usually interested in all events of a trace, hence the need for a proper filtering approach. Filtering is used to generate an enhanced trace, with a reduced size and complexity, that is easier to analyse. The approach described in this paper allows to define custom filtering patterns, declaratively in XML, to concentrate the analysis on the most important and interesting events. The filtering scenarios include syntaxes to describe various analysis patterns using finite state machines. The patterns range from very simple event filtering to complex multi-level event abstraction, covering various types of synthetic behaviours that can be captured from execution trace data. The paper provides the details on this data-driven filtering approach and some interesting use cases for the trace events generated by the LTTng Linux kernel tracer.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7207296/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 27 2015-July 2 2015","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"27 June-2 July 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7207296/","dateOfInsertion":"20 August 2015","publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15411650","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A Flexible Data-Driven Approach for Execution Trace Filtering","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Flexible Data-Driven Approach for Execution Trace Filtering","confLoc":"New York, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"7278a698.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060811S","chronDate":"June 27 2015-July 2 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7194705","isNumber":"7207183","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7194705","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"7207183","articleId":"7207296","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7207297,"authors":[{"name":"Weijia Xu","affiliation":["The University of Texas at Austin, Austin, Texas"],"firstName":"Weijia","lastName":"Xu","id":"37833781800"},{"name":"Wei Luo","affiliation":["Beijing Document Service, Beijing, P.

Large-scale experiments are conducted and experimental results are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed approach.","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Services Computing","pdfPath":"/iel7/7194374/7207317/07207340.pdf","startPage":"90","endPage":"97","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Services Computing","doi":"10.1109/SCC.2015.22","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SCC.2015.22","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7207317","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7207340","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Spectrum-Based Runtime Anomaly Localisation in Service-Based Systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Quality of service","Monitoring","Runtime","Time factors","Engines","Streaming media","Inspection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fault tolerant computing","program diagnostics","quality of service","service-oriented architecture","software quality"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["spectrum-based runtime anomaly localisation","service-based systems","SBS","user requests","component service monitoring","resource consumption","component service inspection","spectrum-based fault localisation technique","QoS violation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Service-Based System","Web Service","Quality of Service","Anomaly Localisation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7207340/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 27 2015-July 2 2015","displayDocTitle":"Spectrum-Based Runtime Anomaly Localisation in Service-Based Systems","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7207340/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15411621","dateOfInsertion":"20 August 2015","conferenceDate":"27 June-2 July 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spectrum-Based Runtime Anomaly Localisation in Service-Based Systems","confLoc":"New York, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"7281a090.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.205434S","chronDate":"June 27 2015-July 2 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7194374","isNumber":"7207317","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7194374","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7207317","articleId":"7207340","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7207354,"authors":[{"name":"Zhuobing Han","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Technology, Tianjin University, Tianjin, China"],"firstName":"Zhuobing","lastName":"Han","id":"37085480935"},{"name":"Xiaohong Li","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Technology, Tianjin University, Tianjin, China"],"firstName":"Xiaohong","lastName":"Li","id":"37539488900"},{"name":"Eleni Stroulia","affiliation":["Department of Computing Science, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Canada"],"firstName":"Eleni","lastName":"Stroulia","id":"37265166000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7281-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-7280-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7207354","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":269},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Servers","Software as a service","Access control","Data security"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["auditing","cloud computing","security of data"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Microsoft Azure cloud","Google cloud","security score","SaaS layers","PaaS","IaaS","cloud-computing services","cloud-resource providers","hierarchical security-auditing methodology"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cloud Computing","Analytic Hierarchical Process (AHP)","Multi-level Fuzzy Comprehensive Evaluation (MFCE)","security evaluation"]}],"abstract":"Security concerns are frequently mentioned among the reasons why organizations hesitate to adopt cloud computing.

In particular, the availability of data at hitherto unimagined scales and temporal longitudes coupled with a new generation of intelligent processing algorithms can: (a) facilitate an evolution in the practice of medicine, from the current post facto diagnose-and-treat reactive paradigm, to a proactive framework for prognosis of diseases at an incipient stage, coupled with prevention, cure, and overall management of health instead of disease, (b) enable personalization of treatment and management options targeted particularly to the specific circumstances and needs of the individual, and (c) help reduce the cost of health care while simultaneously improving outcomes.

This paper proposed an artificial neural network (ANN) based service rating scheme that counters the manipulation of service ratings. The scheme takes into account of both similarity-based rating and the ratings given by representative users when predicting a user's rating to a service. Some experiments were carried out to compare the prediction accuracy of the proposed scheme with a well-known existing scheme WSRec [26].

However, complexity and cost factors have forced us to outsource the VLSI design phases across the globe. Such sites may not be trusted and threat lies in the introduction of malicious intrusions at any stage of the design flow. Such malicious intrusions, also known as Hardware Trojan Horses (HTH) remain dormant during the testing phase but get triggered at runtime and threaten the integrity and confidentiality of the chip. In this paper, we focus on threat to confidentiality. HTH threatens the confidentiality of such chips by leaking the secret information at runtime. We propose an intelligent architecture, Runtime Trust Neural Architecture (RTNA) based on Adaptive Resonance Theory (ART 1) neural network, which when incorporated with the SOC architecture can prevent it at runtime from being compromised confidentially. Low area and low power overhead of our proposed RTNA on practical crypto SOC architectures as obtained in the experimental results confirm its practical implementation. Hardware implementation of trust generation at runtime, use of unsupervised learning and use of an intelligent architecture are the novelties of this work.","doi":"10.1109/ISVDAT.2015.7208048","pdfPath":"/iel7/7166536/7208044/07208048.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 19th International Symposium on VLSI Design and Test","publicationTitle":"2015 19th International Symposium on VLSI Design and Test","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISVDAT.2015.7208048","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7208044","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"RTNA: Securing SOC architectures from confidentiality attacks at runtime using ART1 neural networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7208048/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 June 2015","displayDocTitle":"RTNA: Securing SOC architectures from confidentiality attacks at runtime using ART1 neural networks","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"20 August 2015","accessionNumber":"15383653","publicationDate":"June 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7208048/","conferenceDate":"26-29 June 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"RTNA: Securing SOC architectures from confidentiality attacks at runtime using ART1 neural networks","confLoc":"Ahmedabad, India","sourcePdf":"109paper3693427.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073532S","chronDate":"26-29 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7166536","isNumber":"7208044","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7166536","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"7208044","articleId":"7208048","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":7208057,"authors":[{"name":"Mudasir Bashir","affiliation":["Department of ECE NIT, Warangal, India"],"firstName":"Mudasir","lastName":"Bashir","id":"37085639110"},{"name":"Sreehari Rao Patri","affiliation":["Department of ECE NIT, Warangal, India"],"firstName":"Sreehari Rao","lastName":"Patri","id":"38189547600"},{"name":"K S R Krishnaprasad","affiliation":["Nalanda Institute of Technology, Bhubaneswar, Orissa, IN"],"firstName":"K S R","lastName":"Krishnaprasad"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-1743-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-1742-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7208057","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":920},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Delays","Power dissipation","Capacitance","Sensors","Transistors","Random access memory","CMOS integrated circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["amplifiers","capacitance","CMOS memory circuits","SRAM chips"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["high speed self biased current sense amplifier","low power CMOS SRAM","CMOS memories","access time","power dissipation","memory cells","high speed CMOS technologies","conveyer based current-mode sense amplifiers","bit-line capacitances","sense delay"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["SRAM cell","Sense Amplifiers","Sense Delay","Current Conveyer","Bitline capacitance"]}],"abstract":"Sense amplifiers are one of the important circuits in the CMOS memories as they have a greater impact on the access time and power dissipation of memory cells.

The reduction of power supply, for reduced power dissipation, is carried out in this paper. In this paper, DRV of a 6T, 8T and 10T SRAM was measured using Cadence tools at 45nm technology. The DRV of 6T SRAM cell simulated is compared with the DRV estimated from the analytical model. A close simulated value comes out approximately equal to the DRV estimated from the model. Then the variations of temperature and device sizing were studied with different supply voltages.

Globalization raises the question of trust in an integrated circuit. It is for the every chip maker to ensure there is no malicious inclusion in the design, which is referred as Hardware Trojans. Malicious inclusion can occur by an in-house adversary design engineer, Intellectual Property (IP) core supplied from the third party vendor or at untrusted manufacturing foundry. Several researchers have proposed hardware Trojan detection schemes in the recent years. Trust-Hub provides Trojan benchmark circuits to verify the strength of the Trojan detection techniques. In this work, our focus is on Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) Trojan benchmarks, which is most vulnerable block cipher for Trojan attacks. All 21 Benchmarks available in Trusthub are analyzed against standard coverage driven verification practices, synthesis, DFT insertion and ATPG simulations. The analysis reveals that 19 AES benchmarks are weak and Trojan inclusion can be detected using standard procedures used in ASIC design flow. Based on the weakness observed design modification is proposed to improve the quality of Trojan benchmarks. The strength of proposed Trojan benchmarks is better than existing circuits and their original features are also preserved after design modification.","doi":"10.1109/ISVDAT.2015.7208064","publicationTitle":"2015 19th International Symposium on VLSI Design and Test","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 19th International Symposium on VLSI Design and Test","pdfPath":"/iel7/7166536/7208044/07208064.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISVDAT.2015.7208064","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7208044","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An improved AES Hardware Trojan benchmark to validate Trojan detection schemes in an ASIC design flow","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7208064","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 June 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7208064/","displayDocTitle":"An improved AES Hardware Trojan benchmark to validate Trojan detection schemes in an ASIC design flow","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15383569","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7208064/","conferenceDate":"26-29 June 2015","dateOfInsertion":"20 August 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An improved AES Hardware Trojan benchmark to validate Trojan detection schemes in an ASIC design flow","confLoc":"Ahmedabad, India","sourcePdf":"150paper3794979.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.127723S","chronDate":"26-29 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7166536","isNumber":"7208044","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7166536","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"7208044","articleId":"7208064","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7208082,"authors":[{"name":"Praneet Bhatia","affiliation":["BITS Pilani K.K.

Due to its self correcting capability, the design is called a Self Correcting Sense Amplifier (SCSA). Analysis carried out on Current Latch Sense Amplifier (CLSA) and SCSA showed 2.3\u00d7 offset tolerance in SCSA when compared to CLSA at high-density SRAM conditions (500fF bit-line capacitance). SCSA also consumed 9% less dynamic power and offers 13% less sensing delay in offset condition. This resulted in a 27% reduction in power delay product. It thus offers a much better read-effectiveness and robustness against device mismatch and bit-line capacitances as well as V\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">DD</sub>\n variation.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7208044","publicationTitle":"2015 19th International Symposium on VLSI Design and Test","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 19th International Symposium on VLSI Design and Test","pdfPath":"/iel7/7166536/7208044/07208082.pdf","doi":"10.1109/ISVDAT.2015.7208082","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISVDAT.2015.7208082","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An offset-tolerant self-correcting sense amplifier for robust high speed SRAM","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 June 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7208082/","displayDocTitle":"An offset-tolerant self-correcting sense amplifier for robust high speed SRAM","htmlLink":"/document/7208082/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"26-29 June 2015","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"15383573","dateOfInsertion":"20 August 2015","publicationDate":"June 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An offset-tolerant self-correcting sense amplifier for robust high speed SRAM","confLoc":"Ahmedabad, India","sourcePdf":"200paper3682053.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.085745S","chronDate":"26-29 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7166536","isNumber":"7208044","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7166536","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"7208044","articleId":"7208082","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7208087,"authors":[{"name":"Kshitij Agrawal","affiliation":["IIIT-Hyderabad, Centre for VLSI and Embedded Systems Technology"],"firstName":"Kshitij","lastName":"Agrawal","id":"37085708523"},{"name":"Shubhajit Roy Chowdhury","affiliation":["IIIT-Hyderabad, Centre for VLSI and Embedded Systems Technology"],"firstName":"Shubhajit Roy","lastName":"Chowdhury","id":"37849582400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-1743-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-1742-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7208087","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":182},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Real time multisensor Laplacian fusion on FPGA","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 19th International Symposium on VLSI Design and Test","pdfPath":"/iel7/7166536/7208044/07208087.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","publicationTitle":"2015 19th International Symposium on VLSI Design and Test","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISVDAT.2015.7208087","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7208044","doi":"10.1109/ISVDAT.2015.7208087","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Laplace equations","Image fusion","Field programmable gate arrays","Real-time systems","Graphics processing units","Band-pass filters","Hardware"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","image fusion","sensor fusion"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["real time multisensor Laplacian fusion","FPGA","composite image","Laplacian pyramid image fusion","field programmable gate array","real time image fusion","pyramid decomposition","re-usable memory architecture","parallelisation technique","GPU"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["fpga","laplacian fusion","image fusion"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7208087","abstract":"Image fusion is a technique to combine multiple images from a single sensor or multiple sensors into a single composite image without introducing artifacts.

So, Next generation RF (Radio Frequency) Frontend requires wideband with multiple standards support. RF Frontend relaxes tough requirements (dynamic range, speed, noise performance and linearity) of Baseband A/D converter. An LNA (Low Noise Amplifier) of RF Frontend relaxes the noise performance and dynamic range requirements by amplifying weak received signal with adding minimum noise to improve signal to noise ratio. This paper presents a novel hybrid topology low-noise amplifier (LNA) design for wideband receivers and microwave access covering the frequency range from 1 to 7 GHz using 0.18-\u03bcm CMOS. Simulation results shows that the power gain reaches a peak of 30 dB in-band with an upper 3dB frequency of 7 GHz with minimum noise figure (NF) 4dB over the band of interest.

A figure of merit is used to compare the proposed design with recently published wideband CMOS LNAs. It shows that the design of LNA achieves comparable good performances.

This paper proposes a two phase heuristic technique for routing droplets on a two-dimensional DMFB. Initially it attempts to route maximum number of nets in a concurrent fashion depending on the evaluated value of a proposed function named Interfering Index (II\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">net</sub>\n). Next the remaining nets having interfering index values higher than threshold will be routed considering various constraints in DMFB framework. Our method will check all the conflict arises between various routing paths from same assay or from different assays and also with the unsuccessful routing paths from the first phase (if any). If conflict occurs it determines the conflict zone on the chip as Critical Region(CR). Another metric named Routable Ratio (RR) is proposed and depending on RR metric, our method prioritized the routing order among conflicting paths(nets) to avoid deadlock from there onwards till the droplet reaches its target location. Experimental results on Benchmark suites III show our proposed technique reduces latest arrival time upto certain extent but significantly reduces average assay execution time and number of used cell compared to earlier routing methods for DMFB.","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 19th International Symposium on VLSI Design and Test","pdfPath":"/iel7/7166536/7208044/07208144.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","publicationTitle":"2015 19th International Symposium on VLSI Design and Test","doi":"10.1109/ISVDAT.2015.7208144","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISVDAT.2015.7208144","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7208044","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7208144","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A novel two phase heuristic routing technique in digital microfluidic biochip","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Routing","Indexes","Contamination","Electrodes","Electronic mail","Timing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biological techniques","lab-on-a-chip","microfluidics","minimisation","network routing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["target location","RR metric","routable ratio","critical region","IInet","interfering index","routing droplets","cross-contamination minimization","2D DMFB","digital microfluidic biochip","heuristic routing technique"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Biochips","Digital Microfluidics","Physical design","Droplet routing","Cross-contamination"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7208144/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 June 2015","displayDocTitle":"A novel two phase heuristic routing technique in digital microfluidic biochip","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7208144/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15399530","dateOfInsertion":"20 August 2015","conferenceDate":"26-29 June 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A novel two phase heuristic routing technique in digital microfluidic biochip","confLoc":"Ahmedabad, India","sourcePdf":"74paper3792561.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.090262S","chronDate":"26-29 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7166536","isNumber":"7208044","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7166536","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7208044","articleId":"7208144","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7208148,"authors":[{"name":"Arpita Dutta","affiliation":["Dept. of Electronics and Electrical Communication, Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur, India"],"firstName":"Arpita","lastName":"Dutta","id":"37085709638"},{"name":"Santanu Chattopadhyay","affiliation":["Dept. of Electronics and Electrical Communication, Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur, India"],"firstName":"Santanu","lastName":"Chattopadhyay","id":"37277128800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-1743-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-1742-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7208148","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":81},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Built-in self-test","Logic gates","Flip-flops","Power demand","Circuit faults","Polynomials"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["benchmark testing","built-in self test","cooling","logic testing","particle swarm optimisation","power consumption"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["particle swarm optimization","BIST","heat generation","power consumption","heat dissipation","ISCAS'89","ITC'99","benchmark circuits"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["HotSpot","LT-RTPG","Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)","Thermal-aware test"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7208148","abstract":"Temperature of a block (a region in the chip) depends on both heat generation (caused by power consumption) and heat dissipation among neighbors.

So, it is not required to produce exact numerical outputs. Considering the advantage of relaxation in numerical accuracy, this paper propose several approximate multipliers for error tolerant applications which are designed by using approximate adders. Approximate adder is constructed by reducing the complexity at the transistor level. The power consumption is reduced due to decrease in number of transistors and switched capacitance. Decrease in the number of series connected transistors, lead to shorter critical paths. Propagation delay is appreciably reduced due to decrease in load capacitance. The operation of 4\u00d74, 8\u00d78 and 16\u00d716 approximate array multipliers are discussed in this paper.

The experiments prove that the pervasive mobile robot endowed with these additional voice signals analyzing abilities displays more intelligence and cooperativeness in its environment significantly improving human-robot multimodal communication.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fractional Fourier transform: A novel tool for multimodal communication improvement of pervasive mobile robots","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 10th Jubilee International Symposium on Applied Computational Intelligence and Informatics","doi":"10.1109/SACI.2015.7208190","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 10th Jubilee International Symposium on Applied Computational Intelligence and Informatics","pdfPath":"/iel7/7165000/7208165/07208190.pdf","startPage":"153","endPage":"160","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SACI.2015.7208190","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7208165","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7208190","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7208190/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-23 May 2015","displayDocTitle":"Fractional Fourier transform: A novel tool for multimodal communication improvement of pervasive mobile robots","conferenceDate":"21-23 May 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7208190/","dateOfInsertion":"20 August 2015","publicationDate":"May 2015","accessionNumber":"15383514","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fractional Fourier transform: A novel tool for multimodal communication improvement of pervasive mobile robots","confLoc":"Timisoara, Romania","sourcePdf":"30saci2015.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054762S","chronDate":"21-23 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7165000","isNumber":"7208165","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7165000","xplore-issue":"7208165","articleId":"7208190","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7208210,"authors":[{"name":"Claudia Farago","affiliation":["Department of Bases of Electronics, Technical University of Cluj-Napoca, Cluj-Napoca, Romania"],"firstName":"Claudia","lastName":"Farago","id":"37085621837"},{"name":"Gabriel Oltean","affiliation":["Department of Bases of Electronics, Technical University of Cluj-Napoca, Cluj-Napoca, Romania"],"firstName":"Gabriel","lastName":"Oltean","id":"37330501000"},{"name":"Paul Farago","affiliation":["Department of Bases of Electronics, Technical University of Cluj-Napoca, Cluj-Napoca, Romania"],"firstName":"Paul","lastName":"Farago","id":"37889149100"},{"name":"Sorin Hintea","affiliation":["Department of Bases of Electronics, Technical University of Cluj-Napoca, Cluj-Napoca, Romania"],"firstName":"Sorin","lastName":"Hintea","id":"37375447200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-9911-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7208210","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":88},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7208210","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optimization","Genetic algorithms","Transistors","Artificial neural networks","Sociology","Statistics","Yield estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electronic design automation","genetic algorithms","high level synthesis","integrated circuit design","neural nets","operational amplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["evolutionary approach","yield enhancement","analog amplifier","microelectronic industry","digital design","analog domain","high-level synthesis","automatic analog design","computational intelligence technique","evolutionary design methodology","transistor-level design automation","design automation workflow","artificial neural network","genetic algorithm","folded-cascode operational transconductance amplifier"]}],"abstract":"The microelectronic industry is driven by the continuous demand for processing speed and capacity. To answer such demands, novel design paradigms target design automation. While digital design is mostly automatic, design automation in the analog domain is limited and mainly used for high-level synthesis. A promising solution to overcome limitations and constrains of automatic analog design is to involve computational intelligence techniques. This work proposes an evolutionary design methodology to bring contributions to transistor-level design automation. The proposed framework is built around a typical design automation workflow: Feasibility design, Nominal design and Design centering. The Feasibility design layer employs an artificial neural network to generate an initial solution. The following two layers employ genetic algorithms to optimize the amplifier for performance and yield respectively. The proposed design methodology is illustrated on the design of a folded-cascode operational transconductance amplifier and is validated by the results of extensive simulation.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7208165","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SACI.2015.7208210","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 10th Jubilee International Symposium on Applied Computational Intelligence and Informatics","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 10th Jubilee International Symposium on Applied Computational Intelligence and Informatics","pdfPath":"/iel7/7165000/7208165/07208210.pdf","startPage":"265","endPage":"270","doi":"10.1109/SACI.2015.7208210","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An evolutionary approach for Nominal design and yield enhancement of analog amplifiers","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-23 May 2015","displayDocTitle":"An evolutionary approach for Nominal design and yield enhancement of analog amplifiers","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"21-23 May 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7208210/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2015","accessionNumber":"15383534","dateOfInsertion":"20 August 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7208210/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An evolutionary approach for Nominal design and yield enhancement of analog amplifiers","confLoc":"Timisoara, Romania","sourcePdf":"49saci2015.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049072S","chronDate":"21-23 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7165000","isNumber":"7208165","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7165000","xplore-issue":"7208165","articleId":"7208210","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7208215,"authors":[{"name":"Ovidiu Sicoe","affiliation":["Computer Engineering Department, University Politehnica of Timisoara, Timisoara, Romania"],"firstName":"Ovidiu","lastName":"Sicoe","id":"37076279000"},{"name":"Alexandru Amaricai","affiliation":["Computer Engineering Department, University Politehnica of Timisoara, Timisoara, Romania"],"firstName":"Alexandru","lastName":"Amaricai","id":"37396351700"},{"name":"Mircea Popa","affiliation":["Computer Engineering Department, University Politehnica of Timisoara, Timisoara, Romania"],"firstName":"Mircea","lastName":"Popa","id":"37284130400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-9911-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7208215","dbTime":"18 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":58},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Generation of floating point 2D translation operators for FPGA","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7208215","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Computer architecture","Field programmable gate arrays","Pipelines","Clocks","Parallel processing","Mathematical model","Multiplexing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","floating point arithmetic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["floating point 2D translation operators","FPGA implementation","matrix operator","geometric two dimensional translation","translation matrix","null elements","functional units"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["FPGA","affine geometric transformation","floating-point","translation unit"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents an FPGA implementation of a matrix operator for geometric two dimensional translation.

More exactly, on which server the data is processed, how it is manipulated and stored at the physical or virtual level. To have a full picture of what it is going on we need to have a centralized system that can collect data regarding about the datacenters status and correlate them with known anomalies and other usage patterns and in case of a security breach to act accordingly. In this paper we present a new way to monitor running virtual machines existing at a datacenter level.

However, the volatile nature of DRAM makes these systems vulnerable to system crashes, while the need to continuously refresh massive amounts of passive memoryresident data increases power consumption. Emerging storage-class memory (SCM) technologies combine fast DRAM-like cache-line access granularity with the persistence of storage devices like disks or SSDs, resulting in potential 10x-100x performance gains, and low passive power consumption. This unification of storage and memory into a single directly-accessible persistent tier raises significant reliability and pro-grammability challenges. In this paper, we present SoftWrAP, an open-source framework for Software based Write-Aside Persistence. SoftWrAP provides lightweight atomicity and durability for SCM storage transactions, while ensuring fast paths to data in processor caches, DRAM, and persistent memory tiers. We use our framework to evaluate both handcrafted SCM-based microbenchmarks as well as existing applications, specifically the STX B+Tree library and SQLite database, backed by emulated SCM. Our results show significant benefits of SoftWrAP over existing methods such as undo logging and shadow copying, and can match non-atomic durable writes to SCM, thereby gaining atomic consistency almost for free.","doi":"10.1109/MSST.2015.7208276","publicationTitle":"2015 31st Symposium on Mass Storage Systems and Technologies (MSST)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 31st Symposium on Mass Storage Systems and Technologies (MSST)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7167175/7208272/07208276.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"14","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MSST.2015.7208276","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7208272","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"SoftWrAP: A lightweight framework for transactional support of storage class memory","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"SoftWrAP: A lightweight framework for transactional support of storage class memory","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"20 August 2015","accessionNumber":"15383682","publicationDate":"May 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7208276/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7208276/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 30 2015-June 5 2015","conferenceDate":"30 May-5 June 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"SoftWrAP: A lightweight framework for transactional support of storage class memory","confLoc":"Santa Clara, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"035Giles.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068354S","chronDate":"May 30 2015-June 5 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7167175","isNumber":"7208272","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7167175","citationCount":"33","xplore-issue":"7208272","articleId":"7208276","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":7208277,"authors":[{"name":"Wei Wang","affiliation":["Computational Science Research Center San Diego State University, San Diego, CA"],"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Wang","id":"37072502900"},{"name":"Tao Xie","affiliation":["Computer Science Department San Diego State University, San Diego, CA"],"firstName":"Tao","lastName":"Xie","id":"37286916100"},{"name":"Antoine Khoueir","affiliation":["Seagate Technology, Shakopee, MN"],"firstName":"Antoine","lastName":"Khoueir","id":"37085402823"},{"name":"Youngpil Kim","affiliation":["Seagate Technology, Shakopee, MN"],"firstName":"Youngpil","lastName":"Kim","id":"37085413758"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7619-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2160-195X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2160-1968"}],"articleNumber":"7208277","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":257},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reducing MLC flash memory retention errors through Programming Initial Step Only","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 31st Symposium on Mass Storage Systems and Technologies (MSST)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7167175/7208272/07208277.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","publicationTitle":"2015 31st Symposium on Mass Storage Systems and Technologies (MSST)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MSST.2015.7208277","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7208272","doi":"10.1109/MSST.2015.7208277","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Programming","Threshold voltage","Ash","Logic gates","Memory management","Reliability","Error correction codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["flash memories"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MLC flash memory retention errors","programming initial step only","multilevel cell flash","PISO operation","programming-and-verifying step","charge loss"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7208277","abstract":"Retention error has been recognized as the most dominant error in MLC (multi-level cell) flash. In this paper, we propose a new approach called PISO (Programming Initial Step Only) to reduce its number. Unlike a normal programming operation, a PISO operation only carries out the first programming-and-verifying step on a programmed cell. As a result, a number of electrons are injected into the cell to compensate its charge loss over time without disturbing its existing data. Further, we build a model to understand the relationship between the number of PISOs and the number of reduced errors. Experimental results from 1y-nm MLC chips show that PISO can efficiently reduce the number of retention errors with a minimal overhead. On average, applying 10 PISO operations each month on a one-year-old MLC chip that has experienced 4K P/E cycles can reduce its retention errors by 21.5% after 3 months.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7208277/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 30 2015-June 5 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"May 2015","accessionNumber":"15383687","htmlLink":"/document/7208277/","dateOfInsertion":"20 August 2015","conferenceDate":"30 May-5 June 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Reducing MLC flash memory retention errors through Programming Initial Step Only","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reducing MLC flash memory retention errors through Programming Initial Step Only","confLoc":"Santa Clara, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"043Wang.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072632S","chronDate":"May 30 2015-June 5 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7167175","isNumber":"7208272","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7167175","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"7208272","articleId":"7208277","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7208278,"authors":[{"name":"Fabio Margaglia","affiliation":["Johannes Gutenberg-Universit\u00e4t, Mainz, Germany"],"firstName":"Fabio","lastName":"Margaglia","id":"37085482803"},{"name":"Andre Brinkmann","affiliation":["Johannes Gutenberg-Universit\u00e4t, Mainz, Germany"],"firstName":"Andre","lastName":"Brinkmann","id":"37299903000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7619-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2160-195X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2160-1968"}],"articleNumber":"7208278","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":435},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Ash","Programming","Error correction codes","Seals","Boards","Logic gates","Prototypes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["flash memories"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MLC flash performance","MLC flash endurance","program-erase cycle","NAND flash memory","flash cells physical structure","erase operations","extended P/E cycle","multilevel cell","OpenSSD prototyping board","greedy garbage collection strategy"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7208278","abstract":"The traditional usage pattern for NAND flash memory is the program/erase (P/E) cycle: the flash pages that make a flash block are all programmed in order and then the whole flash block needs to be erased before the pages can be programmed again. The erase operations are slow, wear out the medium, and require costly garbage collection procedures. Reducing their number is therefore beneficial both in terms of performance and endurance. The physical structure of flash cells limits the number of opportunities to overcome the 1 to 1 ratio between programming and erasing pages: a bit storing a logical 0 cannot be reprogrammed to a logical 1 before the end of the P/E cycle. This paper presents a technique to minimize the number of erase operations called extended P/E cycle. With extended P/E cycles, the flash pages can be programmed many times before the whole flash block needs to be erased, reducing the number of erase operations. We study the applicability of the technique to Multi Level Cell (MLC) NAND flash chips, and present a design and implementation on the OpenSSD prototyping board. The evaluation of our prototype shows that this technique can achieve erase operations reduction as high as 85%, with latency speedups of up to 67%, with respect to a FTL with traditional P/E cycles, and naive greedy garbage collection strategy. Our evaluation leads to valuable insights on how extended P/E cycles can be exploited by future applications.","doi":"10.1109/MSST.2015.7208278","publicationTitle":"2015 31st Symposium on Mass Storage Systems and Technologies (MSST)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 31st Symposium on Mass Storage Systems and Technologies (MSST)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7167175/7208272/07208278.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"12","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7208272","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MSST.2015.7208278","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improving MLC flash performance and endurance with extended P/E cycles","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7208278/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 30 2015-June 5 2015","displayDocTitle":"Improving MLC flash performance and endurance with extended P/E cycles","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7208278/","dateOfInsertion":"20 August 2015","publicationDate":"May 2015","accessionNumber":"15383696","conferenceDate":"30 May-5 June 2015","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improving MLC flash performance and endurance with extended P/E cycles","confLoc":"Santa Clara, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"0555Margaglia.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.074966S","chronDate":"May 30 2015-June 5 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7167175","isNumber":"7208272","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7167175","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"7208272","articleId":"7208278","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7208279,"authors":[{"name":"Heejin Park","affiliation":["University of Seoul"],"firstName":"Heejin","lastName":"Park","id":"37085340830"},{"name":"Jaeho Kim","affiliation":["Hongik University"],"firstName":"Jaeho","lastName":"Kim","id":"37073215100"},{"name":"Jongmoo Choi","affiliation":["Dankook University"],"firstName":"Jongmoo","lastName":"Choi","id":"38184321500"},{"name":"Donghee Lee","affiliation":["University of Seoul"],"firstName":"Donghee","lastName":"Lee","id":"37292975900"},{"name":"Sam H.

However, these chips have lower data retention period and endurance than SLC chips. With the reduced data retention period and endurance level, retention errors occur more frequently. One solution for these retention errors is to employ strong ECC to increase error correction strength. However, employing strong ECC may result in waste of resources during the early stages of flash memory lifetime as it has high reliability and data retention errors are rare during this period. The other solution is to employ data scrubbing that periodically refreshes data by reading and then writing the data to new locations after correcting errors through ECC. Though it is a viable solution for the retention error problem, data scrubbing hurts performance and lifetime of SSDs as it incurs extra read and write requests. Targeting data retention errors, we propose incremental redundancy (IR) that incrementally reinforces error correction capabilities when the data retention error rate exceeds a certain threshold. This extends the time before data scrubbing should occur, providing a grace period in which the block may be garbage collected. We develop mathematical analyses that project the lifetime and performance of IR as well as when using conventional data scrubbing. Through mathematical analyses and experiments with both synthetic and real workloads, we compare the lifetime and performance of the two schemes. Results suggest that IR can be a promising solution to overcome data retention errors of contemporary multi-bit cell flash memory. In particular, our study shows that IR can extend the maximum data retention period by 5 to 10 times. Additionally, we show that IR can reduce the write amplification factor by half under real workloads.","doi":"10.1109/MSST.2015.7208279","publicationTitle":"2015 31st Symposium on Mass Storage Systems and Technologies (MSST)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 31st Symposium on Mass Storage Systems and Technologies (MSST)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7167175/7208272/07208279.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MSST.2015.7208279","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7208272","startPage":"1","endPage":"13","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Incremental redundancy to reduce data retention errors in flash-based SSDs","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7208279","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Incremental redundancy to reduce data retention errors in flash-based SSDs","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 30 2015-June 5 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7208279/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"30 May-5 June 2015","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2015","accessionNumber":"15383693","dateOfInsertion":"20 August 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7208279/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Incremental redundancy to reduce data retention errors in flash-based SSDs","confLoc":"Santa Clara, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"0612Park.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.091503S","chronDate":"May 30 2015-June 5 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7167175","isNumber":"7208272","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7167175","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"7208272","articleId":"7208279","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7208284,"authors":[{"name":"Yixin Luo","affiliation":["Carnegie Mellon University"],"firstName":"Yixin","lastName":"Luo","id":"37085340873"},{"name":"Yu Cai","affiliation":["Carnegie Mellon University"],"firstName":"Yu","lastName":"Cai","id":"38064360900"},{"name":"Saugata Ghose","affiliation":["Carnegie Mellon University"],"firstName":"Saugata","lastName":"Ghose","id":"37085354352"},{"name":"Jongmoo Choi","affiliation":["Dankook University"],"firstName":"Jongmoo","lastName":"Choi","id":"38184321500"},{"name":"Onur Mutlu","affiliation":["Carnegie Mellon University"],"firstName":"Onur","lastName":"Mutlu","id":"37265510200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7619-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2160-195X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2160-1968"}],"articleNumber":"7208284","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":52,"citationCountPatent":3,"totalDownloads":1202},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Ash","Performance evaluation","Memory management","Time-frequency analysis","Reliability","Error correction codes","Resource management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data integrity","flash memories","NAND circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["WARM","NAND flash memory lifetime","write-hotness aware retention management","NAND flash memory density","internal data retention time relaxation","flash device data integrity property","I/O workload traces","adaptive refresh mechanism"]}],"abstract":"Increased NAND flash memory density has come at the cost of lifetime reductions. Flash lifetime can be extended by relaxing internal data retention time, the duration for which a flash cell correctly holds data. Such relaxation cannot be exposed externally to avoid altering the expected data integrity property of a flash device. Reliability mechanisms, most prominently refresh, restore the duration of data integrity, but greatly reduce the lifetime improvements from retention time relaxation by performing a large number of write operations. We find that retention time relaxation can be achieved more efficiently by exploiting heterogeneity in write-hotness, i.e., the frequency at which each page is written. We propose WARM, a write-hotness aware retention management policy for flash memory, which identifies and physically groups together write-hot data within the flash device, allowing the flash controller to selectively perform retention time relaxation with little cost. When applied alone, WARM improves overall flash lifetime by an average of 3.24\u00d7 over a conventional management policy without refresh, across a variety of real I/O workload traces. When WARM is applied together with an adaptive refresh mechanism, the average lifetime improves by 12.9\u00d7, 1.21\u00d7 over adaptive refresh alone.","doi":"10.1109/MSST.2015.7208284","publicationTitle":"2015 31st Symposium on Mass Storage Systems and Technologies (MSST)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 31st Symposium on Mass Storage Systems and Technologies (MSST)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7167175/7208272/07208284.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"14","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7208272","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MSST.2015.7208284","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"WARM: Improving NAND flash memory lifetime with write-hotness aware retention management","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7208284","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 30 2015-June 5 2015","displayDocTitle":"WARM: Improving NAND flash memory lifetime with write-hotness aware retention management","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7208284/","publicationDate":"May 2015","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"20 August 2015","accessionNumber":"15383695","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7208284/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"30 May-5 June 2015","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"WARM: Improving NAND flash memory lifetime with write-hotness aware retention management","confLoc":"Santa Clara, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"1111Luo.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.128973S","chronDate":"May 30 2015-June 5 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7167175","isNumber":"7208272","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7167175","citationCount":"52","xplore-issue":"7208272","articleId":"7208284","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7208291,"authors":[{"name":"Dongwoo Kang","affiliation":["Dept. of Software, Dankook University, South Korea"],"firstName":"Dongwoo","lastName":"Kang","id":"37085449275"},{"name":"Seungjae Baek","affiliation":["Dept. of Software, Dankook University, South Korea"],"firstName":"Seungjae","lastName":"Baek","id":"37288905200"},{"name":"Jongmoo Choi","affiliation":["Dept. of Software, Dankook University, South Korea"],"firstName":"Jongmoo","lastName":"Choi","id":"38184321500"},{"name":"Donghee Lee","affiliation":["School of Computer Science, University of Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Donghee","lastName":"Lee","id":"37292975900"},{"name":"Sam H.

To handle this issue, previous studies have focused on refreshing or advanced error correction code (ECC). In this paper, we take a different approach that makes use of the limited retention capability to our advantage. Specifically, we employ NVM as a file cache and devise a new scheme called amnesic cache management (ACM). The scheme is motivated by our observation that most data in a cache are evicted within a short time period after they have been entered into the cache, implying that they can be written with the relaxed retention capability. This retention relaxation can enhance the overall cache performance in terms of latency and energy since the data retention capability is proportional to the write latency. In addition, to prevent the retention relaxation from degrading the hit ratio, we estimate the future reference intervals based on the inter-reference gap (IRG) model and manage data adaptively. Experimental results with real-world workloads show that our scheme can reduce write latency by up to 40% (30% on average) and save energy consumption by up to 49% (37% on average) compared with the conventional LRU based cache management scheme.","doi":"10.1109/MSST.2015.7208291","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 31st Symposium on Mass Storage Systems and Technologies (MSST)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7167175/7208272/07208291.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7208272","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MSST.2015.7208291","publicationTitle":"2015 31st Symposium on Mass Storage Systems and Technologies (MSST)","startPage":"1","endPage":"13","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Amnesic cache management for non-volatile memory","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7208291","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 30 2015-June 5 2015","displayDocTitle":"Amnesic cache management for non-volatile memory","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7208291/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7208291/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2015","accessionNumber":"15383697","dateOfInsertion":"20 August 2015","conferenceDate":"30 May-5 June 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Amnesic cache management for non-volatile memory","confLoc":"Santa Clara, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"1848Kang.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.108984S","chronDate":"May 30 2015-June 5 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7167175","isNumber":"7208272","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7167175","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"7208272","articleId":"7208291","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7208348,"authors":[{"name":"G\u00fcrcan Lokman","affiliation":["Vocational School of Gerze, Sinop University, Sinop, Turkey"],"firstName":"G\u00fcrcan","lastName":"Lokman","id":"37085570639"},{"name":"G\u00fcray Y\u0131lmaz","affiliation":["Department of Computer Engineering, Turkish Air Force Academy, Istanbul, Turkey"],"firstName":"G\u00fcray","lastName":"Y\u0131lmaz","id":"37987433400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-7697-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7760-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7208348","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":194},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Training","Hyperspectral imaging","Artificial neural networks","Support vector machines","Classification algorithms","Training data"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["geophysical image processing","hyperspectral imaging","image classification","neural nets","support vector machines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hyperspectral image classification","support vector neural network algorithm","aircraft","unmanned aerial vehicles","reliable classification algorithms","nonlinear classification method","learning algorithm","Salinas Valley","California","Okavango Delta","Botswana","NASA EO-1 satellite","Hyperion sensor"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Hyperspectral images","Target detection","Support Vector Neural Networks"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7208348","abstract":"With the developing technology, Hyperspectral images can be obtained with the satellites, aircraft and even unmanned aerial vehicles.

The basic principle in classification algorithms is using characteristics of the data to find classification function that separate the data from each other. Neural Networks are among the non-linear classification method that can perform with high success. But, syntactic classifier has some problems that occur during training. One of this problems is called over-fitting. In many cases, especially in hyperspectral images, regularization is required for preventing the learning algorithm from over fitting the training data. In this study, a regularization scheme that named eigenvalue decay is used to make to this regularization in the training phase of networks. A training method that uses such a regularization scheme provides a margin maximization as in SVM for NNs.

Results suggest that Cohen-Daubechies-Feauveau (CDF) 9/7 integer-coefficient wavelet transform with five levels of spectral subband decomposition would be an efficient spectral decorrelator for onboard lossless hyperspectral image compression.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Lossless hyperspectral image compression using wavelet transform based spectral decorrelation","publicationTitle":"2015 7th International Conference on Recent Advances in Space Technologies (RAST)","doi":"10.1109/RAST.2015.7208350","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 7th International Conference on Recent Advances in Space Technologies (RAST)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7169399/7208298/07208350.pdf","startPage":"251","endPage":"254","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RAST.2015.7208350","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7208298","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7208350","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7208350/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-19 June 2015","displayDocTitle":"Lossless hyperspectral image compression using wavelet transform based spectral decorrelation","conferenceDate":"16-19 June 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7208350/","dateOfInsertion":"20 August 2015","publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15383864","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Lossless hyperspectral image compression using wavelet transform based spectral decorrelation","confLoc":"Istanbul, Turkey","sourcePdf":"251.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060173S","chronDate":"16-19 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7169399","isNumber":"7208298","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7169399","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"7208298","articleId":"7208350","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7208428,"authors":[{"name":"Ozan Zorlu","affiliation":["Computer Engineering Department, Turkish Air Force Academy, Istanbul, Turkey"],"firstName":"Ozan","lastName":"Zorlu","id":"37085545009"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-7697-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7760-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7208428","dbTime":"15 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":307},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7208428","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Genetic algorithms","Vehicles","Vehicle routing","Sociology","Statistics","Biological cells","Routing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["autonomous aerial vehicles","genetic algorithms","path planning"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["unmanned aerial vehicle routing","capacitated vehicle routing problem","CVRP","vehicle routing problem","genetic algorithm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["UAV","Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem","Genetic Algorithm","VRP","CVRP"]}],"abstract":"The Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP), is a capacity constrained type of vehicle routing problem, which is widely studied with many real-world applications.

Secondary goal was to select the most descriptive signal features and sensor locations to be used as inputs to ANNs. Five triaxial accelerometers were attached to human body in the following places: one at back, two at waist laterally and two at both ankles. The set of activities to be recognized was established to include the most often performed actions in home environment. In total 25 subjects performed a set of predefined actions like walking, going up and down the stairs, sitting down and standing up from a chair. Acquired signals were divided into 0.5s time windows by a label defining the action performed. Several statistical signal features were calculated and used to train ANNs. Learning and testing were performed on separate data sets. Analysis using Fisher Linear Discriminant showed that despite the fact that some of the calculated values play a significant role in the distinction between similar activities, none of the features or sensors could be omitted in the recognition of the activities considered in the study. Accuracy of 97% has been achieved for discriminating sitting and walking, 89% for standing, 72-75% for walking the stairs. Transient actions like standing up and sitting down have been detected with accuracy 56% and 38%, respectively. Even though there are studies declaring higher accuracy, none of them considered a set of activities analyzed in this research.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7208482/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-27 June 2015","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"25-27 June 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7208482/","dateOfInsertion":"20 August 2015","publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15383722","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Artificial neural networks in accelerometer-based human activity recognition","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Artificial neural networks in accelerometer-based human activity recognition","confLoc":"Torun, Poland","sourcePdf":"S16.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.094636S","chronDate":"25-27 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7168332","isNumber":"7208464","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7168332","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"7208464","articleId":"7208482","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Department of Microelectronics and Computer Science, Lodz Univeristy of Technology","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7208516,"authors":[{"name":"Abolfazl Zokaei","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, South Tehran Branch: Islamic Azad University, Iran"],"firstName":"Abolfazl","lastName":"Zokaei","id":"37085351565"},{"name":"Amir Amirabadi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, South Tehran Branch: Islamic Azad University, Iran"],"firstName":"Amir","lastName":"Amirabadi","id":"37273603500"},{"name":"Mehdi Ghasemzadeh","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Urmia University, Iran"],"firstName":"Mehdi","lastName":"Ghasemzadeh","id":"37074356900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-8-3635-7807-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-8-3635-7806-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7208516","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":338},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Noise","Transistors","Noise measurement","Harmonic analysis","Wideband","Impedance matching"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS analogue integrated circuits","differential amplifiers","distortion","harmonics suppression","impedance matching","integrated circuit design","integrated circuit noise","low noise amplifiers","microwave amplifiers","wideband amplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wideband low noise amplifier","fully differential linear low noise amplifier","LNA","CMOS process","active post distortion","APD","voltage combiner","linear transconductance","harmonic cancellation","impedance matching device noise","return loss","IIP2","IIP3","power gain","input reverse isolation","size 130 nm","frequency 3.5 GHz to 5 GHz","size 0.308 mm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Low Noise Amplifier","Noise Cancelation","Harmonic Termination","Linearity Improvement"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7208516","doi":"10.1109/MIXDES.2015.7208516","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MIXDES.2015.7208516","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7208464","publicationTitle":"2015 22nd International Conference Mixed Design of Integrated Circuits & Systems (MIXDES)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 22nd International Conference Mixed Design of Integrated Circuits & Systems (MIXDES)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7168332/7208464/07208516.pdf","startPage":"229","endPage":"233","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A 130 nm wideband fully differential linear low noise amplifier","abstract":"In this paper, a wide-band fully differential linear low noise amplifier (LNA) in a standard 130nm CMOS process is presented.

Problems that we have to deal with in this type of implementations are radically different from those that occur in only pure software realizations. Therefore, although there are many available systems to simulate NNs, they are not useful for our purposes. The proposed system allows to investigate the influence of various physical constraints on the learning process of the NN. It enables a modification of more than sixty parameters, so almost any learning scenario, as well as almost each configuration of the NN can be tested. It is possible to run multiple tests in accordance with a created lists of tasks, in which particular parameters are changed in loops with a certain range and with a given step. This allows to carry out in a relatively short time thousands of simulations for different combinations of particular parameters. Finally, it allows to select the most efficient combinations of the parameters looking from the point of view of the effective transistor level implementation.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MIXDES.2015.7208524","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7208464","startPage":"266","endPage":"271","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 22nd International Conference Mixed Design of Integrated Circuits & Systems (MIXDES)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7168332/7208464/07208524.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An advanced software model for optimization of self-organizing neural networks oriented on implementation in hardware","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7208524/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-27 June 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7208524/","displayDocTitle":"An advanced software model for optimization of self-organizing neural networks oriented on implementation in hardware","conferenceDate":"25-27 June 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15383766","dateOfInsertion":"20 August 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An advanced software model for optimization of self-organizing neural networks oriented on implementation in hardware","confLoc":"Torun, Poland","sourcePdf":"19.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.08469S","chronDate":"25-27 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7168332","isNumber":"7208464","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7168332","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7208464","articleId":"7208524","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Department of Microelectronics and Computer Science, Lodz Univeristy of Technology","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7208527,"authors":[{"name":"Tomasz Tala\u015bka","affiliation":["Faculty of Telecommunications, Computer Science and Electrical Engineering, UTP University of Science and Technology, Bydgoszcz, Poland"],"firstName":"Tomasz","lastName":"Tala\u015bka","id":"37294952800"},{"name":"Rafa\u0142 D\u0142ugosz","affiliation":["Faculty of Telecommunications, Computer Science and Electrical Engineering, UTP University of Science and Technology, Bydgoszcz, Poland"],"firstName":"Rafa\u0142","lastName":"D\u0142ugosz","id":"37298868900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-8-3635-7807-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-8-3635-7806-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7208527","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":113},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neurons","Sorting","Artificial neural networks","CMOS integrated circuits","Biological neural networks","Radiation detectors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS integrated circuits","mixed analogue-digital integrated circuits","neural nets","sorting","SPICE","unsupervised learning"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mixed analog-digital circuit","analog sorting signals","neural gas learning algorithm","NG learning algorithm","unsupervised neural networks","nonlinear processing","nonlinear operations","min filtering","max filtering","median filtering","reference ramp signal","sorting operation","TSMC 180nm CMOS technology","HSpice environment","size 180 nm","current 1 muA to 10 muA","power 250 muW"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Sorting circuit","Self-Organizing Neural Networks","Neural Gas learning algorithm","CMOS implementation","Analog signals"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7208527","abstract":"The paper presents a new, mixed analog-digital, circuit for analog sorting signals. In comparison to other circuits of this type the proposed solution offers large versatility. The main objective is its application in Neural Gas (NG) learning algorithm used to train unsupervised neural networks (NNs). However, the circuit can also be used in nonlinear processing of analog signals. It is capable of performing simultaneously several typical nonlinear operations that include Min, Max and Median filtering. The circuit offers high accuracy, however the difference between signals that can be distinguished depends on the steepness of a reference ramp signal. For example, the circuit it able to distinguish signals that differ by 10 nA if the assumed time is larger than 1 \u03bcs. Since a typical number of neurons in the NN exceeds 100-200, the circuit has been designed to sort so many input signals. The sorting operation provides us values of particular output signals, as well as the information which inputs signals deliver particular output signals. This second feature is used in case of the application of the circuit in NN. The system was implemented in the TSMC 180nm CMOS technology and verified in the HSpice environment. For 8 inputs varying in between 1 to 10 \u03bcA the circuit dissipates an average power of 250 \u03bcW.","doi":"10.1109/MIXDES.2015.7208527","startPage":"282","endPage":"286","publicationTitle":"2015 22nd International Conference Mixed Design of Integrated Circuits & Systems (MIXDES)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MIXDES.2015.7208527","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7208464","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 22nd International Conference Mixed Design of Integrated Circuits & Systems (MIXDES)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7168332/7208464/07208527.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analog sorting circuit for the application in self-organizing neural networks based on neural gas learning algorithm","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7208527/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Analog sorting circuit for the application in self-organizing neural networks based on neural gas learning algorithm","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7208527/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"15383804","publicationDate":"June 2015","dateOfInsertion":"20 August 2015","conferenceDate":"25-27 June 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-27 June 2015","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analog sorting circuit for the application in self-organizing neural networks based on neural gas learning algorithm","confLoc":"Torun, Poland","sourcePdf":"112.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.087296S","chronDate":"25-27 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7168332","isNumber":"7208464","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7168332","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7208464","articleId":"7208527","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Department of Microelectronics and Computer Science, Lodz Univeristy of Technology","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7208528,"authors":[{"name":"Andrei Hera","affiliation":["University Politehnica Timisoara, Timisoara, Romania"],"firstName":"Andrei","lastName":"Hera","id":"37085361239"},{"name":"Oana Boncalo","affiliation":["University Politehnica Timisoara, Timisoara, Romania"],"firstName":"Oana","lastName":"Boncalo","id":"37396354200"},{"name":"Constantina-Elena Gavriliu","affiliation":["University Politehnica Timisoara, Timisoara, Romania"],"firstName":"Constantina-Elena","lastName":"Gavriliu","id":"37085357031"},{"name":"Alexandru Amaricai","affiliation":["University Politehnica Timisoara, Timisoara, Romania"],"firstName":"Alexandru","lastName":"Amaricai","id":"37396351700"},{"name":"Valentin Savin","affiliation":["CEA-LETI, MINATEC Campus, Grenoble, France"],"firstName":"Valentin","lastName":"Savin","id":"37085355692"},{"name":"David Declercq","affiliation":["ETIS-ENSEA, Cergy-Pontoise, France"],"firstName":"David","lastName":"Declercq","id":"37085358552"},{"name":"Fakhreddine Ghaffari","affiliation":["ETIS-ENSEA, Cergy-Pontoise, France"],"firstName":"Fakhreddine","lastName":"Ghaffari","id":"37564959200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-8-3635-7807-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-8-3635-7806-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7208528","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":186},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7208528","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Decoding","Iterative decoding","Wireless personal area networks","Pipelines","WiMAX","Radiation detectors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cyclic codes","decoding","parity check codes","telecommunication scheduling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["on-the-fly stopping criteria","layered quasicyclic LDPC decoder architecture","QC low-density parity check decoder scheduling","Xilinx Virtex-7 devices","decoding performance analysis"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["LDPC Decoder","Error Correction Codes","Layered Architecture","Early Termination"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents an analysis of existing stopping criteria for layered architecture used for quasi-cyclic (QC) LDPC decoders.

The proposed ASIC can measure currents as low as -50 fA, a value well below similar ASIC implementations.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MIXDES.2015.7208578","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7208464","startPage":"525","endPage":"529","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 22nd International Conference Mixed Design of Integrated Circuits & Systems (MIXDES)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7168332/7208464/07208578.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design and measurement methodology for a sub-picoampere current digitiser","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7208578/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-27 June 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7208578/","displayDocTitle":"Design and measurement methodology for a sub-picoampere current digitiser","conferenceDate":"25-27 June 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15383740","dateOfInsertion":"20 August 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design and measurement methodology for a sub-picoampere current digitiser","confLoc":"Torun, Poland","sourcePdf":"52.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041312S","chronDate":"25-27 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7168332","isNumber":"7208464","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7168332","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7208464","articleId":"7208578","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Department of Microelectronics and Computer Science, Lodz Univeristy of Technology","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7208582,"authors":[{"name":"Jo\u00e3o L.

Here we present a novel architecture of the PRNG based on the chaotic nonlinear model and pipelined data processing. A significant enhancement in terms of output throughput has been achieved by combining the advantages of pipelining with post-processing based on fast logical operations like bit shifting and XOR. The proposed method has been implemented using programmable SoC Zynq device from Xilinx and verified by standard statistical tests NIST SP800-22. For PRNGs based on the logistic chaotic map and frequency dependent negative resistance (FDNR) we obtained speed-up factors equal to 33% and 14%, respectively. We also present detailed comparison of the proposed post-processing method with the methods reported previously by the other authors. In particular, we compared the maximum output throughput and amount of total logical resources required by PRNG implementation in the programmable SoC device. The maximum output throughput of the proposed PRNG is equal to 38.44 Gbps and is significantly greater comparing to the chaotic PRNGs described so far.","publicationTitle":"2015 22nd International Conference Mixed Design of Integrated Circuits & Systems (MIXDES)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 22nd International Conference Mixed Design of Integrated Circuits & Systems (MIXDES)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7168332/7208464/07208596.pdf","startPage":"607","endPage":"611","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An efficient post-processing method for pipelined pseudo-random number generator in SoC-FPGA","doi":"10.1109/MIXDES.2015.7208596","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7208464","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MIXDES.2015.7208596","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7208596","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7208596/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-27 June 2015","displayDocTitle":"An efficient post-processing method for pipelined pseudo-random number generator in SoC-FPGA","dateOfInsertion":"20 August 2015","publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15383706","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"25-27 June 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7208596/","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An efficient post-processing method for pipelined pseudo-random number generator in SoC-FPGA","confLoc":"Torun, Poland","sourcePdf":"82.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056743S","chronDate":"25-27 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7168332","isNumber":"7208464","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7168332","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7208464","articleId":"7208596","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Department of Microelectronics and Computer Science, Lodz Univeristy of Technology","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7208625,"authors":[{"name":"Harika Manem","affiliation":["College of Nanoscale Science and Engineering, SUNY Polytechnic Institute, Albany, USA"],"firstName":"Harika","lastName":"Manem","id":"37542438300"},{"name":"Karsten Beckmann","affiliation":["College of Nanoscale Science and Engineering, SUNY Polytechnic Institute, Albany, USA"],"firstName":"Karsten","lastName":"Beckmann","id":"37085533768"},{"name":"Min Xu","affiliation":["College of Nanoscale Science and Engineering, SUNY Polytechnic Institute, Albany, USA"],"firstName":"Min","lastName":"Xu","id":"37589904000"},{"name":"Robert Carroll","affiliation":["College of Nanoscale Science and Engineering, SUNY Polytechnic Institute, Albany, USA"],"firstName":"Robert","lastName":"Carroll","id":"37085544088"},{"name":"Robert Geer","affiliation":["College of Nanoscale Science and Engineering, SUNY Polytechnic Institute, Albany, USA"],"firstName":"Robert","lastName":"Geer","id":"37319010000"},{"name":"Nathaniel C.

With the emergence of the memristor, the physical realization of cost-effective artificial neural networks is becoming viable, due to reduced area and increased performance metrics than strictly CMOS implementations. In the work presented here, memristors are utilized as synapses in the realization of a multi-purpose heterogeneous 3D neuromorphic fabric. This paper details our in-house memristor and 3D technologies in the design of a fabric that can perform real-world signal processing (i.e., image/video etc.) as well as everyday Boolean logic applications. The applicability of this fabric is therefore diverse with applications ranging from general-purpose and high performance logic computing to power-conservative image detection for mobile and defense applications. The proposed system is an area-effective heterogeneous 3D integration of memristive neural networks, that consumes significantly less power and allows for high speeds (3D ultra-high bandwidth connectivity) in comparison to a purely CMOS 2D implementation. Images and results provided will illustrate our state of the art 3D and memristor technology capabilities for the realization of the proposed 3D memristive neural fabric. Simulation results also show the results for mapping Boolean logic functions and images onto perceptron based neural networks. Results demonstrate the proof of concept of this system, which is the first step in the physical realization of the multi-purpose heterogeneous 3D memristive neuromorphic fabric.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7208625/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-28 May 2015","publicationDate":"May 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"26-28 May 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7208625/","dateOfInsertion":"20 August 2015","accessionNumber":"15383542","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"An extendable multi-purpose 3D neuromorphic fabric using nanoscale memristors","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An extendable multi-purpose 3D neuromorphic fabric using nanoscale memristors","confLoc":"Verona, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"012cisda15.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.083858S","chronDate":"26-28 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7165058","isNumber":"7208613","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7165058","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"7208613","articleId":"7208625","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7208627,"authors":[{"name":"Ashwin Amanna","affiliation":["ANDRO Computational Solutions, LLC, Rome, NY"],"firstName":"Ashwin","lastName":"Amanna","id":"37402396400"},{"name":"Daniel Ali","affiliation":["Virginia Tech Blacksburg, VA"],"firstName":"Daniel","lastName":"Ali","id":"37077923100"},{"name":"David Gonzalez Fitch","affiliation":["Virginia Tech Blacksburg, VA"],"firstName":"David Gonzalez","lastName":"Fitch","id":"37085532607"},{"name":"Jeffrey H.

Typically, theoretical models poorly match given situations, past experiences are limited, and spectrum sensing of noise and channel conditions pose many hurdles. Hence, traditional cognitive radio engines based on genetic algorithms and case based reasoning have faltered, especially when facing new environments. Our approach uses efficient experimental designs to generate an empirical performance model as an alternate to theoretical models. The procedure systematically probes the system by setting a unique combination of input parameters and transmitting a data file across the link. Performance metrics, such as packet error rate and throughput, associated with each row of a response surface methodology (RSM) design estimate simple models of performance. Goals of this research include validating accuracy of empirical models based on type and efficiency of experimental design, using empirical models in place of theoretical models during the optimization process, and comparing success of an experimental design driven decision compared to a benchmark genetic algorithm cognitive radio engine. Over-the-air implementation on software defined radios demonstrated the statistical approach performing within 4% of a traditional genetic algorithm cognitive engine even in cases where the statistical fit of the estimation model is poor.","doi":"10.1109/CISDA.2015.7208627","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Symposium on Computational Intelligence for Security and Defense Applications (CISDA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7165058/7208613/07208627.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7208613","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CISDA.2015.7208627","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Symposium on Computational Intelligence for Security and Defense Applications (CISDA)","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design of experiments based empirical models to support cognitive radio decision making","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7208627","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-28 May 2015","displayDocTitle":"Design of experiments based empirical models to support cognitive radio decision making","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7208627/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7208627/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2015","accessionNumber":"15383548","dateOfInsertion":"20 August 2015","conferenceDate":"26-28 May 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design of experiments based empirical models to support cognitive radio decision making","confLoc":"Verona, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"014cisda15.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.091214S","chronDate":"26-28 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7165058","isNumber":"7208613","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7165058","xplore-issue":"7208613","articleId":"7208627","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7208630,"authors":[{"name":"J.

Yet progress building these systems has been limited because we lack a design methodology. We present a gene-driven network growth algorithm that enables a genetic algorithm (evolutionary computation) to generate and test SNNs. The genome length for this algorithm grows O(n) where n is the number of neurons; n is also evolved. The genome not only specifies the network topology, but all its parameters as well. In experiments, the algorithm discovered SNNs that effectively produce a robust spike bursting behavior given tonic inputs, an application suitable for central pattern generators. Even though evolution did not include perturbations of the input spike trains, the evolved networks showed remarkable robustness to such perturbations. On a second task, a sequence detector, several related discriminating designs were found, all made \u201cerrors\u201d in that they fired when input spikes were simultaneous (i.e. not strictly in sequence), but not when they were out of sequence. They also fired when the sequence was too close for the teacher to have declared they were in sequence. That is, evolution produced these behaviors even though it was not explicitly rewarded for doing so. We are optimistic that this technology might be scaled up to produce robust SNN designs that humans would be hard pressed to produce.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7208613","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CISDA.2015.7208630","doi":"10.1109/CISDA.2015.7208630","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","pdfPath":"/iel7/7165058/7208613/07208630.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Symposium on Computational Intelligence for Security and Defense Applications (CISDA)","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Symposium on Computational Intelligence for Security and Defense Applications (CISDA)","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7208630","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-28 May 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7208630/","displayDocTitle":"Evolving spiking neural networks: A novel growth algorithm corrects the teacher","conferenceDate":"26-28 May 2015","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"15383565","publicationDate":"May 2015","dateOfInsertion":"20 August 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7208630/","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Evolving spiking neural networks: A novel growth algorithm corrects the teacher","confLoc":"Verona, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"017cisda15.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066552S","chronDate":"26-28 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7165058","isNumber":"7208613","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7165058","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"7208613","articleId":"7208630","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7208631,"authors":[{"name":"Chenyuan Zhao","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of Kansas, Lawrence, KS, USA"],"firstName":"Chenyuan","lastName":"Zhao","id":"37085424592"},{"name":"Wafi Danesh","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of Kansas, Lawrence, KS, USA"],"firstName":"Wafi","lastName":"Danesh","id":"37085404865"},{"name":"Bryant T.

In this paper, we apply RC to channel estimation in Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) systems. Due to the multipath propagation environment between a transmitter and receiver, the received signal undergoes attenuation, time delay and phase shift. For mitigating these random effects and decoding the transmitted signal at the receiver, accurate channel estimation is vital. Statistical approaches for channel estimation assume that accurate channel information is available at the receiver. However, the time-variance of the channel complicates the channel estimation process by making the current estimation outdated. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), which are analogous to the functioning of the human brain, are therefore utilized for channel prediction. Training algorithms for RNNs are categorized as gradient-descent methods, which often results in high computational complexity and leads to non-convergence due to the presence of bifurcations. In this paper, an Echo State Network (ESN), which is a class of RC approach, has been used for training a RNN to estimate the channel state information. Using this approach, the training and hence, the implementation complexity is significantly reduced. Simulation results show significant improvement in channel estimation accuracy for the proposed method.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Channel estimation in wireless OFDM systems using reservoir computing","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Symposium on Computational Intelligence for Security and Defense Applications (CISDA)","doi":"10.1109/CISDA.2015.7208638","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Symposium on Computational Intelligence for Security and Defense Applications (CISDA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7165058/7208613/07208638.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CISDA.2015.7208638","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7208613","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7208638","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7208638/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-28 May 2015","displayDocTitle":"Channel estimation in wireless OFDM systems using reservoir computing","conferenceDate":"26-28 May 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7208638/","dateOfInsertion":"20 August 2015","publicationDate":"May 2015","accessionNumber":"15383543","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Channel estimation in wireless OFDM systems using reservoir computing","confLoc":"Verona, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"025cisda15.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054263S","chronDate":"26-28 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7165058","isNumber":"7208613","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7165058","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7208613","articleId":"7208638","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7208644,"authors":[{"name":"Syed Shariyar Murtaza","affiliation":["Software Behaviour Analysis (SBA) Research Lab ECE, Concordia University, Montreal, QC, Canada"],"firstName":"Syed Shariyar","lastName":"Murtaza","id":"37649301600"},{"name":"Wael Khreich","affiliation":["Software Behaviour Analysis (SBA) Research Lab ECE, Concordia University, Montreal, QC, Canada"],"firstName":"Wael","lastName":"Khreich","id":"37679885000"},{"name":"Abdelwahab Hamou-Lhadj","affiliation":["Software Behaviour Analysis (SBA) Research Lab ECE, Concordia University, Montreal, QC, Canada"],"firstName":"Abdelwahab","lastName":"Hamou-Lhadj","id":"37282690000"},{"name":"Stephane Gagnon","affiliation":["Departement des sciences administratives, Universit\u00e9 du Qu\u00e9bec en Outaouais, Gatineau, QC, Canada"],"firstName":"Stephane","lastName":"Gagnon","id":"38047017800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7557-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-7556-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2329-6267"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2329-6275"}],"articleNumber":"7208644","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":308},"abstract":"High false alarm rates and execution times are among the key issues in host-based anomaly detection systems.

As their popularity has increased, so has the urgency to protect and defend these networks. The decentralized nature of ZigBee ad-hoc networks creates unique security challenges for maintaining network security and intrusion detection. RF-fingerprinting provides a unique physical (PHY) layer defense against node counterfeiting by identifying rogue devices through their RF-emissions. In previous work, feature generation from received RF signals was accomplished with parametric variables such as standard deviation, variance, skewness, and kurtosis, all based on the assumption of a normal distribution of a particular region of interest. We show in this work that most collected signals are either multi-modal or non-parametric. Use of non-parametric methods for feature generation such as mean, median, mode, and trend represented by linear model coefficient estimates are shown to be much more applicable to the non-parametric distribution of the collected ZigBee preamble, resulting in improved classification performance of devices. Non-parametric classifier Random Forest is used with both parametric and non-parametric features to provide a classification performance comparison. Performance improvements of upto 9% in correct classification rates have been achieved and an effective gain of 4 dB SNR was realized.\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1</sup>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7208645/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-28 May 2015","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"26-28 May 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7208645/","dateOfInsertion":"20 August 2015","publicationDate":"May 2015","accessionNumber":"15383558","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Non-parametric feature generation for RF-fingerprinting on ZigBee devices","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Non-parametric feature generation for RF-fingerprinting on ZigBee devices","confLoc":"Verona, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"032cisda15.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057334S","chronDate":"26-28 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7165058","isNumber":"7208613","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7165058","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"7208613","articleId":"7208645","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7208692,"authors":[{"name":"Leos Kukacka","affiliation":["LAPLACE, UMR 5213 (CNRS, INPT, UPS), Universit\u00e9 de Toulouse, Toulouse, France","Institute of Mechatronics and Computer Engineering FMIIS, Technical, University of Liberec, Czech republic"],"firstName":"Leos","lastName":"Kukacka","id":"37085412948"},{"name":"Pascal Dupuis","affiliation":["LAPLACE, UMR 5213 (CNRS, INPT, UPS), Universit\u00e9 de Toulouse, Toulouse, France"],"firstName":"Pascal","lastName":"Dupuis","id":"37346225400"},{"name":"Georges Zissis","affiliation":["LAPLACE, UMR 5213 (CNRS, INPT, UPS), Universit\u00e9 de Toulouse, Toulouse, France"],"firstName":"Georges","lastName":"Zissis","id":"37272137900"},{"name":"Jan Kraus","affiliation":["Technicka univerzita v Liberci, Liberec, Liberec Region, CZ"],"firstName":"Jan","lastName":"Kraus","id":"38529108500"},{"name":"Milan Kolar","affiliation":["Institute of Mechatronics and Computer Engineering FMIIS, Technical, University of Liberec, Czech republic"],"firstName":"Milan","lastName":"Kolar","id":"37085564138"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-6972-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-6970-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-6971-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7208692","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":215},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Electronic ballasts","LED lamps","Frequency measurement","Voltage fluctuations","Low voltage"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["flicker noise","lamp accessories","LED lamps","lighting","photometry","reverse engineering"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["extra low voltage DC grid LED lighting systems","photometric flicker analysis","LED lighting systems flicker","ELV LED lamps flicker","nominal DC voltage","reverse engineering methods","electronic ballast topology","DC LED lamp ballasts"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["LED Lamp","DC Grid","Power Quality","Flicker"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7208692","doi":"10.1109/ECMSM.2015.7208692","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ECMSM.2015.7208692","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7208673","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Workshop of Electronics, Control, Measurement, Signals and their Application to Mechatronics (ECMSM)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Workshop of Electronics, Control, Measurement, Signals and their Application to Mechatronics (ECMSM)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7182695/7208673/07208692.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Extra low voltage DC grid LED lighting systems: photometric flicker analysis","abstract":"The paper exposes the topic of LED lighting systems flicker.

Vision-based SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) proposes to solve this problem by combining the estimation of the vehicle state (localisation : position and orientation) and an incremental modelling of the environment using a perception module (feature detection and matching) in images acquired using one camera or more. Such a perception module requires an important computational load that highly affects the latency and the throughput of the system. Our goal is to implement the SLAM functionality on a low power consumption mixed hardware and software architecture (using a co-design approach) based on a Xilinx Zynq FPGA. This device includes logic cells that allows to speed-up the perception tasks to meet the real-time constraint of an ADAS. In this paper, we present the implementation of two hardware components : a FAST (Features from Accelerated Segment Test) features detector and a parametrizable corner refinement module (Non Maxima Suppression - NMS).","doi":"10.1109/ECMSM.2015.7208697","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Workshop of Electronics, Control, Measurement, Signals and their Application to Mechatronics (ECMSM)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Workshop of Electronics, Control, Measurement, Signals and their Application to Mechatronics (ECMSM)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7182695/7208673/07208697.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ECMSM.2015.7208697","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7208673","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"FPGA based accelerator for visual features detection","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7208697","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"FPGA based accelerator for visual features detection","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 June 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7208697/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"22-24 June 2015","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15384341","dateOfInsertion":"20 August 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7208697/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FPGA based accelerator for visual features detection","confLoc":"Liberec, Czech Republic","sourcePdf":"ID30_Brenot_Francois.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.089877S","chronDate":"22-24 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7182695","isNumber":"7208673","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7182695","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"7208673","articleId":"7208697","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7208698,"authors":[{"name":"Mario Sch\u00f6lzel","affiliation":["IHP Frankfurt (Oder) and University of Potsdam, Germany"],"firstName":"Mario","lastName":"Sch\u00f6lzel","id":"37393515900"},{"name":"Patryk Skoncej","affiliation":["IHP Frankfurt (Oder) and BTU Cottbus-Senftenberg, Germany"],"firstName":"Patryk","lastName":"Skoncej","id":"37077499200"},{"name":"Frank Vater","affiliation":["IHP Frankfurt (Oder), Germany"],"firstName":"Frank","lastName":"Vater","id":"37993244100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-6972-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-6970-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-6971-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7208698","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":65},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Random access memory","Memory management","Redundancy","Embedded systems","Flash memories","Circuit faults","Maintenance engineering"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["embedded systems","fault diagnosis","flash memories","integrated circuit manufacture","integrated circuit reliability","production engineering computing","software engineering"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["embedded memories","software-based technique","low-cost memories","program code adaptation","faulty memory words","permanent manufacturing fault handling","hardware-based fault management","low-cost embedded systems","sensor nodes","program memory","flash memory devices","program memories","hardware-overhead"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents a software-based technique for handling permanent faults in low-cost memories for embedded systems.

This is of particular interest for long living low-cost embedded systems like sensor nodes that make use of such memories. Different methods for handling memory faults in data and program memory are discussed. The methods for program memories are evaluated with flash memory devices.

To enhance the energy efficiency and as a measure of energy conservation, incandescent lamps (IL) are replaced with the modern lights. Replacing incandescent lamps with compact fluorescent lamp (CFL) and fluorescent lamp (FL) is one of the measures taken by the authorities to reduce the energy consumption and enhance energy efficiency. Both the CFLs and LEDs are the sources of harmonics as electronic circuits are used in for their ignition. These harmonic sources adversely affect other loads connected to the same bus. It also affects the grid in terms of high reactive power demand (due to poor power factor), distortion in currents and hence overall degrading the power quality. Power quality measurements such as power factor, voltage and current total harmonic distortion (THD) are done and reported in this paper. Different scenarios are considered with full and partial replacement of incandescent lamps. A comprehensive comparison between incandescent, CFL and LED are made in terms of these power quality measurements. From the result analysis, it is noted that, the CFL consumes less active power than incandescent. But, the THD is considerably higher in CFL than incandescent. While comparing LED and CFL, the power factor of LED is found poor compared to CFL. The simulation and experimental approaches are used in this work.","doi":"10.1109/SGRE.2015.7208731","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SGRE.2015.7208731","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 First Workshop on Smart Grid and Renewable Energy (SGRE)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7182696/7208605/07208731.pdf","publicationTitle":"2015 First Workshop on Smart Grid and Renewable Energy (SGRE)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7208605","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Power quality effect of using incandescent, fluorescent, CFL and LED lamps on utility grid","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"22-23 March 2015","displayDocTitle":"Power quality effect of using incandescent, fluorescent, CFL and LED lamps on utility grid","conferenceDate":"22-23 March 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2015","dateOfInsertion":"20 August 2015","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7208731/","accessionNumber":"15384373","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7208731/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Power quality effect of using incandescent, fluorescent, CFL and LED lamps on utility grid","confLoc":"Doha, Qatar","sourcePdf":"26sgre002755.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04935S","chronDate":"22-23 March 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7182696","isNumber":"7208605","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7182696","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"7208605","articleId":"7208731","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7208732,"authors":[{"name":"Xingda Yan","affiliation":["Eletro-mechanical Research Group University of Southampton, Southampton, United Kingdom"],"firstName":"Xingda","lastName":"Yan","id":"37085347120"},{"name":"Zhan Shu","affiliation":["Eletro-mechanical Research Group University of Southampton, Southampton, United Kingdom"],"firstName":"Zhan","lastName":"Shu","id":"37277178100"},{"name":"Suleiman M.

The CSRR is etched in the ground plane of the planar microstrip line. Two CSRRs of rectangular and circular cross-sections are chosen for the sensitivity analysis, where the later is found to possess higher sensitivity and hence appears to be more appropriate for the sensor design. At resonance, the electric field induced along the plane of CSRR is found to be quite sensitive for the characterization of specimen kept in contact with the sensor. A numerical model is developed here for the calculation of the complex permittivity as a function of resonant frequency and the quality factor data using the electromagnetic simulator, the Computer Simulation Technology. For practical applications, a detailed air gap analysis is carried out to consider the effect of any air gap present between the test sample and the CSRR. The designed sensor is fabricated and tested, and accordingly the numerically established relations are experimentally verified for various reference samples e.g., teflon, polyvinyl chloride, plexiglas, polyethylene, rubber, and wood. Experimentally, it is found that the permittivity measurement using the proposed sensor is possible with a typical error of 3%.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design and Application of the CSRR-Based Planar Sensor for Noninvasive Measurement of Complex Permittivity","publicationTitle":"IEEE Sensors Journal","doi":"10.1109/JSEN.2015.2469683","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Sensors Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/7361/7286895/07208784.pdf","startPage":"7181","endPage":"7189","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSEN.2015.2469683","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7286895","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7208784","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7208784/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 August 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2015","displayDocTitle":"Design and Application of the CSRR-Based Planar Sensor for Noninvasive Measurement of Complex Permittivity","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"15","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/7208784/","dateOfInsertion":"14 October 2015","publicationDate":"Dec. 2015","accessionNumber":"15518954","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design and Application of the CSRR-Based Planar Sensor for Noninvasive Measurement of Complex Permittivity","sourcePdf":"jsen-jha-2469683-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.069914S","chronDate":"Dec.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"7361","isNumber":"7286895","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7361","citationCount":"142","xplore-issue":"7286895","articleId":"7208784","onlineDate":"18 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7208789,"authors":[{"name":"Junho Yeo","affiliation":["College of Information and Communication Engineering, Daegu University, Gyeongsan, Republic of Korea"],"firstName":"Junho","lastName":"Yeo","id":"37281405600"},{"name":"Jong-Ig Lee","affiliation":["Div. of Mechatronics Engineering, Dongseo University, Busan, Republic of Korea"],"firstName":"Jong-Ig","lastName":"Lee","id":"37336628500"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1536-1225"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1548-5757"}],"articleNumber":"7208789","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":34,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1960},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society","url":"http://www.ieeeaps.org/"}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Bandwidth Enhancement of Double-Dipole Quasi-Yagi Antenna Using Stepped Slotline Structure","abstract":"In this letter, a method to enhance the bandwidth of a double-dipole quasi-Yagi antenna using a stepped slotline structure is presented.

We aim at precise TomoSAR reconstruction while significantly reducing the required number of images by incorporating building a priori knowledge to the estimation. In the paper, we propose a novel workflow that marries the freely available geographic information systems (GIS) data (i.e., 2-D building footprints) and the joint sparsity concept for TomoSAR inversion. Experiments on bistatic TanDEM-X data stacks demonstrate the great potential of the proposed approach, e.g., highly accurate tomographic reconstruction is achieved using six interferograms only.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/4200690/7327073/07208791.pdf","startPage":"1498","endPage":"1509","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/JSTSP.2015.2469646","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSTSP.2015.2469646","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7327073","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7208791","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint Sparsity in SAR Tomography for Urban Mapping","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Geopgraphic information systems","Synthetic aperture radar","Tomography","Feature extraction","Compressed sensing","Image reconstruction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["geographic information systems","image reconstruction","image resolution","radar imaging","radar resolution","remote sensing by radar","spaceborne radar","synthetic aperture radar","tomography"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["synthetic aperture radar satellite","SAR tomography","joint sparsity","urban mapping","meter-resolution image","TomoSAR reconstruction","geographic information systems","GIS","TomoSAR inversion","bistatic TanDEM-X data stack"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Compressive sensing","GIS","joint sparsity","SAR tomography","synthetic aperture radar","TanDEM-X"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7208791/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 August 2015","displayDocTitle":"Joint Sparsity in SAR Tomography for Urban Mapping","volume":"9","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/7208791/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2015","accessionNumber":"15676855","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","isOpenAccess":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"DLR e.V.

For blind phase tracking, we present and discuss the implementation of feedback loop and digital phase tracking. We then analyze in detail the performance of a decision-direct-free blind scheme, in which only three test phases are required for phase noise compensation. We show that the decision-direct-free blind scheme is transparent to QAM formats, and can provide a similar performance to the conventional blind phase search employing 16 test phases. We also propose two novel cost functions to further reduce the complexity of this scheme.","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave

this letter, according to the two design principles of uniform distribution and less element shadowing for effective aperture, a novel two-dimensional (2-D) sparse ultrawideband (UWB) multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) antenna array topology is optimized and proposed for short-range high-resolution imaging. During the optimization, a \u201cgrid method\u201d (GM) is proposed to judge the uniformity of effective aperture, and of which the maximum shadowing number (MSN) is obtained by the projection slice method. Compared to other two different arrays having the same number of transceivers, the proposed optimal array has a better control over the sidelobe level (SL) both in the interference region (IR) and non-interference region (NIR) of the simulated radiation patterns, from which the peak sidelobe levels (PSLs) of the optimal array obtained are lower than the compared ones over 2 dB. Experimental imaging results for a mannequin target also verify the outstanding imaging capability of the proposed array. Therefore, with a small number of effective elements, the proposed array topology has potential applications for high-efficiency UWB short-range imaging.","doi":"10.1109/LAWP.2015.2469759","publicationTitle":"IEEE Antennas and Wireless Propagation Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Antennas and Wireless Propagation Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/7727/7398195/07208797.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LAWP.2015.2469759","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7398195","startPage":"702","endPage":"705","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Novel Two-Dimensional Sparse MIMO Array Topology for UWB Short-Range Imaging","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7208797","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A Novel Two-Dimensional Sparse MIMO Array Topology for UWB Short-Range Imaging","chronOrPublicationDate":"2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7208797/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 August 2015","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"15","publicationDate":"2016","accessionNumber":"15829909","dateOfInsertion":"10 March 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7208797/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"863 Program","grantNumber":"2012AA061403"},{"fundingName":"NST Pillar Program","grantNumber":"2014BAK12B00"},{"fundingName":"Technical Program of BTI","grantNumber":"TC1405473"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Novel Two-Dimensional Sparse MIMO Array Topology for UWB Short-Range Imaging","sourcePdf":"lawp-tan-2469759-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.062122S","chronDate":"2016","xplore-pub-id":"7727","isNumber":"7398195","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7727","citationCount":"26","xplore-issue":"7398195","articleId":"7208797","onlineDate":"18 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7208799,"authors":[{"name":"Jianwei Xie","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Maryland, College Park, MD, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5/7270357/7208799/xie-2445914-small.gif","p":["\nJianwei Xie received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in electronic engineering from the Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, in 2006 and 2008, respectively.

We present main enabling tools and resulting communication schemes in an expository manner, along with key insights and design principles emerging from them. The main achievable schemes are based on real interference alignment, channel prefixing via cooperative jamming, and structured signalling. Real interference alignment enables aligning the cooperative jamming signals together with the message carrying signals at the eavesdroppers to protect them akin to one-time-pad protecting messages in wired systems. Real interference alignment also enables decodability at the legitimate receivers by rendering message carrying and cooperative jamming signals separable, and simultaneously aligning the cooperative jamming signals in the smallest possible subspace. The main converse techniques are based on two key lemmas which quantify the secrecy penalty by showing that the net effect of an eavesdropper on the system is that it eliminates one of the independent channel inputs; and the role of a helper by developing a direct relationship between the cooperative jamming signal of a helper and the message rate. These two lemmas when applied according to the unique structure of individual networks provide tight converses. Finally, we present a blind cooperative jamming scheme for the helper network with no eavesdropper channel state information at the transmitters that achieves the same optimal s.d.o.f. as in the case of full eavesdropper channel state information.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Secure Degrees of Freedom of Multiuser Networks: One-Time-Pads in the Air via Alignment","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","doi":"10.1109/JPROC.2015.2445914","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel7/5/7270357/07208799.pdf","startPage":"1857","endPage":"1873","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JPROC.2015.2445914","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7270357","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7208799","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7208799/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 August 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2015","displayDocTitle":"Secure Degrees of Freedom of Multiuser Networks: One-Time-Pads in the Air via Alignment","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"103","issue":"10","htmlLink":"/document/7208799/","dateOfInsertion":"16 September 2015","publicationDate":"Oct. 2015","accessionNumber":"15456804","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"NSF","grantNumber":"CNS 09-64632, CCF 09-64645, CCF 10-18185 and CNS 11-47811"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Secure Degrees of Freedom of Multiuser Networks: One-Time-Pads in the Air via Alignment","sourcePdf":"jproc-ulukus-2445914-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.201314S","chronDate":"Oct.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"5","isNumber":"7270357","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7270357","articleId":"7208799","onlineDate":"18 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7208800,"authors":[{"name":"Galal Omer","affiliation":["School of Agricultural, Earth, and Environmental Sciences, Pietermaritzburg Campus, University of KwaZulu-Natal, Pietermaritzburg, South Africa","University of Khartoum, Khartoum North, Sudan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4609443/7377134/7208800/gomer-2461136-small.gif","p":["Galal Omer received the M.Sc. degree in forest science from the University of Khartoum, Khartoum, Sudan, in 2009, and is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree at the School of Agricultural, Earth, and Environmental Sciences, University of KwaZulu-Natal, Pietermaritzburg, South Africa.","He is a Lecturer with the Faculty of Forestry, University of Khartoum, Sudan.

Such aspects include ecological, economic, livelihood, and security-based and well-being benefits. The development of techniques for mapping and monitoring ETS is thus critical for understanding functioning of ecosystems. The advent of advanced imaging systems and supervised learning algorithms has provided an opportunity to map ETS over fragmenting areas. Recently, vegetation maps have been produced using advanced imaging systems such as WorldView-2 (WV-2) and robust classification algorithms such as support vector machines (SVM) and artificial neural network (ANN). However, delineation of ETS in a fragmenting ecosystem using high-resolution imagery has largely remained elusive due to the complexity of the species structure and their distribution. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to examine the utility of the advanced WV-2 data for mapping ETS in the fragmenting Dukuduku indigenous forest of South Africa using SVM and ANN classification algorithms. Specifically, the study looked at testing the advent of the additional WV-2 bands in mapping six ETS. WV-2 image was spectrally resized to separate four standard bands (SB) and four additional bands (AB). WV-2 image (8 bands: 8B) together with the SB and AB subsets was classified using SVM and ANN methods. The results showed the robustness of the two machine learning algorithms with an overall accuracy (OA) of 77.00% for SVM and 75.00% for ANN using 8B. The SB produced OA of 65.00% for SVM and 64.00% for ANN. The AB produced almost the same OA of 70.00% for both SVM and ANN. There were significant differences between the performances of the two algorithms as demonstrated by the results of McNemar's test (${\\text Z}\\;\\text {score} \\geq {1}.{96}$). This study concludes that SVM and ANN classification algorithms with WV-2 8B have the potential to map ETS in the Dukuduku indigenous forest. This study offers relatively accurate information that is important for forest managers to make informed decisions regarding management and conservation protocols of ETS.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7377134","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSTARS.2015.2461136","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel7/4609443/7377134/07208800.pdf","startPage":"4825","endPage":"4840","doi":"10.1109/JSTARS.2015.2461136","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance of Support Vector Machines and Artificial Neural Network for Mapping Endangered Tree Species Using WorldView-2 Data in Dukuduku Forest, South Africa","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2015","displayDocTitle":"Performance of Support Vector Machines and Artificial Neural Network for Mapping Endangered Tree Species Using WorldView-2 Data in Dukuduku Forest, South Africa","volume":"8","issue":"10","htmlLink":"/document/7208800/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2015","accessionNumber":"15697238","dateOfInsertion":"08 January 2016","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7208800/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 August 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance of Support Vector Machines and Artificial Neural Network for Mapping Endangered Tree Species Using WorldView-2 Data in Dukuduku Forest, South Africa","sourcePdf":"jstars-omer-2461136-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.214715S","chronDate":"Oct.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"4609443","isNumber":"7377134","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4609443","citationCount":"54","xplore-issue":"7377134","articleId":"7208800","onlineDate":"18 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-04"},{"_id":7208803,"authors":[{"name":"Zhibin Xie","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Information, University of Warwick, Coventry, U.K."],"firstName":"Zhibin","lastName":"Xie","id":"37085617966"},{"name":"Yunfei Chen","affiliation":["School of Engineering, University of Warwick, Coventry, U.K."],"firstName":"Yunfei","lastName":"Chen","id":"37281026600"},{"name":"Yan Gao","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Information, Nanjing College of Information Technology, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Yan","lastName":"Gao","id":"37085610694"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2162-2337"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2162-2345"}],"articleNumber":"7208803","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":429},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7208803","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interference","Femtocells","Wireless communication","Macrocell networks","Information rates","Antennas","Iterative methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["energy harvesting","interference suppression","iterative methods","multiuser channels","radio networks","radiofrequency interference","telecommunication power management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiuser wireless network performance degradation","joint iterative interference alignment and energy harvesting","RF energy harvesting","interference reduction","distributed IA","IA alternating minimization","tradeoff decision criterion","operation switches"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Energy harvesting","interference alignment"]},{"kwd":["Energy harvesting","interference alignment"]}],"abstract":"In a wireless network with multiple users, interferences cause performance degradation as well as provide extra opportunities for harvesting RF energies.

Orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) has been considered for these intensity-modulated/direct-detection (IM/DD) optical channels, however, it suffers from high peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR). Moreover, the implementation of linear, power-efficient, high-current, wideband drivers is challenging. In this paper, the concept of spatial summing is developed where wideband, high PAPR OFDM signals are partitioned into many low-PAPR narrowband signals that are transmitted from multiple LEDs. The signals from different LEDs are allowed to sum in space before being detected by a conventional OFDM receiver. Spatial optical-OFDM (SO-OFDM) is proposed in which filtered subsets of carriers are emitted by each LED. In addition, low-PAPR optical single-carrier FDMA (OSC-FDMA) is developed where different collections of LEDs act as virtual users in a multiple-access scheme. The different variations of SO-OFDM and OSC-FDMA are compared to conventional DC-biased optical (DCO) OFDM and are shown to achieve lower PAPR and more robustness to LED nonlinearities leading to error rate performance gains at high signal-to-noise ratios.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2015.2469285","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2015.2469285","startPage":"4304","endPage":"4313","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/7328780/07208804.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7328780","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Visible Light Communications Using OFDM and Multiple LEDs","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7208804/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 August 2015","displayDocTitle":"Visible Light Communications Using OFDM and Multiple LEDs","volume":"63","issue":"11","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"13 November 2015","accessionNumber":"15676746","publicationDate":"Nov. 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7208804/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000038","fundingName":"Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Visible Light Communications Using OFDM and Multiple LEDs","sourcePdf":"tcomm-hranilovic-2469285-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.157591S","chronDate":"Nov.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"7328780","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"85","xplore-issue":"7328780","articleId":"7208804","onlineDate":"18 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7208805,"authors":[{"name":"Chun-Tao Lin","affiliation":["Institute of Communications Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/7328780/7208805/lin-2469781_print-small.gif","p":["\nChun-Tao Lin (M'12) received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering from National Chung Cheng University, Chiayi, Taiwan, in 2002 and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in communications engineering from National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan, in 2004 and 2012, respectively.","He is currently a Postdoctoral Research Fellow with the Institute of Communications Engineering, National Chiao Tung University.

The resultant system, referred to as generalized SM (GSM), can use the maximum-likelihood (ML) detector jointly detecting the antenna-subset (AS) index and symbol vector. As known, the ML detector can achieve optimum performance; however, its computational complexity can be prohibitively high when the dimension of the GSM system is large. In this paper, we propose new methods to solve the problem. The main idea is to split the detection into two stages, one for the AS index and the other for the symbol vector. For the detection of the AS index, we develop two methods, referred to as Gaussian approximation and QR projection. Once the AS index is detected, conventional low-complexity ML detectors can be applied for the detection of the symbol vector. The diversity order for the proposed methods are further analyzed and an enhanced method is also proposed to achieve near-optimum performance. Finally, the proposed methods are extended to conduct soft detection of GSM systems. Simulations show that our methods significantly outperform existing ones while the detection complexity remains similar.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2015.2469781","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7328780","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2015.2469781","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/7328780/07208805.pdf","startPage":"4214","endPage":"4230","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Low-Complexity ML Detectors for Generalized Spatial Modulation Systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 August 2015","displayDocTitle":"Low-Complexity ML Detectors for Generalized Spatial Modulation Systems","volume":"63","issue":"11","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2015","dateOfInsertion":"13 November 2015","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7208805/","publicationDate":"Nov. 2015","accessionNumber":"15676742","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7208805/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001868","fundingName":"National Science Council","grantNumber":"NSC 101-2221-E-009-095-MY3"},{"fundingName":"Aim for the Top University Plan (ATU)"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low-Complexity ML Detectors for Generalized Spatial Modulation Systems","sourcePdf":"tcomm-lin-2469781-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.173719S","chronDate":"Nov.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"7328780","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"34","xplore-issue":"7328780","articleId":"7208805","onlineDate":"18 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7208806,"authors":[{"name":"Changbae Yoon","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST), Daejeon, Korea"],"firstName":"Changbae","lastName":"Yoon","id":"37085371622"},{"name":"Dong-Ho Cho","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST), Daejeon, Korea"],"firstName":"Dong-Ho","lastName":"Cho","id":"37276179200"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-7798"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2558"},{"format":"CD","value":"2373-7891"}],"articleNumber":"7208806","dbTime":"22 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":35,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1381},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"abstract":"The need for a new version of a next-generation wireless communication system to handle coinstantaneous downlink (DL) and uplink (UL) traffic is increasing as the asymmetry in DL and UL traffic increases and the traffic flows become more variable.

Simulation results show that the system developed is more energy efficient to a remarkable degree than conventional algorithms.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/4234/7294672/07208806.pdf","startPage":"1806","endPage":"1809","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","doi":"10.1109/LCOMM.2015.2469294","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LCOMM.2015.2469294","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7294672","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7208806","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Energy Efficient Beamforming and Power Allocation in Dynamic TDD Based C-RAN System","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Array signal processing","Resource management","Interference","Heuristic algorithms","Optimization","Algorithm design and analysis","Downlink"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","radio access networks","telecommunication power management","time division multiplexing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["energy efficient beamforming","power allocation","TDD based C-RAN system","next generation wireless communication system","coinstantaneous downlink-uplink traffic","downlink transmit beamforming algorithm","downlink radio remote heads","cloud radio access network","time division duplex"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["dynamic TDD","coexisting downlink and uplink","beamforming","power allocation","energy efficiency","C-RAN"]},{"kwd":["Dynamic TDD","coexisting downlink and uplink","beamforming","power allocation","energy efficiency","C-RAN"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7208806/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 August 2015","displayDocTitle":"Energy Efficient Beamforming and Power Allocation in Dynamic TDD Based C-RAN System","volume":"19","issue":"10","htmlLink":"/document/7208806/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2015","accessionNumber":"15520405","dateOfInsertion":"08 October 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"ICT R&D program of MSIP/IITP","grantNumber":"14-000-04-001"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy Efficient Beamforming and Power Allocation in Dynamic TDD Based C-RAN System","sourcePdf":"lcomm-cho-2469294-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.074814S","chronDate":"Oct.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"4234","isNumber":"7294672","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4234","citationCount":"35","xplore-issue":"7294672","articleId":"7208806","onlineDate":"18 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7208807,"authors":[{"name":"Kaya Tutuncuoglu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/7328780/7208807/tutun-2469692_print-small.gif","p":["\nKaya Tutuncuoglu (S'08) received the two B.S. degrees in electrical and electronics engineering and in physics from the Middle East Technical University, Ankara, Turkey, in 2008 and 2009, respectively.

In particular, the jointly optimal transmit power and energy transfer policies that maximize sum-throughput for the two-way, two-hop, and multiple access channels are identified. It is shown for nodes with infinite-sized batteries that delaying energy transfers until energy is needed immediately at the receiving node is sum-throughput optimal. Focusing on such procrastinating policies without loss of optimality, the stated joint optimization problem can be decomposed into energy transfer and consumed energy allocation problems which are solved in tandem. This decomposition is shown to hold for the finite-sized battery case as well, using partially procrastinating policies that avoid battery overflows. It is observed that for the two-hop channel, the proposed algorithm has a two fluid water-filling interpretation, and for the multiple access channel, it reduces to a single transmitter problem with aggregate energy arrivals. Numerical results demonstrate the throughput improvement with bi-directional energy cooperation over no cooperation and uni-directional cooperation.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Energy Harvesting Networks With Energy Cooperation: Procrastinating Policies","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2015.2469692","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/7328780/07208807.pdf","startPage":"4525","endPage":"4538","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2015.2469692","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7328780","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7208807","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7208807/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 August 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2015","displayDocTitle":"Energy Harvesting Networks With Energy Cooperation: Procrastinating Policies","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"63","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/7208807/","dateOfInsertion":"13 November 2015","publicationDate":"Nov. 2015","accessionNumber":"15676745","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"CNS 09-64364 and CCF 14-22347"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy Harvesting Networks With Energy Cooperation: Procrastinating Policies","sourcePdf":"tcomm-yener-2469692-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.106267S","chronDate":"Nov.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"7328780","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"38","xplore-issue":"7328780","articleId":"7208807","onlineDate":"18 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7208814,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaocong Lian","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Information, Northwestern Polytechnical University, X\u2019ian, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/76/7372356/7208814/lian-2469572-small.gif","p":["Xiaocong Lian (S\u201915) received the B.S. degree in electronic science and technology from Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi\u2019an, China, in 2013.","His research interests include algorithms and very-large-scale integration implementation for video coding."]},"firstName":"Xiaocong","lastName":"Lian","id":"37085378062"},{"name":"Zhenyu Liu","affiliation":["Tsinghua National Laboratory for Information Science and Technology, Research Institute of Information Technology, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/76/7372356/7208814/liu-2469572-small.gif","p":["Zhenyu Liu (M\u201907) received the B.E., M.E., and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China, in 1996, 1999, and 2002, respectively.","He held a post-doctoral position with Tsinghua University, Beijing, from 2002 to 2004, where he concentrated on the embedded processor architecture design.

With the ultrahigh-definition video specifications, the power consumed by accessing reference frames in the external DRAM has become the bottleneck for the portable video encoding system design. To relieve the dynamic power stresses introduced by the DRAM, a lossless compression algorithm is devised to reduce the external traffic and the memory requirements of reference frames. First, pixel-granularity directional prediction is adopted to decrease the prediction residual energy by 54.1% over the previous horizontal prediction. Second, the dynamic \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">k</i>\nth-order unary/Exp-Golomb rice coding is applied to accommodate the large-valued prediction residues. With the aforementioned techniques, an average data traffic reduction of 68.5% for the off-chip reference frames is obtained, which consequently reduces the dynamic power requirements of the DRAM by 42.3%. Based on the high data reduction ratio of the proposed compression algorithm, a partition group table-based storage space reduction scheme is provided to improve the utilization of row buffers in the DRAM. Consequently, an additional 14.5% of the DRAM dynamic power can be saved by reducing the number of row buffer activations. In total, a 56.8% decrease in the dynamic power requirements of the external reference frame access can be obtained using our strategies. With TSMC 65-nm CMOS logic technology, our algorithm was implemented in a parallel VLSI architecture based on a compressor and decompressor at the cost of 36.5k and 34.7k, respectively, in terms of gate count. The throughputs of the proposed compressor and decompressor are 1.54 and 0.78 Gpixels/s, which are suitable for quad full high definition (4K) @ 94 frames/s real-time encoding with the level-D reference data reuse scheme.","doi":"10.1109/TCSVT.2015.2469572","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/76/7372356/07208814.pdf","startPage":"223","endPage":"235","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7372356","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSVT.2015.2469572","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Lossless Frame Memory Compression Using Pixel-Grain Prediction and Dynamic Order Entropy Coding","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7208814","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2016","displayDocTitle":"Lossless Frame Memory Compression Using Pixel-Grain Prediction and Dynamic Order Entropy Coding","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7208814/","publicationDate":"Jan. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"05 January 2016","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"15689044","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7208814/","volume":"26","issue":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 August 2015","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"60902101"},{"fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds through the Central Universities","grantNumber":"3102014JCQ01057"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Lossless Frame Memory Compression Using Pixel-Grain Prediction and Dynamic Order Entropy Coding","sourcePdf":"tcsvt-lian-2469572-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.10177S","chronDate":"Jan.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"76","isNumber":"7372356","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"76","citationCount":"24","xplore-issue":"7372356","articleId":"7208814","onlineDate":"18 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7208816,"authors":[{"name":"Manjinder Nir","affiliation":["Department of Systems and Computer Engineering, Carleton University, Ottawa, ON, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6245519/8307205/7208816/nir-2469665-small.gif","p":["Manjinder Nir received the BTech and MTech degrees in electronics and\n communication engineering from Punjab Technical University, Punjab, India.

The results in this paper are more thorough and more aspects of task offloading have been analysed. For instance, the model is evaluated under two different resource augmentation environments for mobile cloud computing: a local private cloud and public clouds. More precisely, the task scheduling problem is optimally solved to minimize: (i) the total energy consumption when applied to a local private cloud, and (ii) the total energy consumption and monetary cost when applied to public clouds. Our proposed model at the centralized broker-node finds optimal solutions for task assignment problem, and provides a significant reduction in the total costs compared with the task assignment by the centralized scheduler without optimization.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Mobile handsets","Cloud computing","Computational modeling","Energy consumption","Mathematical model","Performance evaluation","Processor scheduling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","mobile computing","power aware computing","scheduling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mobile cloud computing","centralized broker-node","mobile devices","task scheduler model","energy optimization","centralized task scheduling problem","optimization process","economic element","task offloading","different resource augmentation environments","local private cloud","public clouds","total energy consumption","task assignment problem","centralized scheduler","monetary cost-aware mathematical task scheduler model"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Mobile cloud computing","cloud computing","task scheduler","computation offloading","resource augmentation"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7208816","doi":"10.1109/TCC.2015.2469665","startPage":"99","endPage":"113","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Cloud Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Cloud Computing","pdfPath":"/iel7/6245519/8307205/07208816.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8307205","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCC.2015.2469665","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 August 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7208816/","displayDocTitle":"Economic and Energy Considerations for Resource Augmentation in Mobile Cloud Computing","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.-March 1 2018","volume":"6","issue":"1","publicationDate":"1 Jan.-March 2018","dateOfInsertion":"06 March 2018","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"17633485","htmlLink":"/document/7208816/","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Economic and Energy Considerations for Resource Augmentation in Mobile Cloud Computing","sourcePdf":"tcc-nir-2469665-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.109381S","chronDate":"Jan.-March 1 2018","xplore-pub-id":"6245519","isNumber":"8307205","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6245519","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"8307205","articleId":"7208816","onlineDate":"18 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7208817,"authors":[{"name":"Zheng Yan","affiliation":["Department of Communications and Networking, Otakaari 5, Espoo, Finland","State Key Lab of Integrated Services Networks, Xidian University, Xi\u2019an, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6245519/8024042/7208817/yan-2469662-small.gif","p":["Zheng Yan (M\u201906-SM\u201914) received the BEng degree in\n electrical engineering and the MEng degree in computer science and engineering from the Xi\u2019an Jiaotong\n University, Xi\u2019an, China, in 1994 and 1997, respectively, the second MEng degree in information security from\n the National University of Singapore, Singapore, in 2000, and the licentiate of science and the doctor of science in\n technology in electrical engineering from Helsinki University of Technology, Helsinki, Finland, in 2005 and 2007,\n respectively.

Storing user data at a cloud data center greatly releases storage burden of user devices and brings access convenience. Due to distrust in cloud service providers, users generally store their crucial data in an encrypted form. But in many cases, the data need to be accessed by other entities for fulfilling an expected service, e.g., an eHealth service. How to control personal data access at cloud is a critical issue. Various application scenarios request flexible control on cloud data access based on data owner policies and application demands. Either data owners or some trusted third parties or both should flexibly participate in this control. However, existing work hasn't yet investigated an effective and flexible solution to satisfy this demand. On the other hand, trust plays an important role in data sharing. It helps overcoming uncertainty and avoiding potential risks. But literature still lacks a practical solution to control cloud data access based on trust and reputation. In this paper, we propose a scheme to control data access in cloud computing based on trust evaluated by the data owner and/or reputations generated by a number of reputation centers in a flexible manner by applying Attribue-Based Encryption and Proxy Re-Encryption. We integrate the concept of context-aware trust and reputation evaluation into a cryptographic system in order to support various control scenarios and strategies. The security and performance of our scheme are evaluated and justified through extensive analysis, security proof, comparison and implementation. The results show the efficiency, flexibility and effectiveness of our scheme for data access control in cloud computing.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7208817/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 August 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"July-Sept. 1 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","publicationDate":"1 July-Sept. 2017","accessionNumber":"17169228","htmlLink":"/document/7208817/","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"01 September 2017","volume":"5","issue":"3","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Flexible Data Access Control Based on Trust and Reputation in Cloud Computing","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"PhD","grantNumber":"JY0300130104"},{"fundingName":"Chinese Educational Ministry","grantNumber":"B08038"},{"fundingName":"Chinese Educational Ministry","grantNumber":"JY0600132901"},{"fundingName":"Shaanxi Province for excellent researchers","grantNumber":"680F1303"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002666","fundingName":"Aalto University"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Flexible Data Access Control Based on Trust and Reputation in Cloud Computing","sourcePdf":"tcc-yan-2469662-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.136999S","chronDate":"July-Sept. 1 2017","xplore-pub-id":"6245519","isNumber":"8024042","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6245519","citationCount":"27","xplore-issue":"8024042","articleId":"7208817","onlineDate":"18 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7208820,"authors":[{"name":"Chun Tung Chou","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Engineering, University of New South Wales, Sydney, NSW, Australia"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/7299336/7208820/chou-2469784_print-small.gif","p":["\nChun Tung Chou (M'88) received the B.A. degree in engineering science from the University of Oxford, U.K. and the Ph.D. degree in control engineering from the University of Cambridge, U.K. He is an Associate Professor at the School of Computer Science and Engineering, The University of New South Wales, Australia.

This paper assumes that the transmitter uses different chemical reactions to generate different emission patterns of signalling molecules to represent different transmission symbols, and the receiver consists of receptors. When the signalling molecules arrive at the receiver, they may react with the receptors to form ligand-receptor complexes. Our goal is to study the demodulation in this setup assuming that the transmitter and receiver are synchronised. We derive an optimal demodulator using the continuous history of the number of complexes at the receiver as the input to the demodulator. We do that by first deriving a communication model which includes the chemical reactions in the transmitter, diffusion in the transmission medium and the ligand-receptor process in the receiver. This model, which takes the form of a continuous-time Markov process, captures the noise in the receiver signal due to the stochastic nature of chemical reactions and diffusion. We then adopt a maximum a posteriori framework and use Bayesian filtering to derive the optimal demodulator. We use numerical examples to illustrate the properties of this optimal demodulator.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2015.2469784","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2015.2469784","startPage":"3728","endPage":"3743","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/7299336/07208820.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7299336","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Markovian Approach to the Optimal Demodulation of Diffusion-Based Molecular Communication Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7208820/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 August 2015","displayDocTitle":"A Markovian Approach to the Optimal Demodulation of Diffusion-Based Molecular Communication Networks","volume":"63","issue":"10","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"15 October 2015","accessionNumber":"15524630","publicationDate":"Oct. 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7208820/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Markovian Approach to the Optimal Demodulation of Diffusion-Based Molecular Communication Networks","sourcePdf":"tcomm-chou-2469784-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.150309S","chronDate":"Oct.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"7299336","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"39","xplore-issue":"7299336","articleId":"7208820","onlineDate":"18 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":7208821,"authors":[{"name":"Jiyan Wu","affiliation":["Engineering Product Development Pillar, Singapore University of Technology and Design, Singapore"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/7299336/7208821/wu-2469296-small.gif","p":["\n\nJiyan Wu (S'13\u2013M'15) received the bachelor's degree from North China Institute of Science and Technology, China, in 2008, the master's degree from China University of Mining and Technology, Beijing, China, in June 2011, and the Ph.D. degree in computer science and technology from the Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China, in June 2014.

To remedy the shortcomings of the data retransmission mechanism in TCP, forward error correction (FEC) coding is commonly used as the application-layer error-resilient scheme in live media streaming systems. An important measurement study reveals that TCP exhibits delay-friendliness (i.e., delay-performance bias) towards traffic flows composed of small-size packets. Motivated by leveraging the delay-friendliness of TCP to optimize the real-time streaming video quality, we propose a novel FEC coding scheme dubbed Coded Live vide OStreaming ov Er TCP (CLOSET). To achieve the optimal video quality over the lossy communication networks, we analytically formulate the constrained optimization problem of joint FEC coding and packet interleaving to minimize the effective packet loss rate. Then, we provide an approximate analysis to derive the solution for online adaption of FEC redundancy, packet size, and interleaving level. The performance of CLOSET is evaluated through extensive semi-physical emulations in Exata involving real-time encoded H.264 video streaming. Experimental results show that CLOSET outperforms the reference FEC coding schemes in terms of video peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), end-to-end delay, ratio of overdue video frames, and goodput. Therefore, we recommend CLOSET for TCP-based real-time video communication systems.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2015.2469296","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7299336","startPage":"3584","endPage":"3599","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/7299336/07208821.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Leveraging the Delay-Friendliness of TCP With FEC Coding in Real-Time Video Communication","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7208821/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 August 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7208821/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Leveraging the Delay-Friendliness of TCP With FEC Coding in Real-Time Video Communication","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2015","accessionNumber":"15524647","dateOfInsertion":"15 October 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"63","issue":"10","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001321","fundingName":"National Research Foundation"},{"fundingName":"Prime Minister's Office, Singapore"},{"fundingName":"IDM Futures Funding Initiative"},{"fundingName":"Interactive and Digital Media Programme Office"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Leveraging the Delay-Friendliness of TCP With FEC Coding in Real-Time Video Communication","sourcePdf":"tcomm-wu-2469296-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.109094S","chronDate":"Oct.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"7299336","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"7299336","articleId":"7208821","onlineDate":"18 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7208827,"authors":[{"name":"Hang Mu","affiliation":["Provincial Key Laboratory of Information Coding and Transmission, Southwest Jiaotong University, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Hang","lastName":"Mu","id":"37085614345"},{"name":"Zheng Ma","affiliation":["Provincial Key Laboratory of Information Coding and Transmission, Southwest Jiaotong University, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Zheng","lastName":"Ma","id":"37418488100"},{"name":"Mahamuda Alhaji","affiliation":["Provincial Key Laboratory of Information Coding and Transmission, Southwest Jiaotong University, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Mahamuda","lastName":"Alhaji","id":"37085625540"},{"name":"Pingzhi Fan","affiliation":["Provincial Key Laboratory of Information Coding and Transmission, Southwest Jiaotong University, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Pingzhi","lastName":"Fan","id":"37085344210"},{"name":"Dageng Chen","affiliation":["Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Dageng","lastName":"Chen","id":"37671147600"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2162-2337"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2162-2345"}],"articleNumber":"7208827","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":102,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":2955},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Detectors","Computational complexity","Bit error rate","Modulation","Sparse code multiple access","5G mobile communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["5G mobile communication","computational complexity","error statistics","message passing","modulation","multiuser detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["uplink SCMA system","fixed low complexity message pass algorithm detector","sparse code multiple access","nonorthogonal multiple access scheme","5G system","coded bit mapping","multidimensional sparse codeword","multiuser signal detection","high computational complexity","partial marginalization","bit error ratio performance degradation","BER performance degradation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["5G","partial marginalization","SCMA","MPA detector","sparse"]},{"kwd":["5G","partial marginalization","SCMA","MPA detector","sparse"]}],"abstract":"Sparse code multiple access (SCMA) is a new modulation and non-orthogonal multiple access scheme for 5G systems, in which the coded bits are mapped to multi-dimensional sparse codewords, and the message passing algorithm (MPA) is employed to detect multi-user signals.

In most cases, data providers have no/little control that has led to concern that the personal data may be beached. Microaggregation techniques seek to protect microdata in such a way that data can be published and mined without providing any private information that can be linked to specific individuals. An optimal microaggregation method must minimize the information loss resulting from this replacement process. The challenge is how to minimize the information loss during the microaggregation process. This paper presents a sorting framework for Statistical Disclosure Control (SDC) to protect microdata in cloud computing. It consists of two stages. In the first stage, an algorithm sorts all records in a data set in a particular way to ensure that during microaggregation very dissimilar observations are never entered into the same cluster. In the second stage a microaggregation method is used to create k-anonymous clusters while minimizing the information loss. The performance of the proposed techniques is compared against the most recent microaggregation methods. Experimental results using benchmark datasets show that the proposed algorithms perform significantly better than existing associate techniques in the literature.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Microaggregation Sorting Framework for K-Anonymity Statistical Disclosure Control in Cloud Computing","doi":"10.1109/TCC.2015.2469649","startPage":"408","endPage":"417","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCC.2015.2469649","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9109589","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Cloud Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Cloud Computing","pdfPath":"/iel7/6245519/9109589/07208829.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7208829","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 August 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7208829/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April-June 1 2020","displayDocTitle":"Microaggregation Sorting Framework for K-Anonymity Statistical Disclosure Control in Cloud Computing","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"8","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/7208829/","dateOfInsertion":"05 June 2020","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"1 April-June 2020","accessionNumber":"19761786","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Microaggregation Sorting Framework for K-Anonymity Statistical Disclosure Control in Cloud Computing","sourcePdf":"tcc-kabir-2469649-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.254239S","chronDate":"April-June 1 2020","xplore-pub-id":"6245519","isNumber":"9109589","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6245519","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"9109589","articleId":"7208829","onlineDate":"18 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2020","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7208830,"authors":[{"name":"Ronald L.

In this paper, we investigate the properties of spiral inductors with and without projected shielding, and compare the method with similar circuits including those with floating shields shaped as patterned ground shields. In addition, a measurement methodology for LC tank resonators is developed and presented. Test structures are implemented as microstrip spiral inductors and evaluated as LC tank circuits that resonate between 100 and 500 MHz. The Q values of shielded structures are up to 7% greater than those without shields, and area savings for LC resonators-compared with side-by-side layouts of L and C-are up to 35%.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Spirals","Inductors","Capacitance","Layout","RLC circuits","Metals","Strips"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electromagnetic shielding","energy conservation","inductors","integrated circuit layout","integrated circuit testing","LC circuits","low-power electronics","microwave integrated circuits","resonators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["microstrip spiral inductors","floating low-loss RF shields","LC tank circuits","energy efficiency","tank inductor","floating shields","patterned ground shields","LC tank resonators","frequency 100 MHz to 500 MHz"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Floating shield","LC resonator","projected shield","Q measurement","RLC circuits","shielding."]},{"kwd":["Floating shield","LC resonator","projected shield","Q measurement","RLC circuits","shielding"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TCPMT.2015.2457237","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Components, Packaging and Manufacturing Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Components, Packaging and Manufacturing Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/5503870/7272756/07208830.pdf","startPage":"1300","endPage":"1312","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7272756","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCPMT.2015.2457237","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Spiral Inductors With Floating Low-Loss RF Shields for - Resonator Applications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7208830","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Spiral Inductors With Floating Low-Loss RF Shields for <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$LC$ </tex-math></inline-formula> Resonator Applications","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7208830/","volume":"5","issue":"9","publicationDate":"Sept. 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7208830/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"15474816","dateOfInsertion":"21 September 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 August 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spiral Inductors With Floating Low-Loss RF Shields for <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$LC$ </tex-math></inline-formula> Resonator Applications","sourcePdf":"tcpmt-haner-2457237-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.114883S","chronDate":"Sept.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"5503870","isNumber":"7272756","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5503870","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7272756","articleId":"7208830","onlineDate":"18 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7208832,"authors":[{"name":"Sahar Molla Aghajanzadeh","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Waterloo, Waterloo, ON, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/7328780/7208832/molla-2469685_print-small.gif","p":["\nSahar Molla Aghajanzadeh received the B.Sc. and the M.Sc. degrees in electrical engineering from Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Iran, in 2003 and 2006, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from University of Waterloo, Waterloo, ON, Canada.

Simulation results are presented to illustrate the spectrum sensing performance of the proposed tests in comparison with existing detectors in literature such as the conventional energy detector, maximum eigenvalue-based detector and also to verify the analytical expressions derived for the detection performance.","doi":"10.1109/LWC.2015.2469777","publicationTitle":"IEEE Wireless Communications Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Wireless Communications Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/5962382/7358209/07208836.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LWC.2015.2469777","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7358209","startPage":"593","endPage":"596","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"GLRT Based Spectrum Sensing for MIMO SC-FDMA Cognitive Radio Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7208836","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"GLRT Based Spectrum Sensing for MIMO SC-FDMA Cognitive Radio Networks","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7208836/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 August 2015","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"4","issue":"6","publicationDate":"Dec. 2015","accessionNumber":"15677447","dateOfInsertion":"17 December 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7208836/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"GLRT Based Spectrum Sensing for MIMO SC-FDMA Cognitive Radio Networks","sourcePdf":"lwc-kumar-2469777-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.086336S","chronDate":"Dec.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"5962382","isNumber":"7358209","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5962382","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7358209","articleId":"7208836","onlineDate":"18 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7208838,"authors":[{"name":"Tofar C.-Y.

To improve performance and provide new BF decoder options for complexity-performance tradeoffs, we propose new designs for the flipping function (FF), the flipped bit selection (FBS) rule and the checksum weight updating schedule. The new FF adjusts the checksum weights in every iteration while our FBS rules take more information into account. These two modifications represent efforts to track more closely the evolutions of both check and variable nodes' reliabilities. Two selective update schedules are proposed to offer more performance and complexity tradeoffs. The combinations of the new FBS rule and known FFs result in new BF decoders with improved performance and a modest complexity increase. On the other hand, combining the new FF and FBS rule gives a new decoder with performance comparable to that of the normalized min-sum algorithm while if we use a much simpler FBS rule instead, the decoder suffers little performance loss with reduced complexity. We also present a simple decision-theoretical argument to justify the new checksum weight formula and a time-expanded factor graph model to explain the proposed selective weight-updating schedules.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2015.2469780","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/7328780/07208838.pdf","startPage":"3950","endPage":"3963","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7328780","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2015.2469780","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dynamic Weighted Bit-Flipping Decoding Algorithms for LDPC Codes","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7208838","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2015","displayDocTitle":"Dynamic Weighted Bit-Flipping Decoding Algorithms for LDPC Codes","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7208838/","publicationDate":"Nov. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"13 November 2015","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"15676739","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7208838/","volume":"63","issue":"11","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 August 2015","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004663","fundingName":"Taiwan's Ministry of Science and Technology","grantNumber":"NSC-100-2111-E-009-066-MY3"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamic Weighted Bit-Flipping Decoding Algorithms for LDPC Codes","sourcePdf":"tcomm-su-2469780-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.098989S","chronDate":"Nov.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"7328780","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"7328780","articleId":"7208838","onlineDate":"18 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7208841,"authors":[{"name":"Liang Liu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, National University of Singapore, Singapore"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/7328780/7208841/liu-2469687_print-small.gif","p":["\nLiang Liu (S'14\u2013M'15) received the B.Eng. degree from the Tianjin University, China, in 2010, and the Ph.D degree from the National University of Singapore, Singapore, in 2014.

To tackle this problem, extensive efforts have been devoted to design efficient signal quantization/compression techniques in the fronthaul to maximize the network throughput. However, most of the previous results are based on information-theoretical quantization methods, which are hard to implement practically due to the high complexity. In this paper, we propose using practical uniform scalar quantization in the uplink communication of an orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) based C-RAN system, where the mobile users are assigned with orthogonal sub-carriers for transmission. In particular, we study the joint wireless power control and fronthaul quantization design over the sub-carriers to maximize the system throughput. Efficient algorithms are proposed to solve the joint optimization problem when either information-theoretical or practical fronthaul quantization method is applied. We show that the fronthaul capacity constraints have significant impact to the optimal wireless power control policy. As a result, the joint optimization shows significant performance gain compared with optimizing only wireless power control or fronthaul quantization. Besides, we also show that the proposed simple uniform quantization scheme performs very close to the throughput performance upper bound, and in fact overlaps with the upper bound when the fronthaul capacity is sufficiently large. Overall, our results reveal practically achievable throughput performance of C-RAN for its efficient deployment in the next-generation wireless communication systems.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE

The impedance interaction between individually designed converters may make the cascaded system become unstable. The previous presented stabilization approaches not only need to know the information of the regulated converter, but also have to know the characteristics of the other converters in the system, which are contradictory to the modularization characteristic of dc DPS. This letter proposes an adaptive-input-impedance-regulation (AIIR) method, which connects an adaptive virtual impedance in parallel with the input impedance of the load converter, to stabilize the cascaded system. This virtual impedance can adaptively regulate its characteristic for different source converters. Therefore, with the AIIR method, all the load converters can be designed to a fixed standard module to stably adapt various source converters. In addition, at any cases, the AIIR approach only changes the load converter's input impedance in a very small frequency range to keep the load converter's original dynamic performance. The requirements on the AIIR method are derived and the control strategies to achieve the AIIR method are proposed. Finally, considering the worst stability problem that often occurs at the system whose source converter is an LC filter, a load converter cascaded with two different LC input filters is fabricated and tested to validate the effectiveness of the proposed AIIR control method.","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2015.2469720","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/63/7330074/07208845.pdf","startPage":"1826","endPage":"1832","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2015.2469720","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7330074","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Stabilization of a Cascaded DC Converter System via Adding a Virtual Adaptive Parallel Impedance to the Input of the Load Converter","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7208845","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 August 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7208845/","displayDocTitle":"Stabilization of a Cascaded DC Converter System via Adding a Virtual Adaptive Parallel Impedance to the Input of the Load Converter","volume":"31","issue":"3","publicationDate":"March 2016","accessionNumber":"15602491","isOpenAccess":true,"isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7208845/","dateOfInsertion":"17 November 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000266","fundingName":"Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council","grantNumber":"EP/I038586/1"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Stabilization of a Cascaded DC Converter System via Adding a Virtual Adaptive Parallel Impedance to the Input of the Load Converter","sourcePdf":"tpel-zhang-2469720-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.070179S","chronDate":"March  2016","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"7330074","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"52","xplore-issue":"7330074","articleId":"7208845","onlineDate":"18 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7208846,"authors":[{"name":"Lamiaa Khalid","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Ryerson University, Toronto, ON, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/7374774/7208846/khali-2469667-small.gif","p":["Lamiaa Khalid received the B.Sc. degree in electrical engineering from the Ain Shams University, Cairo, Egypt, and the M.Sc and Ph.D degrees in electrical engineering from the Ryerson University, Toronto, ON, Canada.

We employ a group-based cooperative spectrum sensing (CSS) scheme in which cooperating secondary users are grouped such that different groups are responsible for sensing different channels. In this group-based CSS scheme, channels sharing the same cooperating users are scheduled to sense in different sensing rounds. In this work, we propose adaptively assigning the heterogeneous cooperating secondary users to different groups to maximize the throughput efficiency while maintaining a predefined sensing accuracy. To this end, we analytically derive a closed-form expression for the throughput efficiency in terms of the average opportunistic throughput and average sensing overhead. We also formulate the throughput efficiency maximization problem for heterogeneous secondary users as a nonlinear binary programming problem, which is computationally intractable. We then propose three efficient adaptive assignment heuristics that perform the assignment of users to groups and the assignment of those groups to the sensing rounds such that the throughput efficiency is maximized. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed assignment heuristics can achieve near optimal performance with low computational complexity and can also improve the throughput efficiency significantly compared to the existing nonadaptive assignment and sequential CSS schemes.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2015.2469667","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7693/7374774/07208846.pdf","startPage":"232","endPage":"246","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2015.2469667","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7374774","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive Assignment of Heterogeneous Users for Group-Based Cooperative Spectrum Sensing","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7208846/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 August 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2016","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive Assignment of Heterogeneous Users for Group-Based Cooperative Spectrum Sensing","volume":"15","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2016","accessionNumber":"15697440","htmlLink":"/document/7208846/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"07 January 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"National Science and Engineering Research Council"},{"fundingName":"ENGAGE"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive Assignment of Heterogeneous Users for Group-Based Cooperative Spectrum Sensing","sourcePdf":"twc-anpalagan-2469667-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.091153S","chronDate":"Jan.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"7374774","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"7374774","articleId":"7208846","onlineDate":"18 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7208847,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaochen Xia","affiliation":["College of Communication Engieering, PLA University of Science and Technology"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/7323913/7208847/7208847-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Xiaochen Xia received his B.E. degree in electronic science and technology from Tianjin University in 2010, and M.S. degree in communication and information system from PLA University of Science and Technology (PLAUST), in 2013.

Different from the traditional MM-FDR protocol, a general model where sources/destinations are allowed to equip with multiple antennas is considered. In contrast to the conventional MIMO system, massive MIMO must be built with low-cost components which are prone to hardware impairments. In this paper, the effect of hardware impairments is taken into consideration, and is modeled using transmit-receive distortion noises. We propose a low complexity hardware impairments aware transceiver scheme (named as HIA scheme) to mitigate the distortion noises by exploiting the statistical knowledge of channels and antenna arrays at sources and destinations. A joint degree of freedom and power optimization algorithm is presented to further optimize the spectral efficiency of HIA based MM-FDR.

Instead, its robustness can be greatly improved with auxiliary information. Specifically, we jointly optimize landmark detection together with the recognition of heterogeneous but subtly correlated facial attributes, such as gender, expression, and appearance attributes. This is non-trivial since different attribute inference tasks have different learning difficulties and convergence rates. To address this problem, we formulate a novel tasks-constrained deep model, which not only learns the inter-task correlation but also employs dynamic task coefficients to facilitate the optimization convergence when learning multiple complex tasks. Extensive evaluations show that the proposed task-constrained learning (i) outperforms existing face alignment methods, especially in dealing with faces with severe occlusion and pose variation, and (ii) reduces model complexity drastically compared to the state-of-the-art methods based on cascaded deep model.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel7/34/7445283/07208848.pdf","startPage":"918","endPage":"930","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","doi":"10.1109/TPAMI.2015.2469286","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPAMI.2015.2469286","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7445283","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7208848","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Learning Deep Representation for Face Alignment with Auxiliary Attributes","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Face","Training","Convergence","Covariance matrices","Correlation","Gaussian distribution","Glass"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["convergence","correlation methods","face recognition","image representation","learning (artificial intelligence)","object detection","optimisation","pose estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["learning deep representation","face alignment","auxiliary attributes","landmark detection","auxiliary information","facial attributes","attribute inference task","task-constrained deep model","intertask correlation","dynamic task coefficients","optimization convergence","task-constrained learning","occlusion","pose variation","cascaded deep model"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Face Alignment","Face Landmark Detection","Deep Learning","Convolutional Network"]},{"kwd":["Face Alignment","face landmark detection","deep learning","convolutional network"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7208848/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1 2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 August 2015","displayDocTitle":"Learning Deep Representation for Face Alignment with Auxiliary Attributes","volume":"38","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/7208848/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"1 May 2016","accessionNumber":"15887574","pubMedId":"27046839","dateOfInsertion":"31 March 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Learning Deep Representation for Face Alignment with Auxiliary Attributes","sourcePdf":"tpami-zhang-2469286-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.160949S","chronDate":"May 1 2016","xplore-pub-id":"34","isNumber":"7445283","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"216","xplore-issue":"7445283","articleId":"7208848","onlineDate":"18 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7208849,"authors":[{"name":"Fernando Rosas","affiliation":["KU Leuven, Leuven, Belgium"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/7374774/7208849/rosas-2469289-small.gif","p":["Fernando Rosas (S\u201912\u2013M\u201913) received the B.Sc. degree in music composition and philosophy (Minor), the B.Sc. degree in mathematics, and the Ph.D. degree in engineering sciences from the Pontificia Universidad Cat\u00f3lica de Chile, Santiago, Chile, in 2003, 2007, and 2012, respectively.

Nevertheless, this reduction comes at the cost of extra energy consumption introduced by the added computational load. No complete analysis of the tradeoff between retransmissions reduction and baseband consumption of low-power communications over fading channels has been reported so far. In this paper, we study the energy efficiency achievable by HARQ schemes when the code rate of the error-correcting code is optimized. For this purpose, we develop an energy consumption model that focuses on simple HARQ (S-HARQ) and Chase combining (HARQ-CC) transmissions, which are studied under fast-fading and block-fading scenarios with Nakagami-m fading. The retransmission statistics are analyzed, and expressions for the expected number of transmission trials are derived. Using this framework, it is shown that transmission schemes with high diversity gain are the most efficient choice for long range transmissions, which in our case correspond to HARQ-CC and codes with low code rate. On the other hand, schemes with good multiplexing capabilities are optimal for short link distances, which in our analysis correspond to S-HARQ and high code rates. It is also shown that HARQ-CC can effectively extend the transmission range of a low-power communication device.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2015.2469289","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7693/7374774/07208849.pdf","startPage":"191","endPage":"205","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2015.2469289","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7374774","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimizing the Code Rate of Energy-Constrained Wireless Communications With HARQ","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7208849","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 August 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7208849/","displayDocTitle":"Optimizing the Code Rate of Energy-Constrained Wireless Communications With HARQ","volume":"15","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2016","accessionNumber":"15697422","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7208849/","dateOfInsertion":"07 January 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"CONICYT of Chile","grantNumber":"15110017 FONDAP 2011 and FONDEF IT13i20015"},{"fundingName":"CNPq of Brazil"},{"fundingName":"F+ fellowship from KU Leuven and the SBO"},{"fundingName":"Agency for Innovation by Science and Technology IWT of Belgium"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004234","fundingName":"Pontificia Universidad Cat\u00f3lica de Chile"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimizing the Code Rate of Energy-Constrained Wireless Communications With HARQ","sourcePdf":"twc-rosas-2469289-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.111227S","chronDate":"Jan.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"7374774","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"7374774","articleId":"7208849","onlineDate":"18 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7208851,"authors":[{"name":"Joseph M.

The approach uses multidimensional scaling to learn a common transformation matrix for the entire face which simultaneously transforms the facial features of the low resolution and the high resolution training images such that the distance between them approximates the distance had both the images been captured under the same controlled imaging conditions. Stereo matching cost is used to obtain the similarity of two images in the transformed space. Though this gives very good recognition performance, the time taken for computing the stereo matching cost is significant. To overcome this limitation, we propose a reference-based approach in which each face image is represented by its stereo matching cost from a few reference images.

Adaptive dynamic programming (ADP) is developed to obtain the optimal control under the worst case of the disturbance. Three single-layer neural networks, including one critic and two action networks, are employed to approximate the performance index function, the optimal control law, and the disturbance, respectively, for facilitating the implementation of the ADP method. Convergence properties of the ADP method are developed to show that the system state will converge to a finite neighborhood of the equilibrium. The weight matrices of the critic and the two action networks are also convergent to finite neighborhoods of their optimal ones.

However, there is still an unaddressed challenge: the application-specific dependability in terms of sensor fault detection and tolerance. The dependability is also affected by a reduction on the quality of monitoring when mitigating WSN constrains (e.g., limited energy, narrow bandwidth). We address these by designing a dependable distributed WSN framework for SHM (called DependSHM) and then examining its ability to cope with sensor faults and constraints. We find evidence that faulty sensors can corrupt results of a health event (e.g., damage) in a structural system without being detected. More specifically, we bring attention to an undiscovered yet interesting fact, i.e., the real measured signals introduced by one or more faulty sensors may cause an undamaged location to be identified as damaged (false positive) or a damaged location as undamaged (false negative) diagnosis. This can be caused by faults in sensor bonding, precision degradation, amplification gain, bias, drift, noise, and so forth. In DependSHM, we present a distributed automated algorithm to detect such types of faults, and we offer an online signal reconstruction algorithm to recover from the wrong diagnosis. Through comprehensive simulations and a WSN prototype system implementation, we evaluate the effectiveness of DependSHM.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dependable Structural Health Monitoring Using Wireless Sensor Networks","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Dependable and Secure Computing","doi":"10.1109/TDSC.2015.2469655","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Dependable and Secure Computing","pdfPath":"/iel7/8858/7971996/07208855.pdf","startPage":"363","endPage":"376","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TDSC.2015.2469655","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7971996","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7208855","chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/8858/7971996/7208855-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7208855/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 August 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"July-Aug. 1 2017","displayDocTitle":"Dependable Structural Health Monitoring Using Wireless Sensor Networks","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"14","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/7208855/","dateOfInsertion":"11 July 2017","publicationDate":"1 July-Aug. 2017","accessionNumber":"17013222","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002822","fundingName":"Central South University"},{"fundingName":"Postdoctoral research fund"},{"fundingName":"China postdoctoral research fund","grantNumber":"2015T80884"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100009847","fundingName":"Fordham University"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61632009, 61472451 and 61402543"},{"fundingName":"Higher Education in Guangdong Province","grantNumber":"2016ZJ01"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"NSF","grantNumber":"CNS 1449860, CNS 1461932, CNS 1460971, CNS 1439672, CNS 1301774, ECCS 1231461 and TII-15-1517"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","chorusFlag":"true","title":"Dependable Structural Health Monitoring Using Wireless Sensor Networks","sourcePdf":"tdsc-wang-2469655-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.129159S","chronDate":"July-Aug. 1 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8858","isNumber":"7971996","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8858","citationCount":"59","xplore-issue":"7971996","articleId":"7208855","onlineDate":"18 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7208857,"authors":[{"name":"Ron C.

Traditional data prefetching focuses on applications running on bare metal systems using hard drives. In contrast, virtualized systems using SSDs present different challenges for data prefetching. Most existing prefetching techniques, if applied unchanged in such environments, are likely to either fail to fully utilize SSDs, interfere with virtual machine I/O requests, or cause too much overhead if run in every virtualized instance.In this work, we demonstrate that data prefetching, when run in a virtualization-friendly manner can provide significant performance benefits for a wide range of data-intensive applications. We have designed and developed VIO-prefetching, consisting of accurate prediction of application needs in runtime and adaptive feedback-directed prefetching that scales with application needs, while being considerate to underlying storage devices and host systems. We have implemented a real system in Linux and evaluated it on different storage devices with the virtualization layer.Our comprehensive study provides insights of VIO-prefetching's behavior at various virtualization system configurations, e.g., the number of VMs, in-guest processes, application types, etc. The proposed method improves virtual I/O performance up to 43 percent with the average of 14 percent for 1 to 12 VMs while running various applications on a Xen virtualization system.","doi":"10.1109/TSC.2015.2469295","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Services Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Services Computing","pdfPath":"/iel7/4629386/7944974/07208857.pdf","startPage":"328","endPage":"340","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7944974","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSC.2015.2469295","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Adaptive IO Prefetching Approach for Virtualized Data Centers","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7208857","chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/4629386/7944974/7208857-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"May-June 1 2017","displayDocTitle":"An Adaptive IO Prefetching Approach for Virtualized Data Centers","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7208857/","publicationDate":"1 May-June 2017","dateOfInsertion":"09 June 2017","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"16948565","htmlLink":"/document/7208857/","volume":"10","issue":"3","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 August 2015","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"National Science Foundation CAREER","grantNumber":"CNS-1350766, IOS-1124813 and OCI-0937875"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","chorusFlag":"true","title":"An Adaptive IO Prefetching Approach for Virtualized Data Centers","sourcePdf":"tsc-chiang-2469295-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.133955S","chronDate":"May-June 1 2017","xplore-pub-id":"4629386","isNumber":"7944974","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4629386","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7944974","articleId":"7208857","onlineDate":"18 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":7208862,"authors":[{"name":"Hsien-Ping Lin","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of California at Davis, Davis, CA, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Hsien-Ping Lin received the B.S. degree from National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan, in 2008.

The performance of a polar code is characterized asymptotically in terms of the exponent of its kernel. The pioneering work of Ar\u0131kan on polar codes is based on a linear kernel of dimension two and exponent 0.5. In this paper, constructions of linear and nonlinear binary kernels of dimensions up to 16 are presented. The kernels are obtained using computer search or by shortening longer kernels obtained by computer search and a computer program is used to determine their exponents. It is proved that the constructed kernels have maximum exponents except in the case of nonlinear kernels of dimension 12 where it is demonstrated that the maximum exponent either equals that of the presented construction or assumes another specified value. The results show that the minimum dimension for which there exists a linear kernel with exponent greater than 0.5, i.e., exceeds the exponent of the linear kernel proposed by Ar\u0131kan, is 15, while this minimum dimension is 14 for nonlinear kernels. Furthermore, it is shown that there is a linear kernel with maximum exponent up to dimension 11. For dimensions 13, 14, 15, and 16, there are nonlinear kernels with exponents larger than any of that of a linear kernel. The kernels of these dimensions that have maximum exponent, although nonlinear over GF(2), are \u2124\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">4</sub>\n-linear or \u2124\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sub>\n\u2124\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">4</sub>\n-linear.","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2015.2469298","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel7/18/7258415/07208862.pdf","startPage":"5253","endPage":"5270","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2015.2469298","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7258415","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Linear and Nonlinear Binary Kernels of Polar Codes of Small Dimensions With Maximum Exponents","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 August 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7208862/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2015","displayDocTitle":"Linear and Nonlinear Binary Kernels of Polar Codes of Small Dimensions With Maximum Exponents","dateOfInsertion":"11 September 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7208862/","accessionNumber":"15439882","volume":"61","issue":"10","publicationDate":"Oct. 2015","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000143","fundingName":"National Science Foundation through the Division of Computing and Communication Foundations","grantNumber":"CCF-1015548"},{"fundingName":"SanDisk"},{"fundingName":"LSI Corporation"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100005014","fundingName":"Northrop Grumman"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Linear and Nonlinear Binary Kernels of Polar Codes of Small Dimensions With Maximum Exponents","sourcePdf":"tit-abdelghaffar-2469298-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.130005S","chronDate":"Oct.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"7258415","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"27","xplore-issue":"7258415","articleId":"7208862","onlineDate":"18 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7208864,"authors":[{"name":"Kuldeep Kulkarni","affiliation":["School of Arts, Media and Engineering and the School of Electrical, Computer and Energy Engineering, Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/34/7425337/7208864/kulka-small.gif","p":["Kuldeep Kulkarni received the BTech degree in electrical and\n electronics engineering from the National Institute of Technology Karnataka, Surathkal, India, in 2009, and the MS\n degree in electrical engineering from Arizona State University in 2012.

Compressive cameras have emerged as a potential solution to deal with the data deluge issues in such applications. However, inference tasks such as action recognition require high quality features which implies reconstructing the original video data. Much work in compressive sensing (CS) theory is geared towards solving the reconstruction problem, where state-of-the-art methods are computationally intensive and provide low-quality results at high compression rates. Thus, reconstruction-free methods for inference are much desired. In this paper, we propose reconstruction-free methods for action recognition from compressive cameras at high compression ratios of 100 and above. Recognizing actions directly from CS measurements requires features which are mostly nonlinear and thus not easily applicable. This leads us to search for such properties that are preserved in compressive measurements. To this end, we propose the use of spatio-temporal smashed filters, which are compressive domain versions of pixel-domain matched filters. We conduct experiments on publicly available databases and show that one can obtain recognition rates that are comparable to the oracle method in uncompressed setup, even for high compression ratios.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"April 1 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7208864/","volume":"38","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/7208864/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"1 April 2016","accessionNumber":"15823534","pubMedId":"26353363","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"03 March 2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 August 2015","displayDocTitle":"Reconstruction-Free Action Inference from Compressive Imagers","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000006","fundingName":"ONR","grantNumber":"N00014-12-1-0124 and Z868302"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reconstruction-Free Action Inference from Compressive Imagers","sourcePdf":"tpami-kulkarni-2469288-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.092398S","chronDate":"April 1 2016","xplore-pub-id":"34","isNumber":"7425337","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"38","xplore-issue":"7425337","articleId":"7208864","onlineDate":"18 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7208873,"authors":[{"name":"Dalei Wu","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Tennessee at Chattanooga, Chattanooga, TN, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/9424/7442910/7208873/dalwu-2469636-small.gif","p":["Dalei Wu (M\u201910) received the B.S. and M.Eng. degrees in electrical engineering from Shandong University, Jinan, China, in 2001 and 2004, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree in computer engineering from the University of Nebraska\u2013Lincoln, Lincoln, NE, USA, in 2010.","Prior to joining the University of Tennessee at Chattanooga (UTC), Chattanooga, TN, USA, he was a Postdoctoral Research Associate with the Mechatronics Research Laboratory, Department of Mechanical Engineering, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, USA.

Such networks are comprised of sensor nodes (SNs) and relay nodes (RNs) carried by robots for information sensing and communication, and are able to perform accurate and realtime inspection, especially in adverse environments. SN localization is critical in such networks because localization results can be used not only for locating and pinpointing leaks, but also for maneuvering mobile SNs in a pipeline of complex configuration. However, both the underground operational environment and the limited resources of the SNs pose significant challenges for SN localization. This paper presents algorithms for SN localization in robotic sensor networks for underground pipeline inspection. Specifically, self-localization of underground in-pipe SNs were investigated by taking into account SN movement dynamics, and using the measurements of the SN's velocity and the received signal strength (RSS) of the radio signal from aboveground RNs. Depending on the availability of the RSS at the SN, different localization algorithms based on the Kalman filter are proposed for different scenarios. Simulation results show the efficacy of the proposed algorithms. The framework also provides insight into the design of robotic sensor networks for the inspection and maintenance of other types of pipeline systems, such as oil and gas pipelines.","doi":"10.1109/TII.2015.2469636","startPage":"809","endPage":"819","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TII.2015.2469636","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7442910","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics","pdfPath":"/iel7/9424/7442910/07208873.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Node Localization in Robotic Sensor Networks for Pipeline Inspection","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7208873/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Node Localization in Robotic Sensor Networks for Pipeline Inspection","volume":"12","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/7208873/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"15901991","publicationDate":"April 2016","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 August 2015","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004055","fundingName":"King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals in Dhahran, Saudi Arabia"},{"fundingName":"Center for Clean Water and Clean Energy at MIT and KFUPM","grantNumber":"R7-DMN-08"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Node Localization in Robotic Sensor Networks for Pipeline Inspection","sourcePdf":"tii-wu-2469636-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.067802S","chronDate":"April  2016","xplore-pub-id":"9424","isNumber":"7442910","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9424","citationCount":"58","xplore-issue":"7442910","articleId":"7208873","onlineDate":"18 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":7208880,"authors":[{"name":"Zhiyong Wang","affiliation":["Department of Nanomedicine and Biomedical Engineering, Institute of Molecular Medicine, Houston, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Zhiyong","lastName":"Wang","id":"37085709020"},{"name":"Hao Ding","affiliation":["Department of Nanomedicine and Biomedical Engineering, Institute of Molecular Medicine, Houston, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Hao","lastName":"Ding","id":"37085719423"},{"name":"Guijin Lu","affiliation":["Department of Nanomedicine and Biomedical Engineering, Institute of Molecular Medicine, Houston, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Guijin","lastName":"Lu","id":"37085709460"},{"name":"Xiaohong Bi","affiliation":["Department of Nanomedicine and Biomedical Engineering, Institute of Molecular Medicine, Houston, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Xiaohong","lastName":"Bi","id":"37085705187"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0278-0062"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-254X"}],"articleNumber":"7208880","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":13,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":2602},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society","url":"http://www.embs.org"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.ieee.org/organizations/society/sp/index.html"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Nuclear and Plasma Sciences Society","url":"http://www.ewh.ieee.org/soc/nps/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control Society","url":"http://www.ieee-uffc.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Receivers","Optical imaging","Spatial resolution","Biomedical optical imaging","Mathematical model","Optical filters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biological tissues","biomedical optical imaging","image reconstruction","medical image processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["reverse-time migration","optical structure reconstruction","image reconstruction","wave propagation","forward modeling","reverse-time extrapolation","acoustic seismic waves","optical RTM imaging method","image quality","low-wavenumber artifact","LWA suppression","Laplacian filtering","illumination normalization","tissue layer"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Biomedical optical imaging","image processing","optical tomography","time-resolved imaging","tomographic reconstruction"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Algorithms","Brain","DNA","Humans","Image Processing, Computer-Assisted","Models, Biological","Optical Imaging","Phantoms, Imaging"]}],"abstract":"We theoretically demonstrated a new optical imaging technique based on reverse-time migration (RTM) for reconstructing optical structures in homogeneous media for the first time. RTM is a powerful wave-equation-based method to reconstruct the image of the structure by modeling the wave propagation inside the media with both forward modeling and reverse-time extrapolation. While RTM is commonly used with acoustic seismic waves, this paper represents the first effort to develop optical RTM imaging method for biomedical research. To refine the image quality, we further developed new methods to suppress the low-wavenumber artifact (LWA). When compared with the conventional means for LWA suppression such as Laplacian filtering, illumination normalization, and the ratio method, our new derivative-based and power-image methods are able to significantly reduce LWA, resulting in high-quality reconstructed images with sufficient contrasts and spatial resolutions for structure identification. The optical RTM imaging technique may provide a new platform for non-invasive optical imaging of structures in deep layers of tissues for biomedical applications.","doi":"10.1109/TMI.2015.2469598","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","pdfPath":"/iel7/42/7368217/07208880.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7368217","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMI.2015.2469598","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","startPage":"273","endPage":"281","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reverse-Time Migration Based Optical Imaging","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7208880","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 August 2015","displayDocTitle":"Reverse-Time Migration Based Optical Imaging","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7208880/","volume":"35","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/7208880/","isJournal":true,"isOpenAccess":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2016","accessionNumber":"15685076","pubMedId":"26292337","dateOfInsertion":"29 December 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Reverse-Time Migration Based Optical Imaging","sourcePdf":"tmi-wang-2469598-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.090105S","chronDate":"Jan.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"42","isNumber":"7368217","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"42","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"7368217","articleId":"7208880","onlineDate":"18 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7208881,"authors":[{"name":"Kin-Chu Ho","affiliation":["Department of Electronics Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/92/7436835/7208881/ho-2464092-small.gif","p":["Kin-Chu Ho received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in electronics engineering from National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan, in 2008 and 2010, respectively, where he is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree in electronics engineering.","His current research interests include VLSI design and implementation for error control codes, and signal processing algorithm for storage system."]},"firstName":"Kin-Chu","lastName":"Ho","id":"37085541157"},{"name":"Chih-Lung Chen","affiliation":["Department of Electronics Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/92/7436835/7208881/chen-2464092-small.gif","p":["Chih-Lung Chen received the B.S., M.S., and Ph.D. degrees from National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan, in 2004, 2006, and 2012, respectively, all in electronics engineering.","His current research interests include VLSI implementation of error control codes and wireless communication systems."]},"firstName":"Chih-Lung","lastName":"Chen","id":"37293076300"},{"name":"Hsie-Chia Chang","affiliation":["Department of Electronics Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/92/7436835/7208881/chang-2464092-small.gif","p":["Hsie-Chia Chang received the B.S., M.S., and Ph.D. degrees from National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan, in 1995, 1997, and 2002, respectively, all in electronics engineering.","He was with OSP/DE1, MediaTek Corporation, Taipei, Taiwan, from 2002 to 2003, where he was involved in decoding architectures for combo single chip.

In this paper, a top-down design methodology, which not only goes through code construction and optimization, but also hardware implementation to meet all the critical requirements, is presented. A two-step array dispersion algorithm is proposed to construct long LDPC codes with a small submatrix size. Then, the constructed LDPC code is optimized by masking matrix to obtain better bit-error rate (BER) performance and lower error-floor. In addition, our LDPC codes have a diagonal-like structure in the parity-check matrix leading to a proposed hybrid storage architecture, which has the advantages of better area efficiency and large enough data bandwidth for high decoding throughput. To be adopted for NAND flash applications, an (18900, 17010) LDPC code with a code-rate of 0.9 and submatrix size of 63 is constructed and the field-programmable gate array simulations show that the error floor is successfully suppressed down to BER of 10\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">-12</sup>\n.

This MMSE-based optimization leads to a highly nonlinear objective function of sources and relaying precoders under power constraints so that an iterative search algorithm is applied to explore the optimal power allocation. Simulation results show that the SVD-based joint design of relay and source precoders, in conjunction with the SVD-based relay-and-antenna selection scheme, is capable of achieving superior performance in terms of bit error rate (BER) with an alleviated demand on relays and associated antenna pairs.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/25/7513343/07208893.pdf","startPage":"4854","endPage":"4864","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2015.2469727","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2015.2469727","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7513343","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7208893","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint Relay/Antenna Selection and Precoding Design for Two-Way MIMO Amplify-and-Forward Relaying Systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Relays","MIMO","Joints","Optimization","Covariance matrices","Transmitting antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["amplify and forward communication","error statistics","fading channels","iterative methods","least mean squares methods","MIMO communication","relay networks (telecommunication)","search problems","singular value decomposition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["joint relay-antenna selection and precoding design","two-way MIMO AF relaying systems","dual-hop two-way amplify-and-forward multiple-input-multiple-output relaying system","singular value decomposition technique","SVD technique","correlated fading channels","two-source transceivers","multirelay precoders","minimum-mean-square-error criterion","MMSE-based optimization","iterative search algorithm","bit error rate","BER"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Amplify and forward (AF)","correlated channel","minimum mean square error (MMSE)","multiple-input\u2013multiple-output (MIMO)","precoder","relay-and-antenna selection","singular value decomposition (SVD)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7208893/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 August 2015","displayDocTitle":"Joint Relay/Antenna Selection and Precoding Design for Two-Way MIMO Amplify-and-Forward Relaying Systems","volume":"65","issue":"7","htmlLink":"/document/7208893/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2016","accessionNumber":"16141196","dateOfInsertion":"14 July 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint Relay/Antenna Selection and Precoding Design for Two-Way MIMO Amplify-and-Forward Relaying Systems","sourcePdf":"tvt-hu-2469727-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.106067S","chronDate":"July  2016","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"7513343","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"7513343","articleId":"7208893","onlineDate":"18 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7208894,"authors":[{"name":"Siheng Chen","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/7323913/7208894/7208894-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Siheng Chen (S\u201913) received his B.Eng. degree in optoelectronics engineering in 2011 from Beijing Institute of Technology and the M.S. degree in electrical and computer engineering in 2012 from Carnegie Mellon University.

The theory follows the same paradigm as classical sampling theory. We show that perfect recovery is possible for graph signals bandlimited under the graph Fourier transform. The sampled signal coefficients form a new graph signal, whose corresponding graph structure preserves the first-order difference of the original graph signal. For general graphs, an optimal sampling operator based on experimentally designed sampling is proposed to guarantee perfect recovery and robustness to noise; for graphs whose graph Fourier transforms are frames with maximal robustness to erasures as well as for Erd\u00f6s-R\u00e9nyi graphs, random sampling leads to perfect recovery with high probability. We further establish the connection to the sampling theory of finite discrete-time signal processing and previous work on signal recovery on graphs. To handle full-band graph signals, we propose a graph filter bank based on sampling theory on graphs. Finally, we apply the proposed sampling theory to semi-supervised classification of online blogs and digit images, where we achieve similar or better performance with fewer labeled samples compared to previous work.","chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/78/7323913/7208894-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7208894/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 August 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.15,  2015","volume":"63","issue":"24","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"15587685","dateOfInsertion":"10 November 2015","publicationDate":"Dec.15, 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7208894/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Discrete Signal Processing on Graphs: Sampling Theory<?Pub _newline=\"\"?>","openAccessFlag":"F","chorusFlag":"true","title":"Discrete Signal Processing on Graphs: Sampling Theory<?Pub _newline=\"\"?>","sourcePdf":"tsp-kovacevic-2469645-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.216404S","chronDate":"Dec.15,  2015","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"7323913","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"315","xplore-issue":"7323913","articleId":"7208894","onlineDate":"18 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7208895,"authors":[{"name":"Thomas Moon","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/7323913/7208895/7208895-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Thomas Moon (S\u201914\u2013M\u201914) received the B.S. degree in electrical electronic engineering from Pohang University of Science and Technology (POSTECH), Pohang, Korea, in 2008, and the M.S. degree in electrical and computer engineering from Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, in 2012, where he is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree.

The proposed architecture employs a combination of dual-rate time-interleaved undersampling hardware and associated multicoset back-end signal processing algorithms. In dual-rate sampling hardware, a pair of uniform samplers is used to acquire a common incoming wideband sparse signal while the operation frequencies of the two samplers have a small frequency offset. Due to the sampling frequency offset, the time grids of the samples obtained from the two samplers are irregularly spaced. These nonuniform periodic samples are then digitally re-sequenced and applied as input to a multicoset signal reconstruction algorithm. The multicoset signal reconstruction algorithm uses the re-sequenced nonuniform periodic samples to achieve a perfect reconstruction of the original wideband signal with an enhanced time resolution beyond the sampling hardware's capability. Compared to the conventional multi-channel sampling approach commonly used with multicoset algorithms, the proposed method uses fewer sampling channels and does not require their accurate clock phase adjustment.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7323913","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2015.2469648","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/78/7323913/07208895.pdf","startPage":"6486","endPage":"6497","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2015.2469648","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Wideband Sparse Signal Acquisition With Dual-rate Time-Interleaved Undersampling Hardware and Multicoset Signal Reconstruction Algorithms","chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/78/7323913/7208895-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.15,  2015","displayDocTitle":"Wideband Sparse Signal Acquisition With Dual-rate Time-Interleaved Undersampling Hardware and Multicoset Signal Reconstruction Algorithms","volume":"63","issue":"24","htmlLink":"/document/7208895/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec.15, 2015","accessionNumber":"15587683","dateOfInsertion":"10 November 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7208895/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 August 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","chorusFlag":"true","title":"Wideband Sparse Signal Acquisition With Dual-rate Time-Interleaved Undersampling Hardware and Multicoset Signal Reconstruction Algorithms","sourcePdf":"tsp-moon-2469648-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.070783S","chronDate":"Dec.15,  2015","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"7323913","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"7323913","articleId":"7208895","onlineDate":"18 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7208896,"authors":[{"name":"Hooman Farkhani","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Ferdowsi University of Mashhad, Mashhad, Iran"],"firstName":"Hooman","lastName":"Farkhani","id":"37085391145"},{"name":"Ali Peiravi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Ferdowsi University of Mashhad, Mashhad, Iran"],"firstName":"Ali","lastName":"Peiravi","id":"37425877500"},{"name":"Farshad Moradi","affiliation":["Integrated Circuits and Electronics Laboratory, Aarhus University, Aarhus, Denmark"],"firstName":"Farshad","lastName":"Moradi","id":"37408663500"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-8210"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9999"}],"articleNumber":"7208896","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":10,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":483},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Circuits and Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieee-cas.org/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computer Society","url":"http://www.computer.org/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Solid-State Circuits Society","url":"http://www.sscs.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7208896","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Transistors","Leakage currents","Writing","Magnetic tunneling","Mathematical model","Integrated circuit reliability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS memory circuits","magnetic tunnelling","random-access storage"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["boosted wordline technique","CMOS","symmetric write operation","spin-torque transfer memory bitcell","magnetic tunnel junction","write characteristics","write assist technique","negative bitline technique","1T-1MTJ STT-RAM bitcells","low-energy write operation","size 65 nm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["CMOS","magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ)","spin-torque transfer memory (STT-RAM)","symmetric write."]},{"kwd":["CMOS","magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ)","spin-torque transfer memory (STT-RAM)","symmetric write"]}],"abstract":"In this brief, a new write assist technique is proposed to improve the write characteristics of 1T-1 magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ) spin-torque transfer memory bitcell through a symmetric write operation.

Our idea is motivated by the key observations that rich traffic demand information already exists in the log and meta-data files of many big data applications, and that such information can be readily extracted through run-time file system monitoring. As the first step, we use Hadoop as a concrete example to explore our methodology and develop a system called HadoopWatch to predict traffic demands of Hadoop applications. We further implement HadoopWatch in a small-scale testbed with 10 physical servers and 30 virtual machines. Our experiments over a series of MapReduce applications demonstrate that HadoopWatch can forecast the traffic demand with almost 100% accuracy and time advance. Furthermore, it makes no modification on the Hadoop framework, and introduces little overhead to the application performance. Finally, to showcase the utility of accurate traffic prediction made by HadoopWatch, we design and implement a simple HadoopWatch-enabled network optimization module into the HadoopWatch controller, and with realistic Hadoop job benchmarks we find that even a simple algorithm can leverage the forecasting results provided by HadoopWatch to significantly improve the Hadoop job completion time by up to 14.72%.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking","pdfPath":"/iel7/90/7544544/07208904.pdf","startPage":"2210","endPage":"2222","publicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking","doi":"10.1109/TNET.2015.2458892","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNET.2015.2458892","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7544544","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7208904","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Towards Comprehensive Traffic Forecasting in Cloud Computing: Design and Application","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Forecasting","Monitoring","Big data","Computer architecture","Writing","IEEE transactions","Concrete"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Big Data","cloud computing","file servers","meta data","parallel processing","system monitoring","telecommunication traffic","virtual machines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["comprehensive traffic forecasting","cloud computing","Big Data applications","light-weighted file system monitoring","meta-data files","log files","information extraction","run-time file system monitoring","traffic demand prediction","physical servers","virtual machines","MapReduce applications","traffic demand forecasting","Hadoop framework","HadoopWatch-enabled network optimization module","HadoopWatch controller","Hadoop job completion time"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cloud computing","data center networks","traffic prediction","Hadoop"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7208904/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 August 2015","displayDocTitle":"Towards Comprehensive Traffic Forecasting in Cloud Computing: Design and Application","volume":"24","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/7208904/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2016","accessionNumber":"16231756","dateOfInsertion":"16 August 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Towards Comprehensive Traffic Forecasting in Cloud Computing: Design and Application","sourcePdf":"tnet-chen-2458892-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.166301S","chronDate":"Aug.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"90","isNumber":"7544544","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"90","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"7544544","articleId":"7208904","onlineDate":"18 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7208906,"authors":[{"name":"Kewei Qian","affiliation":["Shenzhen Engineering Laboratory of Wireless Locating Technology and System, The Chinese University of Hong Kong"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/22/7287831/7208906/7208906-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Kewei Qian was born in Chongqing, China, in 1981.

This \u201cone-fit-all\u201d feature allows for decoupling a wide range of coupled antennas with different form factors for a given frequency band. To prove the concept, two LTCC CRDNs for decoupling different forms of antennas working in the 2.45-GHz band are designed, fabricated, and tested. Measurement results have demonstrated that significant improvement in isolation can be achieved within a wide operating frequency range in all cases. The presented design theory and circuit topology are general and can be applied to both symmetric and asymmetric two-element antenna arrays.","doi":"10.1109/TMTT.2015.2464816","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel7/22/7287831/07208906.pdf","startPage":"3199","endPage":"3207","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMTT.2015.2464816","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7287831","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An LTCC Coupled Resonator Decoupling Network for Two Antennas","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7208906","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 August 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7208906/","displayDocTitle":"An LTCC Coupled Resonator Decoupling Network for Two Antennas","volume":"63","issue":"10","publicationDate":"Oct. 2015","accessionNumber":"15488874","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7208906/","dateOfInsertion":"02 October 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An LTCC Coupled Resonator Decoupling Network for Two Antennas","sourcePdf":"tmtt-wu-2464816-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.065315S","chronDate":"Oct.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"22","isNumber":"7287831","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"27","xplore-issue":"7287831","articleId":"7208906","onlineDate":"18 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7208909,"authors":[{"name":"Carlos H.

The use of on-chip DACs and ADCs enables multiple chips to interact via incoming and outgoing molecular digital data packets and thus create scalable biochemical reaction networks. The use of off-chip digital processors and on-chip digital memory enables programmable connectivity and parameter storage. We show that published static and dynamic MATLAB models of synthetic biological circuits including repressilators, feed-forward loops, and feedback oscillators are in excellent quantitative agreement with those from transistor circuits on the chip. Computationally intensive stochastic Gillespie simulations of molecular production are also rapidly reproduced by the chip and can be reliably tuned over the range of signal-to-noise ratios observed in biological cells.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/4156126/7274217/07208911.pdf","startPage":"527","endPage":"542","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Circuits and Systems","doi":"10.1109/TBCAS.2015.2446431","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TBCAS.2015.2446431","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7274217","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7208911","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Cytomorphic Chip for Quantitative Modeling of Fundamental Bio-Molecular Circuits","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Integrated circuit modeling","Biological system modeling","DNA","Stochastic processes","Transistors","MATLAB","Substrates"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["BiCMOS digital integrated circuits","biochemistry","biomolecular electronics","cellular biophysics","DNA","feedback oscillators","feedforward","lab-on-a-chip","molecular biophysics","proteins","RNA"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fundamental biomolecular circuits","BiCMOS silicon chip","log-domain cytomorphic transistor equivalents","biochemical binding","variable Hill-coefficient operation","DNA binding","probabilistic gene transcription","mRNA variables","protein variables","tunable stochastic transistor circuits","on-chip DAC","on-chip ADC","molecular digital data packets","biochemical reaction networks","off-chip digital processors","on-chip digital memory","static MATLAB models","dynamic MATLAB models","synthetic biological circuits","feed-forward loops","feedback oscillators","stochastic Gillespie simulations","biological cells","size 0.35 mum"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cytomorphic","molecular circuits","quantitative cellular models","reaction networks","stochastic simulation","synthetic biology","systems biology","transistor models"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Automatic Data Processing","Lab-On-A-Chip Devices","Microarray Analysis","Models, Theoretical"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7208911/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 August 2015","displayDocTitle":"A Cytomorphic Chip for Quantitative Modeling of Fundamental Bio-Molecular Circuits","volume":"9","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/7208911/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2015","accessionNumber":"15474757","pubMedId":"26292344","dateOfInsertion":"23 September 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Cytomorphic Chip for Quantitative Modeling of Fundamental Bio-Molecular Circuits","sourcePdf":"tbcas-woo-2446431-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.105049S","chronDate":"Aug.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"4156126","isNumber":"7274217","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4156126","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"7274217","articleId":"7208911","onlineDate":"18 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7208998,"authors":[{"name":"Seshanna Katam","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, National Institute of Technology (NIT), Tiruchirappalli, India"],"firstName":"Seshanna","lastName":"Katam","id":"37085384963"},{"name":"P.

It involves two methods, first the time domain signal from the Resource Block is combined linearly using pre-coding weights which is transparent to the receiver side.

Just like OFDM, the inter carrier interference (ICI) caused due to Carrier frequency offset (CFO) results in significant performance degradation of SCOFDM. The common technique employed in cancelling CFO is estimating the parameter with the help of pilot sequence and then cancelling its effect at the receiver. Such strategy results in loss of data rate and reduction in bandwidth efficiency. Also the performance is far away from ideal (no CFO) case. An analysis of the effect of CFO on the performance of SCOFDM system is presented in this paper and using the results of analysis, an interference cancellation technique utilizing the properties SCOFDM is proposed. The proposed scheme ensures interference free performance at the cost of slight increase in receiver complexity. The proposed scheme have high bandwidth efficiency since it does not use any pilot symbols for CFO estimation. The performance of the system is analysed and compared with the existing schemes.

OFDM is wireless communication technique in which digital data is encoded in large number of closely spaced orthogonal sub-carrier signals. The paper discusses the Baseband FPGA implementation of an OFDM transmitter. The module is implemented using a technique called partial reconfiguration so that the user can swap between different modulation schemes, coding methods and number sub-carriers needed in minimum time. In this implementation the user can switch between four OFDM transmitters in less than a minute without disturbing the normal working of the system. In this PR based implementation of OFDM Transmitter a larger part of the Modulator, coding and IFFT modules will be static and a smaller part will be dynamic. During swapping only the dynamic part of the FPGA is reconfigured in minimum which will reduce power and configuration time.","doi":"10.1109/Eco-friendly.2014.61","publicationTitle":"2014 3rd International Conference on Eco-friendly Computing and Communication Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 3rd International Conference on Eco-friendly Computing and Communication Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/7051380/7208942/07209005.pdf","startPage":"266","endPage":"270","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/Eco-friendly.2014.61","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7208942","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An OFDM Transmitter Implementation Using Cordic Based Partially Reconfigurable IFFT Module","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7209005","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 Dec. 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7209005/","displayDocTitle":"An OFDM Transmitter Implementation Using Cordic Based Partially Reconfigurable IFFT Module","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2014","accessionNumber":"15399501","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7209005/","conferenceDate":"18-21 Dec. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"20 August 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An OFDM Transmitter Implementation Using Cordic Based Partially Reconfigurable IFFT Module","confLoc":"Mangalore, India","sourcePdf":"7002a266.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061181S","chronDate":"18-21 Dec. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"7051380","isNumber":"7208942","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7051380","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7208942","articleId":"7209005","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7209082,"authors":[{"name":"A.

Multimedia sharing and Image/Video capturing are amongst the most utilized functionalities of smartphones. Smartphones and Internet availability made the capture, transmission and storage of digital data very easy and convenient. The simplicity, connectivity, and strong capabilities of such devices make it very hard to protect the privacy and Intellectual Property (IP) of digital multimedia. While all types of digital multimedia are at risk, digital images are severely affected. Editing and converting digital images can be done quite easily, and hence protecting them becomes even harder. Digital image watermarking is a technique used to authenticate and protect the IP of digital images. In this paper we propose an efficient and flexible digital watermarking system that runs on Android devices. The system uses RAW images (a feature of the most recent Android software, called Lollipop) to embed a watermark at an early stage before any modification and conversion of the image. The system incorporates public-key cryptography for increased protection. A simple and robust watermarking technique is utilized for efficiency. Other watermarking techniques are offered for flexibility. Finally, the system uses the inherent features of the Android operating system to run in parallel and be available to other applications.","publicationTitle":"2015 2nd World Symposium on Web Applications and Networking (WSWAN)","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doi":"10.1109/WSWAN.2015.7209088","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WSWAN.2015.7209088","pdfPath":"/iel7/7175889/7209078/07209088.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 2nd World Symposium on Web Applications and Networking (WSWAN)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7209078","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Developing an efficient digital image watermarking for smartphones","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7209088/","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"21-23 March 2015","conferenceDate":"21-23 March 2015","displayDocTitle":"Developing an efficient digital image watermarking for smartphones","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"20 August 2015","publicationDate":"March 2015","accessionNumber":"15384122","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7209088/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Developing an efficient digital image watermarking for smartphones","confLoc":"Sousse, Tunisia","sourcePdf":"DevelopinganEfficientDigitalImageWatermarking.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070793S","chronDate":"21-23 March 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7175889","isNumber":"7209078","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7175889","xplore-issue":"7209078","articleId":"7209088","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"}]
