Large vocabularies introduce difficulties involving the amount of computation the system must perform and the number of ambiguities it must resolve. But, for practical applications in general and for dictation tasks in particular, large vocabularies are required, because of the difficulties and inconveniences involved in restricting the speaker to the use of a limited vocabulary. This paper describes a new organization of the recognition process, Multilevel Decoding (MLD), that allows the system to support a Very-Large-Size Dictionary (VLSD)\u2014one comprising over 100,000 words. This significantly surpasses the capacity of previous speech-recognition systems. With MLD, the effect of dictionary size on the accuracy of recognition can be studied. In this paper, recognition experiments using 10,000- and 200,000-word dictionaries are compared. They indicate that recognition using a 200,000-word dictionary is more accurate than recognition using a 10,000-word dictionary (when unrecognized words are included in the error rate).","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IBM","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1988","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5390054/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1988","volume":"32","issue":"2","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 1988","dateOfInsertion":"06 April 2010","displayDocTitle":"Multilevel decoding for Very-Large-Size-Dictionary speech recognition","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multilevel decoding for Very-Large-Size-Dictionary speech recognition","sourcePdf":"ibmrd3202G.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.01609S","chronDate":"March  1988","isNumber":"5390048","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5288520","citationCount":"8","articleId":"5390054","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1988","subType":"IBM","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":5390074,"authors":[{"name":"C.

Until now, it has been believed that correlations of this type were not accounted for in existing yield models. It is shown in this paper that such correlations are present in yield models based on mixed or compound Poisson statistics. A quadrat analysis of particle distributions on semiconductor wafers is used to compare data and theory. The results show that the theoretical correlation coefficients are in agreement with the experimental ones. It was also determined from the particle data how these correlation coefficients vary as the distance between quadrats is increased. This variation provides a convenient method for determining the cluster dimensions.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IBM","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov.  1987","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  1987","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5390074/","volume":"31","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 1987","dateOfInsertion":"06 April 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Correlation analysis of particle clusters on integrated circuit wafers","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Correlation analysis of particle clusters on integrated circuit wafers","sourcePdf":"ibmrd3106F.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.013361S","chronDate":"Nov.  1987","isNumber":"5390069","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5288520","citationCount":"33","articleId":"5390074","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1987","subType":"IBM","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5390092,"authors":[{"name":"F.

The new method can be implemented off line but also can be made sufficiently efficient to be implemented with a microprocessor for use in self-optimizing (adaptive) channel detection circuitry.","doi":"10.1147/rd.303.0310","publicationTitle":"IBM Journal of Research and Development","displayPublicationTitle":"IBM Journal of Research and Development","pdfPath":"/iel5/5288520/5390172/05390179.pdf","startPage":"310","endPage":"320","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1147/rd.303.0310","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5390172","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Least-squares storage-channel identification","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5390179","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IBM","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May  1986","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  1986","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5390179/","displayDocTitle":"Least-squares storage-channel identification","volume":"30","issue":"3","publicationDate":"May 1986","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 April 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Least-squares storage-channel identification","sourcePdf":"ibmrd3003R.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.014661S","chronDate":"May  1986","isNumber":"5390172","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5288520","citationCount":"29","articleId":"5390179","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1986","subType":"IBM","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5390181,"authors":[{"name":"C.

The spatial distributions of particles on semiconductor wafers have been analyzed to gain insight into the nature of integrated circuit defect statistics. The analysis was done using grids of squares known as quadrats. It was found that the cluster parameter, which until now has been treated as a constant, did vary with quadrat area. The results also show that the deviation from Poisson statistics continues to increase into the realm of wafer-scale integration or WSI. Computer simulations were used to verify this effect.","doi":"10.1147/rd.303.0326","publicationTitle":"IBM Journal of Research and Development","displayPublicationTitle":"IBM Journal of Research and Development","pdfPath":"/iel5/5288520/5390172/05390181.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1147/rd.303.0326","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5390172","startPage":"326","endPage":"338","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On yield, fault distributions, and clustering of particles","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5390181","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IBM","displayDocTitle":"On yield, fault distributions, and clustering of particles","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  1986","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5390181/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May  1986","isJournal":true,"volume":"30","issue":"3","publicationDate":"May 1986","dateOfInsertion":"06 April 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On yield, fault distributions, and clustering of particles","sourcePdf":"ibmrd3003T.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.014136S","chronDate":"May  1986","isNumber":"5390172","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5288520","citationCount":"100","articleId":"5390181","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1986","subType":"IBM","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5390203,"authors":[{"name":"Jean Fargues","affiliation":["Scientific Center, IBM France, Paris, France"],"firstName":"Jean","lastName":"Fargues","id":"38109572800"},{"name":"Marie-Claude Landau","affiliation":["Scientific Center, IBM France, Paris, France"],"firstName":"Marie-Claude","lastName":"Landau","id":"38111563600"},{"name":"Anne Dugourd","affiliation":["Scientific Center, IBM France, Paris, France"],"firstName":"Anne","lastName":"Dugourd","id":"38109573100"},{"name":"Laurent Catach","affiliation":["Artificial Intelligence Department, Paris VI University, Paris, France"],"firstName":"Laurent","lastName":"Catach","id":"38109573400"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-8646"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"0018-8646"}],"articleNumber":"5390203","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":52},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IBM","url":"http://www.research.ibm.com/journal/staff.html"}],"doi":"10.1147/rd.301.0070","publicationTitle":"IBM Journal of Research and Development","displayPublicationTitle":"IBM Journal of Research and Development","pdfPath":"/iel5/5288520/5390197/05390203.pdf","startPage":"70","endPage":"79","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5390197","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1147/rd.301.0070","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5390203","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Conceptual graphs for semantics and knowledge processing","abstract":"This paper discusses the representational and algorithmic power of the conceptual graph model for natural language semantics and knowledge processing.

Redundancy is applied to two interleaved sets of nine tracks in the same proportion as that in the previous IBM 3420 tape machines. The coding structure, however, is simpler, for it avoids the complex computations of Galois fields. The coding structure is based on a concept of interacting vertical and cross-parity checks, where the cross-parity checks span both sets of tracks and are used in either set in an adaptive manner. As a result, the overall error-correcting capability is substantially improved without increasing the redundancy. Decoding, in which simple parity equations are processed, is designed to progress iteratively. By means of adaptive use of redundancy, the new method corrects up to three known erroneous tracks in any one set of nine tracks and up to four known erroneous tracks in the two sets together. The code also identifies the first unknown erroneous track in each of the two sets, and subsequently identifies the second unknown erroneous track in one of the two sets while providing correction for all these tracks. The result is generalized for a system with any number of tracks divided into a multiple number of unequal sets.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5390233","publicationTitle":"IBM Journal of Research and Development","displayPublicationTitle":"IBM Journal of Research and Development","pdfPath":"/iel5/5288520/5390233/05390234.pdf","doi":"10.1147/rd.296.0546","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1147/rd.296.0546","startPage":"546","endPage":"562","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive cross-parity (AXP) code for a high-density magnetic tape subsystem","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IBM","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov.  1985","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  1985","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5390234/","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive cross-parity (AXP) code for a high-density magnetic tape subsystem","isJournal":true,"volume":"29","issue":"6","dateOfInsertion":"06 April 2010","publicationDate":"Nov. 1985","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive cross-parity (AXP) code for a high-density magnetic tape subsystem","sourcePdf":"ibmrd2906B.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.029864S","chronDate":"Nov.  1985","isNumber":"5390233","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5288520","citationCount":"12","articleId":"5390234","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1985","subType":"IBM","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5390235,"authors":[{"name":"Richard C.

Compensation on the write side has, for the most part, been limited to moving transition locations to offset read-signal peak shifts. This paper presents a new method of equalization on the write side through the addition of pulses at strategic locations on the write waveform. The resulting write current continues to be a two-level signal, so ac bias is not required. A linear transfer function can be derived for these write equalizers. This enables the recording-channel designer to partition the equalization more optimally between the write and read sides. The principal benefit of write equalization is that the read-flux-amplitude differences between high and low densities are significantly reduced. This permits maximum use of the linear operating region of the magnetoresistive read head. By providing high-frequency boosts on the write side, write equalization can reduce high-frequency noises at the read detector. Test results of channel linearity, as well as read signal waveshapes, are presented.","publicationTitle":"IBM Journal of Research and Development","displayPublicationTitle":"IBM Journal of Research and Development","pdfPath":"/iel5/5288520/5390233/05390235.pdf","startPage":"563","endPage":"568","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1147/rd.296.0563","doi":"10.1147/rd.296.0563","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5390233","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Write equalization in high-linear-density magnetic recording","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IBM","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov.  1985","displayDocTitle":"Write equalization in high-linear-density magnetic recording","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5390235/","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 April 2010","publicationDate":"Nov. 1985","volume":"29","issue":"6","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  1985","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Write equalization in high-linear-density magnetic recording","sourcePdf":"ibmrd2906C.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.023788S","chronDate":"Nov.  1985","isNumber":"5390233","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5288520","citationCount":"37","articleId":"5390235","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1985","subType":"IBM","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5390236,"authors":[{"name":"P.

A finite-element algorithm is described which simulates the capacitance of structures with general shape in two or three dimensions. Efficient solution of the linear equations is provided by the incomplete Cholesky conjugate gradient method. The model is used to simulate the wiring capacitance of a 1.25-micrometer VLSI technology. The predicted capacitances of closely spaced first-metal polycide-gate and second-metal conductors used in this technology agree with measured results. The simulated three-dimensional capacitance of a second-metal line crossing a first-metal line is twice that found when estimated by two-dimensional models. The effect of line-to-line capacitance on the noise margin of logic circuits and on the signal in a dynamic RAM is examined. This capacitance presents a limit to wiring density for logic circuits and is a significant signal detractor in dynamic RAMs with closely spaced metal or diffused bit lines.","doi":"10.1147/rd.293.0277","publicationTitle":"IBM Journal of Research and Development","displayPublicationTitle":"IBM Journal of Research and Development","pdfPath":"/iel5/5288520/5390243/05390249.pdf","startPage":"277","endPage":"288","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1147/rd.293.0277","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5390243","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"VLSI wiring capacitance","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5390249","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IBM","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May  1985","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  1985","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5390249/","displayDocTitle":"VLSI wiring capacitance","volume":"29","issue":"3","publicationDate":"May 1985","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 April 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"VLSI wiring capacitance","sourcePdf":"ibmrd2903G.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.014523S","chronDate":"May  1985","isNumber":"5390243","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5288520","citationCount":"46","articleId":"5390249","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1985","subType":"IBM","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5390259,"authors":[{"name":"Russell H.

Instructions have a single format and contain an operand, index control bits, and two independent operation codes called \u201ctransfer\u201d code and \u201ccompute\u201d code. The first code specifies the transfer of a data word over the common data bus, e.g., from data memory to a local register. The second determines an operation of the ALU on the contents of local registers. A fast free-running multiplier operates in parallel with the ALU and delivers a product in every cycle with a pipeline delay of two cycles. The architecture allows transversal-filter operations to be performed with one multiplication and ALU operation in every cycle. This is accomplished by a novel interleaving technique called ZIP-ing. The efficiency of the processor is demonstrated by programming examples.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IBM","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1985","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5390281/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1985","volume":"29","issue":"2","publicationDate":"March 1985","dateOfInsertion":"06 April 2010","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Architecture of a digital signal processor","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Architecture of a digital signal processor","sourcePdf":"ibmrd2902C.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.015764S","chronDate":"March  1985","isNumber":"5390279","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5288520","citationCount":"12","articleId":"5390281","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1985","subType":"IBM","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5390282,"authors":[{"name":"Jean Paul Beraud","affiliation":["IBM France, B.P. 58, 91102 Corbeil-Essonnes, Cedex, France"],"firstName":"Jean Paul","lastName":"Beraud"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-8646"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"0018-8646"}],"articleNumber":"5390282","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":10,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":25},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IBM","url":"http://www.research.ibm.com/journal/staff.html"}],"abstract":"Very large microprocessors can now be integrated on a single chip; the integration eliminates packaging delays and is especially attractive for performance-oriented processors such as signal processors.

We provide a cost-effective approach to the following two problems: (1) to reduce the number of coding parameters to describe a distribution when several contexts are involved, and (2) to choose contexts for which variations in prediction error distributions are expected. We solve Problem 1 (distribution description) by a partition of the range of values of the outcomes into equivalence classes, called buckets. The result is a special decomposition of the error range. Cost-effectiveness is achieved by using the many contexts only to predict the bucket (equivalence class) probabilities. The probabilities of the value within the bucket are assumed to be independent of the context, thus enormously reducing the number of coding parameters involved. We solve Problem 2 (economical contexts) by using the buckets of the surrounding pixels as components of the conditioning class. The bucket values have the desirable properties needed for the error distributions.","displayPublicationTitle":"IBM Journal of Research and Development","pdfPath":"/iel5/5288520/5390279/05390287.pdf","startPage":"188","endPage":"193","publicationTitle":"IBM Journal of Research and Development","doi":"10.1147/rd.292.0188","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1147/rd.292.0188","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5390279","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5390287","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Parameter reduction and context selection for compression of gray-scale images","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IBM","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5390287/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1985","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1985","displayDocTitle":"Parameter reduction and context selection for compression of gray-scale images","volume":"29","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 1985","dateOfInsertion":"06 April 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Parameter reduction and context selection for compression of gray-scale images","sourcePdf":"ibmrd2902I.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.053388S","chronDate":"March  1985","isNumber":"5390279","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5288520","citationCount":"44","articleId":"5390287","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1985","subType":"IBM","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5390295,"authors":[{"name":"John A.

A simple analysis is carried out on the basis of linear acoustics which is in good agreement with the experimental observations.","displayPublicationTitle":"IBM Journal of Research and Development","pdfPath":"/iel5/5288520/5390326/05390339.pdf","startPage":"314","endPage":"321","publicationTitle":"IBM Journal of Research and Development","doi":"10.1147/rd.283.0314","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1147/rd.283.0314","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5390326","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5390339","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Experimental and Theoretical Study of Wave Propagation Phenomena in Drop-on-Demand Ink Jet Devices","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IBM","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5390339/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  1984","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May  1984","displayDocTitle":"Experimental and Theoretical Study of Wave Propagation Phenomena in Drop-on-Demand Ink Jet Devices","volume":"28","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May 1984","dateOfInsertion":"06 April 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Experimental and Theoretical Study of Wave Propagation Phenomena in Drop-on-Demand Ink Jet Devices","sourcePdf":"bogy.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.023998S","chronDate":"May  1984","isNumber":"5390326","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5288520","citationCount":"24","articleId":"5390339","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1984","subType":"IBM","lastupdate":"2021-10-22"},{"_id":5390340,"authors":[{"name":"J.

The coding algorithm is symbolwise recursive; i.e., it operates upon and encodes (decodes) one data symbol per iteration or recursion. On each recursion, the algorithm successively partitions an interval of the number line between 0 and 1, and retains one of the partitions as the new interval. Thus, the algorithm successively deals with smaller intervals, and the code string, viewed as a magnitude, lies in each of the nested intervals. The data string is recovered by using magnitude comparisons on the code string to recreate how the encoder must have successively partitioned and retained each nested subinterval. Arithmetic coding differs considerably from the more familiar compression coding techniques, such as prefix (Huffman) codes. Also, it should not be confused with error control coding, whose object is to detect and correct errors in computer operations. This paper presents the key notions of arithmetic compression coding by means of simple examples.","doi":"10.1147/rd.282.0135","publicationTitle":"IBM Journal of Research and Development","displayPublicationTitle":"IBM Journal of Research and Development","pdfPath":"/iel5/5288520/5390374/05390377.pdf","startPage":"135","endPage":"149","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1147/rd.282.0135","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5390374","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5390377","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Introduction to Arithmetic Coding","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IBM","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1984","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1984","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5390377/","displayDocTitle":"An Introduction to Arithmetic Coding","volume":"28","issue":"2","publicationDate":"March 1984","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 April 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Introduction to Arithmetic Coding","sourcePdf":"ibmrd2802C.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.026994S","chronDate":"March  1984","isNumber":"5390374","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5288520","citationCount":"162","articleId":"5390377","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1984","subType":"IBM","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5390378,"authors":[{"name":"Richard E.

This paper is concerned with the problem that arises when this is to be done simultaneously with respect to a number of outputs, using a single test set. More specifically, in this paper we describe an iterative procedure for generating a test set consisting of n-dimensional vectors which exhaustively covers all k-subspaces simultaneously, i.e., the projections of n-dimensional vectors in the test set onto any input subset of a specified size k contain all possible patterns of k-tuples. For any given k, we first find an appropriate N (N>k) and generate an efficient N-dimensional test set for exhaustive coverage of all k-subspaces. We next develop a constructive procedure to expand the corresponding test matrix (formed by taking test vectors as its rows) such that a test set of N\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n-dimensional vectors exhaustively covering the same k-subspaces is obtained. This procedure may be repeated to cover arbitrarily large n (equation after i iterations), while keeping the same k. It is shown that the size of the test set obtained this way grows in size which becomes proportional to (log n) raised to the power of [log (q+1)], where q is a function of k only, and is approximated (bounded closely below) by k\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n/4 in binary cases.

The maximum run length is 5 and the maximum digital sum variation is 6. A single error in the encoded bits can, at most, generate an error burst of length 5 in the decoded domain. A very simple implementation of the code has been accomplished by partitioning the coder into 5B/6B and 3B/4B subordinate coders.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5390389","publicationTitle":"IBM Journal of Research and Development","displayPublicationTitle":"IBM Journal of Research and Development","pdfPath":"/iel5/5288520/5390389/05390392.pdf","doi":"10.1147/rd.275.0440","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1147/rd.275.0440","startPage":"440","endPage":"451","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A DC-Balanced, Partitioned-Block, 8B/10B Transmission Code","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IBM","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  1983","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  1983","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5390392/","displayDocTitle":"A DC-Balanced, Partitioned-Block, 8B/10B Transmission Code","isJournal":true,"volume":"27","issue":"5","dateOfInsertion":"06 April 2010","publicationDate":"Sept. 1983","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A DC-Balanced, Partitioned-Block, 8B/10B Transmission Code","sourcePdf":"ibmrd2705D.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.017233S","chronDate":"Sept.  1983","isNumber":"5390389","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5288520","citationCount":"227","articleId":"5390392","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1983","subType":"IBM","lastupdate":"2021-10-09"},{"_id":5390403,"authors":[{"name":"C.

The creation of a binary representation from an analog image requires such algorithms to determine whether a point is converted into a binary one because it falls within a character stroke or a binary zero because it does not. This thresholding is a critical step in Optical Character Recognition (OCR). It is also essential for other Character Image Extraction (CIE) applications, such as the processing of machine-printed or handwritten characters from carbon copy forms or bank checks, where smudges and scenic backgrounds, for example, may have to be suppressed. The first algorithm, a nonlinear, adaptive procedure, is implemented with a minimum of hardware and is intended for many CIE applications. The second is a more aggressive approach directed toward specialized, high-volume applications which justify extra complexity.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1147/rd.274.0400","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5390426","publicationTitle":"IBM Journal of Research and Development","displayPublicationTitle":"IBM Journal of Research and Development","pdfPath":"/iel5/5288520/5390426/05390437.pdf","endPage":"411","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Image Thresholding for Optical Character Recognition and Other Applications Requiring Character Image Extraction","doi":"10.1147/rd.274.0400","startPage":"400","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5390437","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IBM","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  1983","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"July  1983","displayDocTitle":"Image Thresholding for Optical Character Recognition and Other Applications Requiring Character Image Extraction","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5390437/","dateOfInsertion":"06 April 2010","publicationDate":"July 1983","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"27","issue":"4","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Image Thresholding for Optical Character Recognition and Other Applications Requiring Character Image Extraction","sourcePdf":"ibmrd2704Y.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.04014S","chronDate":"July  1983","isNumber":"5390426","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5288520","citationCount":"52","articleId":"5390437","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1983","subType":"IBM","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":5390486,"authors":[{"name":"K.

Several critical functions have been investigated and the technical approaches are discussed. The first is the segmentation and classification of digitized printed documents into regions of text and images. A nonlinear, run-length smoothing algorithm has been used for this purpose. By using the regular features of text lines, a linear adaptive classification scheme discriminates text regions from others. The second technique studied is an adaptive approach to the recognition of the hundreds of font styles and sizes that can occur on printed documents. A preclassifier is constructed during the input process and used to speed up a well-known pattern-matching method for clustering characters from an arbitrary print source into a small sample of prototypes.

The thermal conduction module (TCM) utilizes a 90 \u00d7 90-mm MLC substrate to interconnect up to 118 LSI devices. The substrate, which typically contains 130 m of impedance-controlled wiring, provides an array of 121 pads for solder connections to each device and an array of 1800 pins for interconnection with the next-level package. A unique thermal design provides a cooling capacity of up to 300 W. This paper describes the TCM design and outlines the processes for fabrication of these modules. The TCM is compared to prior technologies to illustrate the improvements in packaging density, reliability, and performance.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IBM","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan  1982","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan  1982","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5390541/","volume":"26","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan 1982","dateOfInsertion":"06 April 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Thermal Conduction Module: A High-Performance Multilayer Ceramic Package","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Thermal Conduction Module: A High-Performance Multilayer Ceramic Package","sourcePdf":"ibmrd2601E.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.013718S","chronDate":"Jan  1982","isNumber":"5390537","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5288520","citationCount":"71","articleId":"5390541","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1982","subType":"IBM","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5390548,"authors":[{"name":"Robert.

The program is effective for large machines because, in part, the running time is proportional to the number of circuits. This is in contrast to alternative techniques such as delay simulation, which requires large numbers of test patterns, and path tracing, which requires tracing of all paths. The output of Timing Analysis includes \u201cslack\u201d at each block to provide a measure of the severity of any timing problem. The program also generates standard deviations for the times so that a statistical timing design can be produced rather than a worst case approach. This system has successfully detected all but a few timing problems for the IBM 3081 Processor Unit (consisting of almost 800,000 circuits) prior to the hardware debugging of timing. The 3081 is characterized by a tight statistical timing design.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Timing Analysis of Computer Hardware","publicationTitle":"IBM Journal of Research and Development","doi":"10.1147/rd.261.0100","displayPublicationTitle":"IBM Journal of Research and Development","pdfPath":"/iel5/5288520/5390537/05390548.pdf","startPage":"100","endPage":"105","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1147/rd.261.0100","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5390537","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5390548","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IBM","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5390548/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan  1982","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan  1982","displayDocTitle":"Timing Analysis of Computer Hardware","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"26","issue":"1","dateOfInsertion":"06 April 2010","publicationDate":"Jan 1982","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Timing Analysis of Computer Hardware","sourcePdf":"ibmrd2601L.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.023583S","chronDate":"Jan  1982","isNumber":"5390537","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5288520","citationCount":"156","articleId":"5390548","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1982","subType":"IBM","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5390549,"authors":[{"name":"Gordon L.

A new concept of contact hole personalization is introduced and is shown to be an efficient approach to masterslice design as well as a factor in achieving high cell density. Due to the unusual structure of the basic cell and the arrangement of the cells in the masterslice, a new physical design methodology was developed for the design of different part numbers, corresponding to unique logic functions, on this masterslice. The STL circuit operates with a 1.7-V power supply and yields a typical delay of 3 ns at 0.5 mW and 5 ns at 0.15 mW. The I/O circuits are TTL-level compatible. The cells, the circuits, the unique features of the masterslice, and its application in an I/O controller chip are described.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A High-Density Bipolar Logic Masterslice for Small Systems","publicationTitle":"IBM Journal of Research and Development","doi":"10.1147/rd.252.0142","displayPublicationTitle":"IBM Journal of Research and Development","pdfPath":"/iel5/5288520/5390630/05390636.pdf","startPage":"142","endPage":"151","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1147/rd.252.0142","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5390630","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5390636","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IBM","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5390636/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1981","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1981","displayDocTitle":"A High-Density Bipolar Logic Masterslice for Small Systems","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"25","issue":"3","dateOfInsertion":"06 April 2010","publicationDate":"March 1981","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A High-Density Bipolar Logic Masterslice for Small Systems","sourcePdf":"ibmrd2502a3G.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.02006S","chronDate":"March  1981","isNumber":"5390630","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5288520","citationCount":"3","articleId":"5390636","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1981","subType":"IBM","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5390637,"authors":[{"name":"W.

At the same time, the cost of engineering changes has made the correctness of chip implementations more important, and minimization of circuit count less so. These factors underscore the need for increased automation of logic design. This paper describes an experimental system for synthesizing synchronous combinational logic. It allows a designer to start with a naive implementation produced automatically from a functional specification, evaluate it with respect to these many factors, and incrementally improve this implementation by applying local transformations until it is acceptable for manufacture. The use of simple local transformations in this system ensures correct implementations, isolates technology-specific data, and will allow the total process to be applied to larger, VLSI designs. The system has been used to synthesize masterslice chip implementations from functional specifications, and to remap implemented masterslice chips from one technology to another while preserving their functional behavior.","doi":"10.1147/rd.254.0272","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1147/rd.254.0272","publicationTitle":"IBM Journal of Research and Development","displayPublicationTitle":"IBM Journal of Research and Development","pdfPath":"/iel5/5288520/5390646/05390651.pdf","startPage":"272","endPage":"280","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5390646","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Logic Synthesis Through Local Transformations","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IBM","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5390651/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  1981","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"July  1981","displayDocTitle":"Logic Synthesis Through Local Transformations","volume":"25","issue":"4","dateOfInsertion":"06 April 2010","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"July 1981","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Logic Synthesis Through Local Transformations","sourcePdf":"ibmrd2504F.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.031896S","chronDate":"July  1981","isNumber":"5390646","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5288520","citationCount":"72","articleId":"5390651","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1981","subType":"IBM","lastupdate":"2021-09-28"},{"_id":5390680,"authors":[{"name":"A.

Films of Pb-In(12 wt%)-Au(4 wt%) alloy (200\u2013800 nm thick) are used for forming junction base electrodes, interferometer controls, and interconnection lines. Tunnel barriers are formed on the base electrode films by thermal oxidation and subsequent sputter-etching in an rf-oxygen plasma.

In this paper it is shown that an overall system approach based on error-correcting codes and system maintenance strategy will reduce the main memory failure rate at the system level as if the alpha-particle problem had not occurred. This system solution is designed to be compatible with most existing memory designs so that there should be minimal additional cost for implementing it. The procedure described herein uses the capability of a single-error-correcting and double-error-detecting code to detect one hard and one soft error; then a microcode and hardware algorithm performs the correction of both errors. Results of both analytical and simulation modeling of the method and its comparison with other techniques are also included.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IBM","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May  1980","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  1980","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5390754/","volume":"24","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May 1980","dateOfInsertion":"06 April 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A System Solution to the Memory Soft Error Problem","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A System Solution to the Memory Soft Error Problem","sourcePdf":"ibmrd2403P.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.031747S","chronDate":"May  1980","isNumber":"5390739","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5288520","citationCount":"14","articleId":"5390754","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1980","subType":"IBM","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5390755,"authors":[{"name":"C.

The mixing process requires two parameters which are readily obtained from product data. The product is described in the model by critical areas which depend on the circuit's sensitivity to defects, and they can be determined in a systematic way. The process is represented in the model by defect densities and gross yield losses. These are measured with defect monitors independently of product type. This paper shows how the yield for any product can be calculated given the critical areas, defect density, and mixing parameter. Future yields are forecast by using expected improvements in defect densities. Examples show good agreement between actual and calculated yields.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Yield Model for Productivity Optimization of VLSI Memory Chips with Redundancy and Partially Good Product","doi":"10.1147/rd.243.0398","startPage":"398","endPage":"409","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1147/rd.243.0398","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5390739","publicationTitle":"IBM Journal of Research and Development","displayPublicationTitle":"IBM Journal of Research and Development","pdfPath":"/iel5/5288520/5390739/05390755.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5390755","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IBM","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May  1980","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5390755/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  1980","displayDocTitle":"Yield Model for Productivity Optimization of VLSI Memory Chips with Redundancy and Partially Good Product","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"24","issue":"3","dateOfInsertion":"06 April 2010","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May 1980","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Yield Model for Productivity Optimization of VLSI Memory Chips with Redundancy and Partially Good Product","sourcePdf":"ibmrd2403Q.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.021794S","chronDate":"May  1980","isNumber":"5390739","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5288520","citationCount":"150","articleId":"5390755","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1980","subType":"IBM","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5390761,"authors":[{"name":"Albert E.

In particular, the use of a single-element rotary read-write head imposes new demands in the areas of data encoding and error recovery. This paper presents a comprehensive scheme for error recovery for the 3850 MSS which features a new error-correction code in a serial, single-stripe data format. The recovery procedure is designed around resynchronizable sections of data which are rendered independent of each other in error modes through the use of zero-modulation encoding and self-contained error-detection pointers. These error-detection pointers and the resynchronization signals are utilized in conjunction with interleaved codewords of the error-correction code. The code is designed with a generating polynomial in which the roots are chosen from the set of elements of a 16-element subfield of the Galois field GF(2\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">8</sup>\n). This choice provides the necessary code structure for desired code capabilities and facilitates fast decoding of errors with an economical implementation of the decoder. The scheme provides correction capabilities for various combinations of mixed-mode short and long errors common to magnetic tape recording of digital data.","doi":"10.1147/rd.241.0032","publicationTitle":"IBM Journal of Research and Development","displayPublicationTitle":"IBM Journal of Research and Development","pdfPath":"/iel5/5288520/5390775/05390779.pdf","startPage":"32","endPage":"42","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1147/rd.241.0032","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5390775","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Error Recovery Scheme for the IBM 3850 Mass Storage System","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IBM","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5390779/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  1980","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  1980","displayDocTitle":"Error Recovery Scheme for the IBM 3850 Mass Storage System","volume":"24","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 1980","dateOfInsertion":"06 April 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Error Recovery Scheme for the IBM 3850 Mass Storage System","sourcePdf":"ibmrd2401E.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.011198S","chronDate":"Jan.  1980","isNumber":"5390775","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5288520","citationCount":"7","articleId":"5390779","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1980","subType":"IBM","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5390782,"authors":[{"name":"Shu Lin","affiliation":["University of Hawaii, Manoa"],"firstName":"Shu","lastName":"Lin","id":"37276533700"},{"name":"George Markowsky","affiliation":["IBM Thomas J.

For these reasons, majority-logic decodable cyclic codes are very suitable for error control in high speed digital data transmission systems. Among the majority-logic decodable codes, the one-step decodable codes can be most easily implemented; they employ a single majority-logic gate. In this paper we study a class of one-step majority-logic decodable cyclic codes. First, we describe these codes in a simple manner. Second, a way of finding the orthogonal polynomials for decoding these codes is presented.

The database designer can take advantage of this equivalence to reduce problems of interest to him to simpler problems in propositional logic. A detailed algorithm is presented for such an application. Two proofs of the equivalence are presented: a \u201csyntactic\u201d proof and a \u201csemantic\u201d proof. The syntactic proof proceeds in several steps. It is shown that 1) Armstrong's Dependency Axioms are complete for dependency statements in the usual logical sense that they are strong enough to prove every consequence, and that 2) Armstrong's Axioms are also complete for implicational statements in propositional logic. The equivalence then follows from 1) and 2). The other proof proceeds by considering appropriate semantic interpretations for the propositional variables. The Delobel\u2013Casey Relational Database Decomposition Theorems, which heretofore have seemed somewhat fortuitous, are immediate and natural corollaries of the equivalence. Furthermore, a counterexample is demonstrated, which shows that what seems to be a mild extension of the equivalence fails.","doi":"10.1147/rd.216.0534","publicationTitle":"IBM Journal of Research and Development","displayPublicationTitle":"IBM Journal of Research and Development","pdfPath":"/iel5/5288520/5390955/05390961.pdf","startPage":"534","endPage":"544","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1147/rd.216.0534","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5390955","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Functional Dependencies in a Relational Database and Propositional Logic","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5390961","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IBM","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov.  1977","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  1977","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5390961/","displayDocTitle":"Functional Dependencies in a Relational Database and Propositional Logic","volume":"21","issue":"6","publicationDate":"Nov. 1977","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 April 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Functional Dependencies in a Relational Database and Propositional Logic","promoFlag":"true","sourcePdf":"ibmrd2106G.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.019496S","chronDate":"Nov.  1977","isNumber":"5390955","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5288520","citationCount":"11","articleId":"5390961","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1977","subType":"IBM","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5390981,"authors":[{"name":"C.

Short and long pulse widths in the waveform are limited by constraints on the minimum and maximum run-lengths of zeros in the coded sequences. These constraints reduce the intersymbol interference in magnetic recording and provide an adequate rate of transition for accurate clocking. Signal power at low frequencies is limited by means of a constraint on a parameter that corresponds to the maximum imbalance in the number of positive and negative pulses of the waveform. This constraint on the maximum accumulated dc charge also eliminates the zero-frequency component. Zero modulation is one such code that is especially suitable for magnetic recording channels. The encoding and decoding algorithm is presented. A one-to-one correspondence between binary data and constrained sequences is established by creating data states that are isomorphic to the charge states having the same growth rate. Sequences with other values of run-length and charge constraint are examined as candidates for other codes with zero dc component.","doi":"10.1147/rd.194.0366","publicationTitle":"IBM Journal of Research and Development","displayPublicationTitle":"IBM Journal of Research and Development","pdfPath":"/iel5/5288520/5391169/05391174.pdf","startPage":"366","endPage":"378","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1147/rd.194.0366","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5391169","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Zero-Modulation Encoding in Magnetic Recording","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IBM","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"July  1975","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5391174/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  1975","displayDocTitle":"Zero-Modulation Encoding in Magnetic Recording","dateOfInsertion":"06 April 2010","volume":"19","issue":"4","publicationDate":"July 1975","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Zero-Modulation Encoding in Magnetic Recording","sourcePdf":"ibmrd1904F.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.016506S","chronDate":"July  1975","isNumber":"5391169","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5288520","citationCount":"33","articleId":"5391174","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1975","subType":"IBM","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":5391197,"authors":[{"name":"H.

It is observed that a viable approach to program tailoring is offered by restructuring techniques. The application of dynamic off-line techniques to the tailoring problem is discussed, and an algorithm which may be used to fit program behavior to the working set model is described in detail as an example. The performance of this algorithm in dealing with two real-program traces is experimentally evaluated under a variety of conditions and found to be always satisfactory.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Tailoring Programs to Models of Program Behavior","publicationTitle":"IBM Journal of Research and Development","doi":"10.1147/rd.193.0244","displayPublicationTitle":"IBM Journal of Research and Development","pdfPath":"/iel5/5288520/5391212/05391217.pdf","startPage":"244","endPage":"251","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1147/rd.193.0244","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5391212","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5391217","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IBM","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5391217/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May  1975","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  1975","displayDocTitle":"Tailoring Programs to Models of Program Behavior","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"19","issue":"3","dateOfInsertion":"06 April 2010","publicationDate":"May 1975","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Tailoring Programs to Models of Program Behavior","sourcePdf":"ibmrd1903F.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.079616S","chronDate":"May  1975","isNumber":"5391212","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5288520","citationCount":"6","articleId":"5391217","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1975","subType":"IBM","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5391240,"authors":[{"name":"R.

Here it is shown that such machines may be made logically reversible at every step, while retaining their simplicity and their ability to do general computations. This result is of great physical interest because it makes plausible the existence of thermodynamically reversible computers which could perform useful computations at useful speed while dissipating considerably less than kT of energy per logical step. In the first stage of its computation the logically reversible automaton parallels the corresponding irreversible automaton, except that it saves all intermediate results, thereby avoiding the irreversible operation of erasure. The second stage consists of printing out the desired output. The third stage then reversibly disposes of all the undesired intermediate results by retracing the steps of the first stage in backward order (a process which is only possible because the first stage has been carried out reversibly), thereby restoring the machine (except for the now-written output tape) to its original condition. The final machine configuration thus contains the desired output and a reconstructed copy of the input, but no other undesired data. The foregoing results are demonstrated explicitly using a type of three-tape Turing machine. The biosynthesis of messenger RNA is discussed as a physical example of reversible computation.","doi":"10.1147/rd.176.0525","publicationTitle":"IBM Journal of Research and Development","displayPublicationTitle":"IBM Journal of Research and Development","pdfPath":"/iel5/5288520/5391321/05391327.pdf","startPage":"525","endPage":"532","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5391321","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1147/rd.176.0525","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Logical Reversibility of Computation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5391327","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IBM","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  1973","displayDocTitle":"Logical Reversibility of Computation","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5391327/","publicationDate":"Nov. 1973","dateOfInsertion":"06 April 2010","isJournal":true,"volume":"17","issue":"6","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov.  1973","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Logical Reversibility of Computation","sourcePdf":"ibmrd1706G.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.023056S","chronDate":"Nov.  1973","isNumber":"5391321","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5288520","citationCount":"635","articleId":"5391327","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1973","subType":"IBM","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":5391341,"authors":[{"name":"P.

A general equation for the total charge transfer is derived, for monoenergetic and for energetically uniform trap distributions, for high fields as well as low fields. The theory predicts the time dependence of the total charge transfer to be initially linear, then roughly logarithmic, and finally to reach saturation. There is no essential difference in the results whether the trap distribution is monoenergetic or energetically uniform. The operational dependence on characteristic parameters is investigated and found to be greatest for changes in the extent of spatial distribution of traps. The switching time varies inversely with trap density and tunnelling probability, and exponentially with the oxide thickness.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IBM","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5391379/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1973","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1973","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","publicationDate":"March 1973","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 April 2010","volume":"17","issue":"2","displayDocTitle":"Theory of MNOS Memory Device Behavior","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Theory of MNOS Memory Device Behavior","sourcePdf":"ibmrd1702F.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.020978S","chronDate":"March  1973","isNumber":"5391374","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5288520","citationCount":"7","articleId":"5391379","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1973","subType":"IBM","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5391392,"authors":[{"name":"C.

The intention is to reveal the influence on the speed of convergence exerted by the number of taps, the step-size parameter in the adjustment loops, and the spectrum of the unequalized signal. Attention is focused on the convergence of the expected mean-square distortion. Several approximations are made in the analysis, among them the approximation of higher-order statistics by second-order statistical parameters. Comparison with results obtained by computer simulation, however, shows that the theory developed renders a quite accurate picture of the convergence process. Previous work in this field demonstrated the limits set to the speed of convergence by the extreme values of the power spectrum of the unequalized signal. It is shown here that, with regard to the mean-square distortion, the influence of the number of taps will usually dominate by far. The theory provides a simple criterion for convergence and answers the question of how to attain the fastest convergence.","doi":"10.1147/rd.166.0546","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5391400","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1147/rd.166.0546","endPage":"555","publicationTitle":"IBM Journal of Research and Development","displayPublicationTitle":"IBM Journal of Research and Development","pdfPath":"/iel5/5288520/5391400/05391401.pdf","startPage":"546","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Theory on the Speed of Convergence in Adaptive Equalizers for Digital Communication","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IBM","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov.  1972","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  1972","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5391401/","displayDocTitle":"Theory on the Speed of Convergence in Adaptive Equalizers for Digital Communication","volume":"16","issue":"6","dateOfInsertion":"06 April 2010","publicationDate":"Nov. 1972","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Theory on the Speed of Convergence in Adaptive Equalizers for Digital Communication","sourcePdf":"ibmrd1606B.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.01224S","chronDate":"Nov.  1972","isNumber":"5391400","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5288520","citationCount":"95","articleId":"5391401","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1972","subType":"IBM","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5391418,"authors":[{"name":"D.

This procedure endows the method with a much wider region of convergence than other methods (occasionally, even global convergence) and enables it to find multiple solutions of g(x) = 0 one after the other.

In these, binary information is transmitted through three-level rather than binary pulse codes for controlling the power distribution in the frequency spectrum, improving clock recovery, allowing error detection or for just increasing the binary data rate. Linear and nonlinear PT codes are considered, the latter being divided into alphabetic and nonalphabetic codes. Among the nonalphabetic codes, emphasis is given to the modified bipolar codes used in pulse code modulation systems. Two recently developed codes of this type are described: High Density Bipolar (HDB) and Compatible High Density Bipolar (CHDB). They are particularly suitable for PCM transmission on repeatered lines. Another nonalphabetic code, the Transparent Interleaved Bipolar (TIB) is presented for the first time. This code features all the advantages of partial-response (or Interleaved Bipolar) signalling and, in addition, guarantees a minimum density of pulses, regardless of the data.","doi":"10.1147/rd.144.0354","publicationTitle":"IBM Journal of Research and Development","displayPublicationTitle":"IBM Journal of Research and Development","pdfPath":"/iel5/5288520/5391621/05391623.pdf","startPage":"354","endPage":"367","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1147/rd.144.0354","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5391621","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Introduction to Pseudoternary Transmission Codes","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5391623","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IBM","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"July  1970","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  1970","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5391623/","displayDocTitle":"Introduction to Pseudoternary Transmission Codes","volume":"14","issue":"4","publicationDate":"July 1970","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 April 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Introduction to Pseudoternary Transmission Codes","sourcePdf":"ibmrd1404D.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.010975S","chronDate":"July  1970","isNumber":"5391621","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5288520","citationCount":"31","articleId":"5391623","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1970","subType":"IBM","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5391624,"authors":[{"name":"P.

An algorithm is developed that determines B(n, d), the maximum number of code words for given d and n \u2264 2d. The maximal code is, then, given by its modular representation, explicitly in terms of certain binary coefficients and constants related to n and d.

The recovered function is shown to consist of several different contributions, the relative strengths of which depend on the number of phase quantization levels. Several specific examples are given. Motivation and interpretation are presented in terms of digitally constructed holograms.","doi":"10.1147/rd.145.0478","publicationTitle":"IBM Journal of Research and Development","displayPublicationTitle":"IBM Journal of Research and Development","pdfPath":"/iel5/5288520/5391641/05391643.pdf","startPage":"478","endPage":"484","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1147/rd.145.0478","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5391641","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Some Effects of Fourier-domain Phase Quantization","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5391643","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IBM","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep.  1970","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep.  1970","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5391643/","displayDocTitle":"Some Effects of Fourier-domain Phase Quantization","volume":"14","issue":"5","publicationDate":"Sep. 1970","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 April 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Some Effects of Fourier-domain Phase Quantization","sourcePdf":"ibmrd1405C.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.028553S","chronDate":"Sep.  1970","isNumber":"5391641","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5288520","citationCount":"18","articleId":"5391643","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1970","subType":"IBM","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5391655,"authors":[{"name":"G.

One of the schemes is a residue mod 3 check and the other is a parity prediction check. The Boolean statements that define the operation of group look-ahead adders, concurrent error detection and the Boolean difference serve as background for interpreting the results of the study. The Boolean difference is a tool for calculating the \u201ccoverage\u201d of elements in a logical network by error-checking schemes. Some weaknesses in prior studies of coverage calculation are brought to light. Tables showing the number of circuit elements in the various portions of adder and error-checking circuits are given. It is shown that the residue mod 3 check adder is not economical unless the addition operands are already provided with the mod 3 check bits. Thus, a worthwhile comparison of the checking schemes should not proceed without considering the overall data flow checking strategy. In machine organizations with three or more data transfer checks, the parity-checked adder seems to offer a cost advantage.","doi":"10.1147/rd.145.0563","publicationTitle":"IBM Journal of Research and Development","displayPublicationTitle":"IBM Journal of Research and Development","pdfPath":"/iel5/5288520/5391641/05391655.pdf","startPage":"563","endPage":"573","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1147/rd.145.0563","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5391641","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Concurrent Error Detection for Group Look-ahead Binary Adders","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IBM","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5391655/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep.  1970","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep.  1970","displayDocTitle":"Concurrent Error Detection for Group Look-ahead Binary Adders","volume":"14","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sep. 1970","dateOfInsertion":"06 April 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Concurrent Error Detection for Group Look-ahead Binary Adders","sourcePdf":"ibmrd1405O.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.036314S","chronDate":"Sep.  1970","isNumber":"5391641","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5288520","citationCount":"35","articleId":"5391655","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1970","subType":"IBM","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5391662,"authors":[{"name":"D.

Some of the elements of the intrinsic transistor, notably the transconductance, are strongly influenced by the saturation of the drift velocity.

A new and hypothetical device is presented in this paper and used to construct a physically analyzable computing system. It is demonstrated that this system has dissipations larger than, but of the same order of magnitude as, the original minimal quantities. It is also shown that any required reliability can be obtained with this device, without increased energy expenditure, but at the expense of an increasing time per computational step.","doi":"10.1147/rd.142.0152","publicationTitle":"IBM Journal of Research and Development","displayPublicationTitle":"IBM Journal of Research and Development","pdfPath":"/iel5/5288520/5391660/05391667.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1147/rd.142.0152","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5391660","startPage":"152","endPage":"157","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Minimal Energy Dissipation in Logic","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5391667","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IBM","displayDocTitle":"Minimal Energy Dissipation in Logic","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1970","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5391667/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1970","isJournal":true,"volume":"14","issue":"2","publicationDate":"March 1970","dateOfInsertion":"06 April 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Minimal Energy Dissipation in Logic","sourcePdf":"ibmrd1402H.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.015652S","chronDate":"March  1970","isNumber":"5391660","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5288520","citationCount":"58","articleId":"5391667","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1970","subType":"IBM","lastupdate":"2021-09-28"},{"_id":5391711,"authors":[{"name":"F.

Our computer holograms differ from a normal hologram in that the transmittance is binary, yet they are able to construct general wavefronts and images efficiently and have several practical advantages over holograms with a continuous range of transmittance.

It is therefore unlikely that a dislocation flow mechanism can relieve stresses in films. Grain boundary sliding and diffusional creep can, however, relieve stresses in films and equations describing the kinetics of stress relaxation are derived. It is suggested that stress relief occurs primarily by a diffusion-creep mechanism.

Rigid copper spheres, which remain rigid during solder reflow, have been used successfully for some time as a major element of the contact joint. However, to expand the capability of such joints to larger devices such as multiple-transistor chips in hybrid components, ductile metallic joining pads can be used on the devices instead of the copper spheres to reduce mechanical strains and permit multi-pad devices to make proper contact to module lands during reflow. This paper describes a technique that prevents these solder pads from collapsing and permits large scale production. Termed \u201ccontrolled collapse,\u201d the method is based on limiting the solderable area of the substrate lands and chip contact terminals so that surface tension in the molten pad and land solder supports the device until the joint solidifies. The result is a sturdy, testable connection of high reliability (bond strength 30\u201350 gm, pilot-production yields exceeding 97%, predicted failure rate\u2014based on laboratory tests\u2014considerably lower than that of copper ball contacts). The process is economically adaptable to automation and offers considerable latitude in fabrication and control tolerances.","doi":"10.1147/rd.133.0239","publicationTitle":"IBM Journal of Research and Development","displayPublicationTitle":"IBM Journal of Research and Development","pdfPath":"/iel5/5288520/5391807/05391809.pdf","startPage":"239","endPage":"250","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5391807","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1147/rd.133.0239","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Controlled Collapse Reflow Chip Joining","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IBM","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May  1969","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5391809/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  1969","displayDocTitle":"Controlled Collapse Reflow Chip Joining","dateOfInsertion":"06 April 2010","publicationDate":"May 1969","isJournal":true,"volume":"13","issue":"3","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Controlled Collapse Reflow Chip Joining","sourcePdf":"ibmrd1303C.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.011577S","chronDate":"May  1969","isNumber":"5391807","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5288520","citationCount":"151","articleId":"5391809","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1969","subType":"IBM","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5391811,"authors":[{"name":"K.

Giant-pulse ruby laser excitation was used in both cases. An end pumping configuration employed with DTTC resulted in narrow beam divergences and high conversion efficiencies. For CAP, the oscillating transition is one which terminates on an excited vibrational level of the ground electronic state. For DTTC, stimulated emission at the lowest concentrations occurs at the peak of the Franck\u2013Condon-shifted fluorescence band but moves to longer wavelengths as the concentration is increased. The transient behavior of the CAP laser, pumped in a transverse geometry, was observed and compared with computer solutions of the rate equations. Polarization measurements of the laser beams were also made.

Organizationally, primary emphasis is placed on (1) alleviating the disparity between storage time and circuit speed, and (2) the development of high speed floating-point arithmetic algorithms. This paper deals mainly with item (1) of the organization. A design is described which improves the ratio of storage bandwidth and access time to cycle time through the use of storage interleaving and CPU buffer registers. It is shown that history recording (the retention of complete instruction loops in the CPU) reduces the need to exercise storage, and that sophisticated employment of buffering techniques has reduced the effective access time.

A review of previous methods and results is first given. A method termed the \u201ccalculus of D-cubes\u201d is then introduced, which allows one to describe and compute the behavior of failing acyclic automata, both internally and externally. An algorithm, called the D-algorithm, is then developed which utilizes this calculus to compute tests to detect failures. First a manual method is presented, by means of an example. Thence, the D-algorithm is precisely described by means of a program written in Iverson notation. Finally, it is shown for the acyclic case in which the automation is constructed from AND's, NAND's, OR's and NOR's that if a test exists, the D-algorithm will compute such a test.","doi":"10.1147/rd.104.0278","publicationTitle":"IBM Journal of Research and Development","displayPublicationTitle":"IBM Journal of Research and Development","pdfPath":"/iel5/5288520/5392029/05392030.pdf","startPage":"278","endPage":"291","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1147/rd.104.0278","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5392029","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Diagnosis of Automata Failures: A Calculus and a Method","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5392030","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IBM","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"July  1966","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  1966","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5392030/","displayDocTitle":"Diagnosis of Automata Failures: A Calculus and a Method","volume":"10","issue":"4","publicationDate":"July 1966","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 April 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Diagnosis of Automata Failures: A Calculus and a Method","sourcePdf":"ibmrd1004B.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.014252S","chronDate":"July  1966","isNumber":"5392029","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5288520","citationCount":"423","articleId":"5392030","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1966","subType":"IBM","lastupdate":"2021-10-22"},{"_id":5392062,"authors":[{"name":"T.

The reference for all comparisons is the conventional frequency-division multiplex telephone system. The comparison study is concerned with theoretical channel parameters as well as practical considerations which are unique to satellite communications. For PN modulation, curves are presented which show the relationship between the intrinsic signal-to-noise ratio and the number of channels per megacycle for a given test-tone-to-noise ratio. It is concluded that high quality voice transmission can be achieved efficiently with PN-multiplexing. In particular, pulsed pseudo-noise transmission with some form of wide-deviation pulse-time message modulation and matched filter reception uses the down-link intrinsic signal-to-noise ratio and bandwidth as efficiently as the conventional single-sideband up and composite frequency-modulation with feedback down, provided that up-link power control is used. For lower quality communications, conventional modulation is more efficient in rf bandwidth utilization. Where rf bandwidth is not a significant factor, but the down-link intrinsic signal-to-noise ratio is important, then in the case of PN modulation, communications can be made thermal noise limited in the down-link. Here PN is, for all practical purposes, as efficient as orthogonal multiplexing.","displayPublicationTitle":"IBM Journal of Research and Development","pdfPath":"/iel5/5288520/5392128/05392132.pdf","startPage":"241","endPage":"255","publicationTitle":"IBM Journal of Research and Development","doi":"10.1147/rd.94.0241","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1147/rd.94.0241","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5392128","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5392132","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Comparison of Pseudo-Noise and Conventional Modulation for Multiple-Access Satellite Communications","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IBM","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5392132/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  1965","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"July  1965","displayDocTitle":"A Comparison of Pseudo-Noise and Conventional Modulation for Multiple-Access Satellite Communications","volume":"9","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"July 1965","dateOfInsertion":"06 April 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Comparison of Pseudo-Noise and Conventional Modulation for Multiple-Access Satellite Communications","sourcePdf":"ibmrd0904E.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.014811S","chronDate":"July  1965","isNumber":"5392128","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5288520","citationCount":"5","articleId":"5392132","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1965","subType":"IBM","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":5392137,"authors":[{"name":"R.

However, for n > 1 the relations recognizable by automata constitute a proper subclass of the n-ary transductions. The 2-ary length-preserving transductions constitute the equilibrium (potential) behavior of 1-dimensional, bilateral iterative networks. The immediate consequence relation of various primitive deductive (respectively computational) systems, such as Post normal systems (respectively Turing machines) are examples of transductions. Other riches deductive systems have immediate consequence relations which are not transductions. The closure properties of the class of transductions are studied.

We suggest: a) that the statistics of telephone errors can be described in terms of an error probability depending solely on the time elapsed since the last occurrence of an error; b) that the distribution of inter-error intervals can be well approximated by a law of Pareto of exponent less than one; the relative number of errors and the equivocation tend, therefore, to zero as the length of the message is increased. The validity of those concepts is demonstrated with the aid of experimental data obtained from the German telephone network. Further consequences, refinements, and uses of the model are described in the body of the paper.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A New Model for Error Clustering in Telephone Circuits","publicationTitle":"IBM Journal of Research and Development","doi":"10.1147/rd.73.0224","displayPublicationTitle":"IBM Journal of Research and Development","pdfPath":"/iel5/5288520/5392300/05392305.pdf","startPage":"224","endPage":"236","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1147/rd.73.0224","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5392300","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5392305","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IBM","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5392305/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"July  1963","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  1963","displayDocTitle":"A New Model for Error Clustering in Telephone Circuits","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"7","issue":"3","dateOfInsertion":"06 April 2010","publicationDate":"July 1963","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A New Model for Error Clustering in Telephone Circuits","sourcePdf":"ibmrd0703F.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.024005S","chronDate":"July  1963","isNumber":"5392300","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5288520","citationCount":"33","articleId":"5392305","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1963","subType":"IBM","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5392337,"authors":[{"name":"G.

Two simple, but representative, models of bistable devices are subjected to a more detailed analysis of switching kinetics to yield the relationship between speed and energy dissipation, and to estimate the effects of errors induced by thermal fluctuations.","doi":"10.1147/rd.53.0183","publicationTitle":"IBM Journal of Research and Development","displayPublicationTitle":"IBM Journal of Research and Development","pdfPath":"/iel5/5288520/5392444/05392446.pdf","startPage":"183","endPage":"191","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1147/rd.53.0183","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5392444","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Irreversibility and Heat Generation in the Computing Process","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IBM","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"July  1961","displayDocTitle":"Irreversibility and Heat Generation in the Computing Process","volume":"5","issue":"3","dateOfInsertion":"06 April 2010","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"July 1961","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5392446/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  1961","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Irreversibility and Heat Generation in the Computing Process","sourcePdf":"ibmrd0503C.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.016285S","chronDate":"July  1961","isNumber":"5392444","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5288520","citationCount":"722","articleId":"5392446","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1961","subType":"IBM","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5392463,"authors":[{"name":"A.

The signal is deformed during its propagation and electromagnetic shock waves are generated. It is pointed out that the shock wave will form in a distance which is short for any parametric amplification purposes. The subsequent growth of the shock and its decay, due to the inevitable dissipation associated with a shock, are analyzed assuming that the capacitance variations are small compared to the total capacitance. The propagation of a small deviation from a signal which is perfectly periodic in time is also examined, and it is shown that the small deviation may spread out in time but cannot be changed in its sign. This result was invoked in an earlier paper demonstrating the impossibility of parametric amplification on dispersionless nonlinear lines.","doi":"10.1147/rd.44.0391","publicationTitle":"IBM Journal of Research and Development","displayPublicationTitle":"IBM Journal of Research and Development","pdfPath":"/iel5/5288520/5392512/05392514.pdf","startPage":"391","endPage":"401","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5392512","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1147/rd.44.0391","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Shock Waves in Nonlinear Transmission Lines and Their Effect on Parametric Amplification","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5392514","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IBM","displayDocTitle":"Shock Waves in Nonlinear Transmission Lines and Their Effect on Parametric Amplification","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5392514/","volume":"4","issue":"4","publicationDate":"Oct. 1960","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 April 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  1960","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct.  1960","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Shock Waves in Nonlinear Transmission Lines and Their Effect on Parametric Amplification","sourcePdf":"ibmrd0404C.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.02226S","chronDate":"Oct.  1960","isNumber":"5392512","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5288520","citationCount":"35","articleId":"5392514","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1960","subType":"IBM","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":5392531,"authors":[{"name":"C.

In particular, error bursts can be corrected with a minimum amount of redundancy. Because each parity-bit group is derived by using maximum-length shift-register sequences, rather than by storing a decoding table, the implementation of these codes is relatively simple, as shown in an example of a three-bit-wide burst-correcting code. An example is given of an application of these codes in a data transmission system where only an even number of bits is likely to be corrupted by a noise burst.","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5392531","doi":"10.1147/rd.41.0058","displayPublicationTitle":"IBM Journal of Research and Development","pdfPath":"/iel5/5288520/5392525/05392531.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1147/rd.41.0058","startPage":"58","endPage":"65","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5392525","publicationTitle":"IBM Journal of Research and Development","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A New Group of Codes for Correction of Dependent Errors in Data Transmission","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IBM","displayDocTitle":"A New Group of Codes for Correction of Dependent Errors in Data Transmission","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5392531/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  1960","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  1960","volume":"4","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 April 2010","publicationDate":"Jan. 1960","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A New Group of Codes for Correction of Dependent Errors in Data Transmission","sourcePdf":"ibmrd0401G.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.013433S","chronDate":"Jan.  1960","isNumber":"5392525","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5288520","citationCount":"7","articleId":"5392531","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1960","subType":"IBM","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5392532,"authors":[{"name":"Satosi Watanabe","firstName":"Satosi","lastName":"Watanabe","id":"38184347200"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-8646"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"0018-8646"}],"articleNumber":"5392532","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":70,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":729},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IBM","url":"http://www.research.ibm.com/journal/staff.html"}],"abstract":"A set \u03bb of stochastic variables, y\n<inf xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1</inf>\n ,y\n<inf xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</inf>\n, \u2026, y\n<inf xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">n</inf>\n, is grouped into subsets, \u00b5\n<inf xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1</inf>\n, \u00b5\n<inf xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</inf>\n, ..., \u00b5\n<inf xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">k</inf>\n.

Two parallel treatments are given, one viewing it as an abstract mathematical problem, the other considering it as an engineering problem.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Algebraic Topological Methods for the Synthesis of Switching Systems\u2014Part III: Minimization of Nonsingular Boolean Trees","publicationTitle":"IBM Journal of Research and Development","doi":"10.1147/rd.34.0326","displayPublicationTitle":"IBM Journal of Research and Development","pdfPath":"/iel5/5288520/5392571/05392573.pdf","startPage":"326","endPage":"344","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1147/rd.34.0326","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5392571","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5392573","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IBM","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5392573/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct.  1959","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  1959","displayDocTitle":"Algebraic Topological Methods for the Synthesis of Switching Systems\u2014Part III: Minimization of Nonsingular Boolean Trees","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"3","issue":"4","dateOfInsertion":"06 April 2010","publicationDate":"Oct. 1959","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Algebraic Topological Methods for the Synthesis of Switching Systems\u2014Part III: Minimization of Nonsingular Boolean Trees","sourcePdf":"ibmrd0304C.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.010977S","chronDate":"Oct.  1959","isNumber":"5392571","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5288520","citationCount":"12","articleId":"5392573","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1959","subType":"IBM","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":5392588,"authors":[{"name":"H.

For a channel which corrupts no more than one binary digit in each sequence of length n, he constructed alphabets, the so-called Hamming codes, which permit error-free signalling. The authors study the analogous problem for channels which can corrupt a greater number of digits. Non-binary channels are also studied, and analogues of the Hamming codes are constructed. It is perhaps of interest that some of the techniques employed derive from algebraic and analytic number theory, mathematical disciplines not generally associated with the type of applied problems considered in this paper.","doi":"10.1147/rd.31.0025","publicationTitle":"IBM Journal of Research and Development","displayPublicationTitle":"IBM Journal of Research and Development","pdfPath":"/iel5/5288520/5392584/05392588.pdf","startPage":"25","endPage":"34","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1147/rd.31.0025","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5392584","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5392588","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the Mathematical Theory of Error-Correcting Codes","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IBM","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  1959","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  1959","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5392588/","displayDocTitle":"On the Mathematical Theory of Error-Correcting Codes","volume":"3","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 1959","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 April 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the Mathematical Theory of Error-Correcting Codes","sourcePdf":"ibmrd0301E.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.014028S","chronDate":"Jan.  1959","isNumber":"5392584","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5288520","citationCount":"14","articleId":"5392588","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1959","subType":"IBM","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5392601,"authors":[{"name":"M.

The second type of coding is ordinary block coding into vectors of binary digits, with the added requirement that the coded vectors be processed digit by digit.

The electric field is then found, and approximate space charge neutrality is restored, by adding a particular solution of the transport equation in which the electric field is associated only with space charge but not with a current. The presence of point scatterers leads to a dipole field about each scatterer.

Steps include the statistical analysis of a collection of documents in a field of interest, the establishment of a set of \u201cnotions\u201d and the vocabulary by which they are expressed, the compilation of a thesaurus-type dictionary and index, the automatic encoding of documents by machine with the aid of such a dictionary, the encoding of topological notations (such as branched structures), the recording of the coded information, the establishment of a searching pattern for finding pertinent information, and the programming of appropriate machines to carry out a search.","publicationTitle":"IBM Journal of Research and Development","displayPublicationTitle":"IBM Journal of Research and Development","pdfPath":"/iel5/5288520/5392692/05392697.pdf","startPage":"309","endPage":"317","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Statistical Approach to Mechanized Encoding and Searching of Literary Information","doi":"10.1147/rd.14.0309","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5392692","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1147/rd.14.0309","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5392697","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IBM","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5392697/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct.  1957","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  1957","displayDocTitle":"A Statistical Approach to Mechanized Encoding and Searching of Literary Information","dateOfInsertion":"06 April 2010","publicationDate":"Oct. 1957","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"1","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Statistical Approach to Mechanized Encoding and Searching of Literary Information","sourcePdf":"ibmrd0104D.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.021181S","chronDate":"Oct.  1957","isNumber":"5392692","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5288520","citationCount":"81","articleId":"5392697","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1957","subType":"IBM","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":5392713,"authors":[{"name":"A.

The thermal bath is treated both classically and quantum mechanically, and the theory is similar to, and a generalization of, conventional theories of time proportional transition probabilities. Relaxation of the system by the thermal bath is expressed by a linear matrix operator, and it is stressed that elements of this operator can be regarded as secular or nonsecular perturbations on the equation of motion and can be treated accordingly. When the motion of the system is slow compared to that of the thermal bath, the equation of motion can be expressed in an operator form which is independent of representation. If the system has a time-dependent Hamiltonian which varies slowly compared to the motion of the thermal bath, the same equation of motion is obeyed and the system is relaxed by the bath toward a Boltzmann distribution with respect to its instantaneous Hamiltonian. If the time variation of the Hamiltonian is more rapid, higher order corrections to the equation of motion must be applied. The theory is applied to spin-lattice relaxation of a coupled nuclear spin system in a metal, for arbitrary externally applied fixed magnetic field.","doi":"10.1147/rd.11.0019","publicationTitle":"IBM Journal of Research and Development","displayPublicationTitle":"IBM Journal of Research and Development","pdfPath":"/iel5/5288520/5392709/05392713.pdf","startPage":"19","endPage":"31","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1147/rd.11.0019","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5392709","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the Theory of Relaxation Processes","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IBM","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5392713/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  1957","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  1957","displayDocTitle":"On the Theory of Relaxation Processes","volume":"1","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 1957","dateOfInsertion":"06 April 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the Theory of Relaxation Processes","sourcePdf":"ibmrd0101D.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.017815S","chronDate":"Jan.  1957","isNumber":"5392709","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5288520","citationCount":"1","articleId":"5392713","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1957","subType":"IBM","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5392733,"authors":[{"name":"W.

A fuzzy logic is fully defined by its membership function. What is the best to determine the membership function is the first question that has been tackled. Thus it is important to select the accurate membership functions but these methods possess one common weakness where conventional FLC use membership function generated by human operators. The membership function selection process is done with trial and error and it runs step by step which is too long in completing the problem. This research develops a system that may help users to determine the membership function of FLC using the technique of GA optimization for the fastest processing in completing the problems. The data collection is based on the simulation results and the results refer to the transient response specification is maximum overshoot. From the results presented, the system which we developed is very helpful to determine membership function and it is clear that GA is very promising in improving the performance of the FLC to get more accurate in order to find the optimum result.","doi":"10.1109/FCST.2009.86","pdfPath":"/iel5/5392746/5392815/05392892.pdf","startPage":"364","endPage":"370","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Fourth International Conference on Frontier of Computer Science and Technology","publicationTitle":"2009 Fourth International Conference on Frontier of Computer Science and Technology","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FCST.2009.86","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5392815","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The Application of Genetic Algorithm into Membership Function FLC Used Floating Point","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5392892/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-19 Dec. 2009","displayDocTitle":"The Application of Genetic Algorithm into Membership Function FLC Used Floating Point","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2010","accessionNumber":"11118970","publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5392892/","conferenceDate":"17-19 Dec. 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Application of Genetic Algorithm into Membership Function FLC Used Floating Point","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"3932a364.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060811S","chronDate":"17-19 Dec. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5392746","isNumber":"5392815","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5392746","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5392815","articleId":"5392892","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5392895,"authors":[{"name":"Haiqin Xu","affiliation":["College of Information Sciences and Technology, Donghua Uinversity, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Haiqin","lastName":"Xu","id":"38105619900"},{"name":"Yongsheng Ding","affiliation":["College of Information Sciences and Technology Engineering Research Center of Digitized Textile & Fashion Technology, Ministry of Education, Donghua Uinversity, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Yongsheng","lastName":"Ding","id":"37277996600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5467-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5466-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3932-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2159-6301"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2159-631X"}],"articleNumber":"5392895","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":10,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":239},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5392895","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Design optimization","Analog circuits","Algorithm design and analysis","Genetic algorithms","Immune system","Educational technology","Textile technology","Circuit synthesis","Hardware","Convergence"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["analogue circuits","circuit optimisation","circuit simulation","genetic algorithms","network synthesis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["analog circuit design optimization","adaptive immune genetic algorithm","multi-dimensional parameter optimization","low-pass filter"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Analog circuit","Evolutionary hardware design","Immune genetic","Genetic algorithm","Immune algorithm"]}],"doi":"10.1109/FCST.2009.79","pdfPath":"/iel5/5392746/5392815/05392895.pdf","publicationTitle":"2009 Fourth International Conference on Frontier of Computer Science and Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Fourth International Conference on Frontier of Computer Science and Technology","startPage":"359","endPage":"363","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5392815","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FCST.2009.79","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimizing Method for Analog Circuit Design Using Adaptive Immune Genetic Algorithm","abstract":"The design of an analog circuit is so complex that much time is required.

Using the reputation-aware technique, the dynamic scheduling strategy is proposed to improve the capability of predicting the reliability and credibility for data-intensive applications. To incorporate reputation service into job scheduling, we introduce a new performance metric, degree of reputation sufficiency, to quantitatively measure quality of reputation service provided by data grids.

Behavior Study of Block Cryptography Algorithms on GPGPU","abstract":"Recently many studies have been made to map cryptography algorithms onto graphics processors (GPU), and gained great performances. This paper does not focus on the performance of a specific program exploited by using all kinds of optimization methods algorithmically, but the intrinsic reason which lies in GPU architectural features for this performance improvement. Thus we present a study of several block encryption algorithms(AES, TRI-DES, RC5, TWOFISH and the chained block cipher formed by their combinations) processing on GPU using CUDA. We introduce our CUDA implementations, and investigate the program behavioral characteristics and their impacts on the performance in four aspects. We find that the number of threads used by a CUDA program can affect the overall performance fundamentally. Many block encryption algorithms can benefit from the shared memory if the capacity is large enough to hold the lookup tables. The data stored in device memory should be organized purposely to avoid performance degradation. Besides, the communication between host and device may turn out to be the bottleneck of a program. Through these analyses we hope to find out an effective way to optimize a CUDA program, as well as to reveal some desirable architectural features to support block encryption applications better.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"17-19 Dec. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5392941/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5392941/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11119006","conferenceDate":"17-19 Dec. 2009","publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A Program Behavior Study of Block Cryptography Algorithms on GPGPU","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Program Behavior Study of Block Cryptography Algorithms on GPGPU","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"3932a033.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052759S","chronDate":"17-19 Dec. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5392746","isNumber":"5392815","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5392746","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"5392815","articleId":"5392941","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5392969,"authors":[{"name":"Wu-Hua Chen","affiliation":["School of Computing and Mathematics, University of Western Ontario, Penrith, NSW, Australia","College of Mathematics and Information Science, Guangxi University, Nanning, Guangxi, China"],"firstName":"Wu-Hua","lastName":"Chen","id":"37279192800"},{"name":"Wei Xing Zheng","affiliation":["School of Computing and Mathematics, University of Western Ontario, Penrith, NSW, Australia"],"firstName":"Wei Xing","lastName":"Zheng","id":"37288601200"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1045-9227"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0093"}],"articleNumber":"5392969","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":39,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":537},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computational Intelligence Society","url":"http://ieee-cis.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Robust stability","Stochastic processes","Neural networks","Delay","Stability criteria","Artificial neural networks","Stability analysis","Linear matrix inequalities","Australia","Mathematics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["asymptotic stability","delays","linear matrix inequalities","Lyapunov methods","mean square error methods","neural nets","robust control","stochastic systems","uncertain systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["robust stability analysis","time-varying delay","mean square exponential stability","stochastic delayed neural networks","discretized Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional method","free-weighting matrix technique"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Delay-dependent criteria","linear matrix inequality (LMI)","mean square exponential stability","neural networks"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Computer Simulation","Humans","Neural Networks (Computer)","Stochastic Processes","Time Factors"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5392969","abstract":"This brief investigates the problem of mean square exponential stability of uncertain stochastic delayed neural networks (DNNs) with time-varying delay.

As is well known, PLC channels usually suffer from significant degradation due to impulsive interference generated by electrical appliances. The use of a level limiter is a simple and intuitive technique, widely used to mitigate the noxious effect of impulsive noise in these channels. However, the determination of the clipping threshold remains, most of the time, empirical, and the impulse statistics are usually assumed to be known. In a previous study, we proposed an original threshold determination based on signal detection theory, using the well-known false alarm and good detection tradeoff. Here, we further investigate the proposed optimization method in closed form. We compare two tradeoff criteria by means of a receiver operating curves analysis. We clearly show that the resulting decision fits well with encountered bit-error rate performances. We also evaluate the influence of impulsive noise statistics estimation on the performance of the proposed approach. To do so, we assess the robustness of the classical method of moments on Gaussian mixture estimation. It clearly appears that the estimation method is reliable for reasonable values of the impulse occurrence. As one of the main results of this paper, we make a proposal for impulse statistics estimation under \u00bfsevere\u00bf conditions (i.e., for very rare impulse events, based on impulse detection over corrupted OFDM symbols). Subsequently, we propose a general scheme of automatic impulse mitigation, according to the disturbance ratio of the environment. Finally, the performance of the approach is evaluated over the Home-Plug AV (HPAV) physical layer.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive Noise Mitigation in Impulsive Environment: Application to Power-Line Communications","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","doi":"10.1109/TPWRD.2009.2035505","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","pdfPath":"/iel5/61/5437451/05392970.pdf","startPage":"647","endPage":"656","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPWRD.2009.2035505","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5437451","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5392970","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5392970/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 January 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2010","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive Noise Mitigation in Impulsive Environment: Application to Power-Line Communications","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"25","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/5392970/","dateOfInsertion":"22 March 2010","publicationDate":"April 2010","accessionNumber":"11204455","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive Noise Mitigation in Impulsive Environment: Application to Power-Line Communications","sourcePdf":"tpwrd-ndo-2035505.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.067361S","chronDate":"April  2010","xplore-pub-id":"61","isNumber":"5437451","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"61","citationCount":"76","xplore-issue":"5437451","articleId":"5392970","onlineDate":"19 January 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5392982,"authors":[{"name":"Nikolas Flourentzou","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Information Engineering, University of Sydney, NSW, Australia"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/61/5491350/5392982/5392982-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Nikolas Flourentzou (M\u201904\u2013S\u201907) received the B.Eng. degree in electronics and communications engineering from the University of Birmingham, Birmingham, U.K., in 2002 and the joint M.Sc. degree in power electronics and drives from the University of Birmingham and the University of Nottingham, Nottingham, U.K., in 2003, and is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree in power systems at the University of Sydney, Sydney, Australia.","His field of interest is power-electronic converters for power system applications."]},"firstName":"Nikolas","lastName":"Flourentzou","id":"37397337700"},{"name":"Vassilios.

For the fabricated prototype BPF, the measured minimum DM insertion losses for the first and second bands are 2.4 and 2.82 dB, respectively, whereas the measured CM insertion loss is larger than 25 dB in 1-7 GHz.","doi":"10.1109/LMWC.2009.2038433","publicationTitle":"IEEE Microwave and Wireless Components Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Microwave and Wireless Components Letters","pdfPath":"/iel5/7260/5410120/05392984.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LMWC.2009.2038433","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5410120","startPage":"70","endPage":"72","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Balanced Dual-Band BPF With Stub-Loaded SIRs for Common-Mode Suppression","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5392984","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Balanced Dual-Band BPF With Stub-Loaded SIRs for Common-Mode Suppression","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5392984/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 January 2010","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"20","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Feb. 2010","accessionNumber":"11105783","dateOfInsertion":"08 February 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5392984/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Balanced Dual-Band BPF With Stub-Loaded SIRs for Common-Mode Suppression","sourcePdf":"20lmwc02-clee-2038433.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.091431S","chronDate":"Feb.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"7260","isNumber":"5410120","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7260","citationCount":"91","xplore-issue":"5410120","articleId":"5392984","onlineDate":"19 January 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5392985,"authors":[{"name":"Hong-Yeh Chang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Central University, Taoyuan, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Hong-Yeh","lastName":"Chang","id":"37280775200"},{"name":"Ching-Yan Chan","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Central University, Taoyuan, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Ching-Yan","lastName":"Chan","id":"37859142600"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1531-1309"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-1764"}],"articleNumber":"5392985","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":40,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":1721},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society","url":"http://www.mtt.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Switches","CMOS process","CMOS technology","Insertion loss","Isolation technology","Circuit optimization","Switching circuits","Frequency","Parasitic capacitance","MOSFETs"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS integrated circuits","intermodulation","MOSFET","switches"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["low loss high isolation DC-SPDT traveling-wave switch","body bias technique","CMOS process","broadband single-port double-throw traveling-wave switch","CMOS technology","parasitic capacitance","NMOS transistor","insertion loss","third-order intermodulation","frequency 60 GHz","frequency 30 GHz"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["CMOS","microwave","millimeter-wave","switch","traveling wave"]}],"abstract":"In this letter, a low loss high isolation broadband single-port double-throw (SPDT) traveling-wave switch using 90 nm CMOS technology is presented.

Specifically, in a large-deviation setting, we are interested in algorithms that maximize the asymptotic decay rate of the queue-overflow probability, as the queue-overflow threshold approaches infinity. We first derive an upper bound on the decay rate of the queue-overflow probability over all scheduling policies. We then focus on a class of scheduling algorithms collectively referred to as the \u201c\u03b1-algorithms.\u201d For a given \u03b1 \u2265 1, the \u03b1-algorithm picks the user for service at each time that has the largest product of the transmission rate multiplied by the backlog raised to the power \u03b1. We show that when the overflow metric is appropriately modified, the minimum-cost-to-overflow under the \u03b1-algorithm can be achieved by a simple linear path, and it can be written as the solution of a vector-optimization problem. Using this structural property, we then show that when \u03b1 approaches infinity, the \u03b1-algorithms asymptotically achieve the largest decay rate of the queue-overflow probability. Finally, this result enables us to design scheduling algorithms that are both close to optimal in terms of the asymptotic decay rate of the overflow probability and empirically shown to maintain small queue-overflow probabilities over queue-length ranges of practical interest.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking","pdfPath":"/iel5/90/5484926/05392988.pdf","startPage":"788","endPage":"801","publicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking","doi":"10.1109/TNET.2009.2037896","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNET.2009.2037896","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5484926","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5392988","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On Wireless Scheduling Algorithms for Minimizing the Queue-Overflow Probability","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Scheduling algorithm","Downlink","H infinity control","Stability","Upper bound","Algorithm design and analysis","System performance","Throughput","Land mobile radio cellular systems","Interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optimisation","probability","queueing theory","radio networks","scheduling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wireless scheduling algorithms","queue-overflow probability","asymptotic decay rate","queue-overflow threshold","vector-optimization problem","wireless networks"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Asymptotically optimal algorithms","cellular system","large deviations","queue-overflow probability","wireless scheduling"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5392988/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 January 2010","displayDocTitle":"On Wireless Scheduling Algorithms for Minimizing the Queue-Overflow Probability","volume":"18","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/5392988/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2010","accessionNumber":"11429384","dateOfInsertion":"14 June 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On Wireless Scheduling Algorithms for Minimizing the Queue-Overflow Probability","sourcePdf":"tnet-lin-2037896.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.10653S","chronDate":"June  2010","xplore-pub-id":"90","isNumber":"5484926","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"90","citationCount":"27","xplore-issue":"5484926","articleId":"5392988","onlineDate":"19 January 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5392991,"authors":[{"name":"Austin Ying-Kuang Chen","affiliation":["Alcatel-Lucent, Bell Laboratories, Murray Hill, NJ, USA","Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, USA"],"firstName":"Austin Ying-Kuang","lastName":"Chen","id":"37403710500"},{"name":"Yves Baeyens","affiliation":["Alcatel-Lucent, Bell Laboratories, Murray Hill, NJ, USA"],"firstName":"Yves","lastName":"Baeyens","id":"37269986000"},{"name":"Young-Kai Chen","affiliation":["Alcatel-Lucent, Bell Laboratories, Murray Hill, NJ, USA"],"firstName":"Young-Kai","lastName":"Chen","id":"37281024200"},{"name":"Jenshan Lin","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, USA"],"firstName":"Jenshan","lastName":"Lin","id":"37278771300"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1531-1309"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-1764"}],"articleNumber":"5392991","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":36,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":1590},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society","url":"http://www.mtt.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5392991","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Silicon germanium","Germanium silicon alloys","BiCMOS integrated circuits","Low-noise amplifiers","Millimeter wave technology","Noise measurement","Design optimization","Linearity","Wideband","Gain"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["BiCMOS integrated circuits","Ge-Si alloys","III-V semiconductors","low noise amplifiers","millimetre wave imaging","wideband amplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["BiCMOS low-noise amplifier","millimeter-wave active imaging","two-stage millimeter-wave low-noise amplifier","LNA","power consumption","noise figure 3 dB","frequency 69 GHz to 83.5 GHz","gain 14.5 dB","power 37 mW"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Automotive radar","low-noise amplifier (LNA)","millimeter-wave (mm-wave)","SiGe BiCMOS","W-band"]}],"abstract":"This letter presents a low-power linear and wideband two-stage millimeter-wave low-noise amplifier (LNA) fabricated in a low-cost 0.18 \u00bfm SiGe BiCMOS technology.

Under this paradigm, CR nodes access the spectrum opportunistically by continuously monitoring the operating channels. A key challenge in this domain is how the nodes in a CR network (CRN) cooperate to access the medium in order to maximize the CRN throughput. Typical multichannel MAC protocols assume that frequency channels are adjacent and that there are no constraints on the transmission power. However, a CRN may operate over a wide range of frequencies, and a power mask is often enforced on the transmission of a CR user to avoid corrupting the transmissions of spectrum-licensed primary-radio (PR) users. To avoid unnecessary blocking of CR transmissions, we propose a novel \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">distance-dependent</i>\n MAC protocol for CRNs. Our protocol, called DDMAC, attempts to maximize the CRN throughput. It uses a novel probabilistic channel assignment mechanism that exploits the dependence between the signal's attenuation model and the transmission distance while considering the traffic profile. DDMAC allows a pair of CR users to communicate on a channel that may not be optimal from one user's perspective, but that allows more concurrent transmissions to take place, especially under moderate and high traffic loads. Simulation results indicate that, compared to typical multichannel CSMA-based protocols, DDMAC reduces the blocking rate of CR requests by up to 30%, which consequently improves the network throughput.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5392993/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 January 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"18","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"16 August 2010","accessionNumber":"11473495","htmlLink":"/document/5392993/","displayDocTitle":"Cooperative Adaptive Spectrum Sharing in Cognitive Radio Networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cooperative Adaptive Spectrum Sharing in Cognitive Radio Networks","sourcePdf":"tnet-hbanysalameh-2039490-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.112329S","chronDate":"Aug.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"90","isNumber":"5550304","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"90","citationCount":"68","xplore-issue":"5550304","articleId":"5392993","onlineDate":"19 January 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-12"},{"_id":5392999,"authors":[{"name":"Yong-Sub Lee","affiliation":["Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, Pohang University of Science and Technology, Pohang, South Korea"],"firstName":"Yong-Sub","lastName":"Lee","id":"37281125700"},{"name":"Mun-Woo Lee","affiliation":["Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, Pohang University of Science and Technology, Pohang, South Korea"],"firstName":"Mun-Woo","lastName":"Lee","id":"37405518800"},{"name":"Sang-Ho Kam","affiliation":["Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, Pohang University of Science and Technology, Pohang, South Korea"],"firstName":"Sang-Ho","lastName":"Kam","id":"37410698900"},{"name":"Yoon-Ha Jeong","affiliation":["Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, Pohang University of Science and Technology, Pohang, South Korea"],"firstName":"Yoon-Ha","lastName":"Jeong","id":"37278463700"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1531-1309"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-1764"}],"articleNumber":"5392999","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":16,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":1153},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society","url":"http://www.mtt.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5392999","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Broadband amplifiers","High power amplifiers","Voltage","Circuits","Wideband","Multiaccess communication","Linearity","Size control","Impedance","Predistortion"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["analogue circuits","broadband networks","intermodulation","power amplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["high-linearity wideband power amplifier","cascaded third-order analog predistorters","memory effects","high drain bias voltage","decoupling capacitors","intermodulations","frequency 2.14 GHz"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Analog predistorter (APD)","drain bias","linearity","memory effects","power amplifier (PA)"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5410120","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Microwave and Wireless Components Letters","publicationTitle":"IEEE Microwave and Wireless Components Letters","doi":"10.1109/LMWC.2009.2038557","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A High-Linearity Wideband Power Amplifier With Cascaded Third-Order Analog Predistorters","startPage":"112","endPage":"114","pdfPath":"/iel5/7260/5410120/05392999.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LMWC.2009.2038557","abstract":"A high-linearity wideband analog predistortion power amplifier (PA) is presented.

The proposed algorithm incorporates the local spatial information and gray level information in a novel fuzzy way. The new algorithm is called fuzzy local information C-Means (FLICM). FLICM can overcome the disadvantages of the known fuzzy c-means algorithms and at the same time enhances the clustering performance. The major characteristic of FLICM is the use of a fuzzy local (both spatial and gray level) similarity measure, aiming to guarantee noise insensitiveness and image detail preservation. Furthermore, the proposed algorithm is fully free of the empirically adjusted parameters (\n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">a</i>\n, \u00bf\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">g</sub>\n, \u00bf\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">s</sub>\n, etc.) incorporated into all other fuzzy c-means algorithms proposed in the literature.

In practice, a large portion of the on chip power is consumed by the clock system which is made of the clock distribution network and flop-flops. In this paper, various design techniques for a low power clocking system are surveyed. Among them is an effective way to reduce capacity of the clock load by minimizing number of clocked transistors. To approach this, we propose a novel clocked pair shared flip-flop which reduces the number of local clocked transistors by approximately 40%. A 24% reduction of clock driving power is achieved. In addition, low swing and double edge clocking, can be easily incorporated into the new flip-flop to build clocking systems.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5393037/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 January 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2011","volume":"19","issue":"5","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11972032","dateOfInsertion":"25 April 2011","publicationDate":"May 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5393037/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Design of Sequential Elements for Low Power Clocking System","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design of Sequential Elements for Low Power Clocking System","sourcePdf":"tvlsi-pzhao-2038705-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.065384S","chronDate":"May  2011","xplore-pub-id":"92","isNumber":"5755591","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"39","xplore-issue":"5755591","articleId":"5393037","onlineDate":"19 January 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":5393043,"authors":[{"name":"Wei-Chieh Huang","affiliation":["Graduate Institute of Communication Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/11/5419214/5393043/5393043-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Wei-Chieh Huang was born in Taipei, Taiwan, in 1982.

In the proposed approach, the orthogonality between the signal subspace and the noise subspace induced by the virtual carriers (VCs) is exploited to estimate the channel status of each user. The redundancy provided by the sub-carriers of the non-active users is then adopted to enhance the channel estimation performance. It is shown that while the proposed subspace-based channel estimation scheme is feasible for both sub-band and interleaved OFDMA systems, it is particularly effective for interleaved OFDMA systems due to their improved frequency diversity characteristic. In addition, a novel scheme, designated as the virtual carrier recovery (VCR) scheme, is proposed to further enhance the performance of the channel estimation process by recovering the VCs to zeros at the receiver end. The simulation results demonstrate that the VCR scheme yields a significant improvement in the channel estimation performance; particularly for the case of partially-loaded OFDMA systems. It is also shown that the proposed VCR scheme has a comparable bit error rate (BER) performance to that of the case when the receiver has perfect channel state information (CSI).","doi":"10.1109/TBC.2009.2039519","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Broadcasting","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Broadcasting","pdfPath":"/iel5/11/5419214/05393043.pdf","startPage":"58","endPage":"65","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TBC.2009.2039519","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5419214","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Subspace-Based Semi-Blind Channel Estimation in Uplink OFDMA Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5393043","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 January 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5393043/","displayDocTitle":"Subspace-Based Semi-Blind Channel Estimation in Uplink OFDMA Systems","volume":"56","issue":"1","publicationDate":"March 2010","accessionNumber":"11154886","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5393043/","dateOfInsertion":"22 February 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Subspace-Based Semi-Blind Channel Estimation in Uplink OFDMA Systems","sourcePdf":"tbc-li-2039519.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.079647S","chronDate":"March  2010","xplore-pub-id":"11","isNumber":"5419214","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"11","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"5419214","articleId":"5393043","onlineDate":"19 January 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5393044,"authors":[{"name":"Khalil Salehian","affiliation":["Communications Rcscarch Centre, Ottawa, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/11/5419214/5393044/5393044-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Khalil Salehian received the B.Sc. and M.Sc. in electrical engineering in 1971 and 1974 from Pahlavi University in Iran and completed graduate studies in Computer Science in 1999 at Concordia University in Montreal, Canada.

Moreover, we derive the optimal cancellation signals to minimize the total sidelobe power subject to a self-interference constraint. Numerical results show that, when the guard bandwidth is equal to one OFDM subcarrier interval, the EAIC-CP scheme offers more than a 45.0-dB sidelobe suppression with unnoticeable signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) loss at a symbol error rate (SER) from 10\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">-2</sup>\n to 10\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">-3</sup>\n for 64 quadratic-amplitude modulation (64QAM). Moreover, the EAIC-CP scheme can achieve high spectrum efficiency with low implementation complexity.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2010.2040848","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/5463253/05393050.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2010.2040848","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5463253","startPage":"1689","endPage":"1695","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Extended Active Interference Cancellation for Sidelobe Suppression in Cognitive Radio OFDM Systems With Cyclic Prefix","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5393050","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Extended Active Interference Cancellation for Sidelobe Suppression in Cognitive Radio OFDM Systems With Cyclic Prefix","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5393050/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 January 2010","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"59","issue":"4","publicationDate":"May 2010","accessionNumber":"11285962","dateOfInsertion":"27 May 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5393050/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Extended Active Interference Cancellation for Sidelobe Suppression in Cognitive Radio OFDM Systems With Cyclic Prefix","sourcePdf":"tvt-jiang-2040848.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.108987S","chronDate":"May  2010","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"5463253","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"81","xplore-issue":"5463253","articleId":"5393050","onlineDate":"19 January 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5393051,"authors":[{"name":"Alexandr M.

The system model consists of base stations (BS) that can optimize uplink frequency allocation to their subscriber stations (SS) to achieve the least impact of IM on the useful signal, assuming no control over band allocation of other BSs sharing the same bands. It is demonstrated that when the number of SSs that share the same frequency approaches the number of antenna elements at a BS, the potential performance gain is most significant for the IM-based DSA compared to the random frequency allocation. A \u00bfgood neighbor\u00bf decentralized DSA strategy is introduced. The convergence and convergence rate of IM-based DSA are investigated by means of the theory of absorbing Markov chains and statistical simulations. It is shown that the \u00bfgood neighbor\u00bf strategy leads to much better convergence properties of the entire system compared with the conventional \u00bfselfish\u00bf approach. This suggests that the \u00bfgood neighbor\u00bf IM-based DSA techniques may have a practical perspective even in the scenarios, where global convergence with probability one cannot be established.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Decentralized Dynamic Spectrum Allocation Based on Adaptive Antenna Array Interference Mitigation Diversity","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2010.2040688","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/5427215/05393051.pdf","startPage":"2246","endPage":"2260","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2010.2040688","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5427215","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5393051","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5393051/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 January 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2010","displayDocTitle":"Decentralized Dynamic Spectrum Allocation Based on Adaptive Antenna Array Interference Mitigation Diversity","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"58","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/5393051/","dateOfInsertion":"08 March 2010","publicationDate":"April 2010","accessionNumber":"11168901","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Decentralized Dynamic Spectrum Allocation Based on Adaptive Antenna Array Interference Mitigation Diversity","sourcePdf":"58tsp04-akuzminskiy-2040688.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.10408S","chronDate":"April  2010","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"5427215","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"5427215","articleId":"5393051","onlineDate":"19 January 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5393061,"authors":[{"name":"Tat Luat Nguyen","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/5567234/5393061/5393061-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Tat Luat Nguyen received the M.

However, the use of the latest low voltage power MOSFET generations and the continuously increasing range of switching frequencies have made it necessary to review this model to account for the parasitic inductances that it does not include. This paper presents a complete analytical switching loss model for power MOSFETs in low voltage switching converters that includes the most relevant parasitic elements. It clarifies the switching process, providing information about how these parasitics, especially the inductances, determine switching losses and hence the final converter efficiency. The analysis presented in this paper yields two different types of possible switching situations: capacitance-limited switching and inductance-limited switching. This paper shows that, while the piecewise linear model may be applied in the former, the proposed model is more accurate for the latter. Carefully-obtained experimental results, described in detail, support the analytical results presented.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5393066/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 January 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2010","volume":"25","issue":"6","publicationDate":"June 2010","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"07 June 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5393066/","accessionNumber":"11341330","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"An Insight into the Switching Process of Power MOSFETs: An Improved Analytical Losses Model","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Insight into the Switching Process of Power MOSFETs: An Improved Analytical Losses Model","sourcePdf":"tpel-rodrguez-2040852.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.06108S","chronDate":"June  2010","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"5463201","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"125","xplore-issue":"5463201","articleId":"5393066","onlineDate":"19 January 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-09"},{"_id":5393068,"authors":[{"name":"Ren\u00e9 Vargas","affiliation":["Research and Development Traction Converters, ABB Switzerland Limited, Turgi, Switzerland"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/5463201/5393068/5393068-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Ren\u00e9 Vargas (S\u201905\u2013M\u201909) received the Engineer and M.Sc. degrees in electronics engineering, in 2005, and the Ph.D. degree for his work on predictive control applied to matrix converters, in 2009, from the Universidad T\u00e9cnica Federico Santa Mar\u00eda (UTFSM), Valpara\u00edso, Chile.","For a total period of eight months within 2006\u20132008, he was with the Institute of Power Electronics and Electrical Drives, University of Stuttgart, Germany.

Four environments were considered: a campus, a highway, a suburban area, and an urban area. Since the scattering environment may rapidly change in V2V communications, we first investigate the validity of the wide-sense stationarity (WSS) assumption for such channels using the correlation matrix distance (CMD), which is a metric for the characterization of the MIMO channel nonstationarity. Moreover, statistical channel models were developed for these environments, which take into account the non-stationary behavior of the measured V2V channels. The large-scale fading was found to be lognormally distributed, whereas the small-scale fading was characterized by the flexible Weibull distribution. Finally, the non-stationary behavior of both large-scale fading and small-scale fading statistics was investigated.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 January 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5393069/","volume":"59","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/5393069/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11285972","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May 2010","dateOfInsertion":"27 May 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Non-Stationary Narrowband MIMO Inter-Vehicle Channel Characterization in the 5-GHz Band","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Non-Stationary Narrowband MIMO Inter-Vehicle Channel Characterization in the 5-GHz Band","sourcePdf":"tvt-renaudin-2040851.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.081593S","chronDate":"May  2010","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"5463253","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"86","xplore-issue":"5463253","articleId":"5393069","onlineDate":"19 January 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5393072,"authors":[{"name":"Kia C.

Current standard emission limits were developed to protect amplitude- and frequency-modulated analog radio services. However, developments in digital technology require emission limits adapted to protect digital radio communication services. An approach to define emission limits on the amplitude probability distribution (APD) of the envelope of an interference source has been presented earlier. This approach is derived for coherent radio receivers utilizing no error-correction codes. However, since the most important digital radio systems today use error correction, it is necessary to develop the method to handle coded systems as well. This paper proposes a method to define emission limits on the APD of the interference to protect coded communication systems. The method is a further development of previously proposed emission limits derived for an uncoded system, which is modified in accordance with the coding gain.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5415790","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TEMC.2009.2037217","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electromagnetic Compatibility","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electromagnetic Compatibility","pdfPath":"/iel5/15/5415790/05393072.pdf","startPage":"223","endPage":"229","doi":"10.1109/TEMC.2009.2037217","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Approach to Using Amplitude Probability Distribution for Emission Limits to Protect Digital Radio Receivers Using Error-Correction Codes","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2010","displayDocTitle":"An Approach to Using Amplitude Probability Distribution for Emission Limits to Protect Digital Radio Receivers Using Error-Correction Codes","volume":"52","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/5393072/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2010","accessionNumber":"11149534","dateOfInsertion":"17 February 2010","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5393072/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 January 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Approach to Using Amplitude Probability Distribution for Emission Limits to Protect Digital Radio Receivers Using Error-Correction Codes","sourcePdf":"temc-wiklundh-2037217.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.050586S","chronDate":"Feb.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"15","isNumber":"5415790","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"15","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"5415790","articleId":"5393072","onlineDate":"19 January 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-22"},{"_id":5393073,"authors":[{"name":"Emmanuel Perrin","affiliation":["XLIM Research Institute, Limoges, France","Dassault Aviation Company, Saint-Cloud, France"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/15/5415790/5393073/5393073-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Emmanuel Perrin was born in La Chatre, France, in 1983.

In this paper, we suggest a new way to improve the efficiency of the FDTD method, especially for LF problems such as lightning indirect effects studies. The procedure consists in first calculating the system's response to a quasi-impulse excitation. The quasi-impulse response is extrapolated using the matrix pencil method in order to obtain a totally damped waveform. Next, the system's transfer function is calculated and the response to any excitation is deduced. Thus, this method allows for solving problems with a slow response. For instance, the tool is used to calculate currents induced on wires inside a composite aircraft struck by lightning. Very good agreements with FDTD complete simulations are found. Furthermore, the method allows an important computation time saving.","doi":"10.1109/TEMC.2009.2038064","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electromagnetic Compatibility","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electromagnetic Compatibility","pdfPath":"/iel5/15/5415790/05393073.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TEMC.2009.2038064","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5415790","startPage":"173","endPage":"178","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Using Transfer Function Calculation and Extrapolation to Improve the Efficiency of the Finite-Difference Time-Domain Method at Low Frequencies","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5393073","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Using Transfer Function Calculation and Extrapolation to Improve the Efficiency of the Finite-Difference Time-Domain Method at Low Frequencies","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5393073/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 January 2010","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"52","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Feb. 2010","accessionNumber":"11149525","dateOfInsertion":"17 February 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5393073/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Using Transfer Function Calculation and Extrapolation to Improve the Efficiency of the Finite-Difference Time-Domain Method at Low Frequencies","sourcePdf":"temc-perrin-2038064.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.068615S","chronDate":"Feb.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"15","isNumber":"5415790","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"15","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"5415790","articleId":"5393073","onlineDate":"19 January 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5393074,"authors":[{"name":"Iurie Axente","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Western Ontario, London, ONT, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/5463201/5393074/5393074-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Iurie Axente received the B.Sc. degree from the Technical University of Moldova, Chisinau, Moldova, in 1993, the M.Sc. degree from the Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, Sweden, in 2002, and the Ph.D. degree from Dublin Institute of Technology, Dublin, Ireland, in 2008, all in electrical engineering.","From 1993 to 1998, he was a Teaching Assistant and an Assistant Lecturer at the Technical University of Moldova.

The delay problem in the digital controller is overcome by application of a fast DSP, a compact control technique and proper flow of control steps in the DSP software. A phase-locked loop-less software grid synchronization method has been implemented for the effective operation of the UPQC under conditions of grid frequency variation.

The proposed tuning techniques are based on the insertion of nonlinear (NL) blocks in the analog control loop and the generation of a controlled oscillation on the output voltage, in order to measure the closed-loop properties like gain margin, phase margin, and crossover frequency and to tune the analog controller according to the desired specifications. The NL blocks are based either on the \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">NL gain</i>\n or \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">NL phase</i>\n. The most relevant properties are as follows: 1) the oscillation amplitude is controlled by the NL action during the tuning procedure; 2) A/D converters are not required; 3) the parameter variations can be obtained with ancillary analog blocks (variable gain operational transconductance amplifier, switched capacitors, etc.); and 4) the tuning digital control algorithm is simple. Experimental results on a 10 A, 1.5 V point-of-load converter, where the controller tuning has been implemented using components off-the-shelf and a field-programmable gate array are provided to show the properties of the proposed system.","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2010.2041011","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/63/5492306/05393075.pdf","startPage":"2170","endPage":"2178","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2010.2041011","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5492306","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Simple Digital Autotuning For Analog Controller in SMPS","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5393075","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 January 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5393075/","displayDocTitle":"A Simple Digital Autotuning For Analog Controller in SMPS","volume":"25","issue":"8","publicationDate":"Aug. 2010","accessionNumber":"11416135","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5393075/","dateOfInsertion":"15 July 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Simple Digital Autotuning For Analog Controller in SMPS","sourcePdf":"tpel-mattavelli-2041011-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.063359S","chronDate":"Aug.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"5492306","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"5492306","articleId":"5393075","onlineDate":"19 January 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5393079,"authors":[{"name":"Nam H.

In this methodology, nonlinear-programming models are constructed on the basis of the concepts of the relative-closeness coefficient and the weighted-Euclidean distance. Simpler auxiliary nonlinear-programming models are further deduced to calculate relative-closeness of IF sets of alternatives to the IVIF-positive ideal solution, which can be used to generate the ranking order of alternatives. The proposed methodology is validated and compared with other similar methods.

Finally, we have applied this method to estimate sea-surface height from one flight experiment in the North Sea off the coast of Norway.","doi":"10.1109/TGRS.2009.2036721","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel5/36/5437364/05393092.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5437364","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2009.2036721","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","startPage":"2119","endPage":"2127","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Altimetric Analysis of the Sea-Surface GPS-Reflected Signals","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5393092","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 January 2010","displayDocTitle":"Altimetric Analysis of the Sea-Surface GPS-Reflected Signals","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5393092/","volume":"48","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/5393092/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2010","accessionNumber":"11204354","dateOfInsertion":"22 March 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Altimetric Analysis of the Sea-Surface GPS-Reflected Signals","sourcePdf":"tgrs-rius-2036721.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.061351S","chronDate":"April  2010","xplore-pub-id":"36","isNumber":"5437364","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"124","xplore-issue":"5437364","articleId":"5393092","onlineDate":"19 January 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5393093,"authors":[{"name":"Mar\u00eda Jos\u00e9 Gacto","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Ja\u00e9n, Ja\u00e9n, Spain"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/91/5475389/5393093/5393093-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Mar\u00eda Jos\u00e9 Gacto received the M.Sc. degree in computer science from the University of Granada, Granada, Spain, in 1999.","She is currently with the Intelligent Systems and Data Mining Research Group, Department of Computer Science, University of Ja\u00e9n, Ja\u00e9n, Spain.

The proposed index is the aggregation of three metrics that preserve the original meanings of the MFs as much as possible while a tuning of their definition parameters is performed. Additionally, rule-selection mechanisms can be used to reduce the model complexity, which involves another important interpretability aspect. To this end, we propose a postprocessing multiobjective evolutionary algorithm that performs rule selection and tuning of fuzzy-rule-based systems with three objectives: accuracy, semantic interpretability maximization, and complexity minimization. We tested our approach on nine real-world regression datasets. In order to analyze the interaction between the fuzzy-rule-selection approach and the tuning approach, these are also individually proved in a multiobjective framework and compared with their respective single-objective counterparts. We compared the different approaches by applying nonparametric statistical tests for pairwise and multiple comparisons, taking into consideration three representative points from the obtained Pareto fronts in the case of the multiobjective-based approaches. Results confirm the effectiveness of our approach, and a wide range of solutions is obtained, which are not only more interpretable but are also more accurate.","doi":"10.1109/TFUZZ.2010.2041008","pdfPath":"/iel5/91/5475389/05393093.pdf","startPage":"515","endPage":"531","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TFUZZ.2010.2041008","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5475389","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Integration of an Index to Preserve the Semantic Interpretability in the Multiobjective Evolutionary Rule Selection and Tuning of Linguistic Fuzzy Systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5393093/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 January 2010","displayDocTitle":"Integration of an Index to Preserve the Semantic Interpretability in the Multiobjective Evolutionary Rule Selection and Tuning of Linguistic Fuzzy Systems","volume":"18","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"01 June 2010","accessionNumber":"11328225","publicationDate":"June 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5393093/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Integration of an Index to Preserve the Semantic Interpretability in the Multiobjective Evolutionary Rule Selection and Tuning of Linguistic Fuzzy Systems","sourcePdf":"tfuzz-alcala-2041008.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.161786S","chronDate":"June  2010","xplore-pub-id":"91","isNumber":"5475389","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"91","citationCount":"120","xplore-issue":"5475389","articleId":"5393093","onlineDate":"19 January 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-02"},{"_id":5393161,"authors":[{"name":"Klemen Dezelak","affiliation":["Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of Maribor, Maribor, Slovenia"],"firstName":"Klemen","lastName":"Dezelak","id":"38111094000"},{"name":"Joze Pihler","affiliation":["Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of Maribor, Maribor, Slovenia"],"firstName":"Joze","lastName":"Pihler","id":"37297261100"},{"name":"Gorazd Stumberger","affiliation":["Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of Maribor, Maribor, Slovenia"],"firstName":"Gorazd","lastName":"Stumberger","id":"37374355400"},{"name":"Beno Klopcic","affiliation":["Indramat elekromotorji d. o. o, Skofja Loka, Slovenia"],"firstName":"Beno","lastName":"Klopcic","id":"38111101400"},{"name":"Drago Dolinar","affiliation":["Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of Maribor, Maribor, Slovenia"],"firstName":"Drago","lastName":"Dolinar","id":"37284196800"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9464"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0069"}],"articleNumber":"5393161","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":11,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":541},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Magnetics Society","url":"http://www.ieeemagnetics.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5393161","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Artificial neural networks","Magnetization","Magnetic cores","Circuit faults","Rectifiers","Spot welding","Inverters","Diodes","Protection","Magnetic switching"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["magnetisation","transformer cores","transformers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["artificial neural network","magnetization level","magnetic core","welding transformer","saturation detection","middle-frequency direct current resistance spot welding system","input rectifier","dc bus voltage","full-wave rectifier","unbalanced resistances","output rectifier diodes"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Detectors","hysteresis","neural network applications","transformers","welding"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TMAG.2009.2031976","pdfPath":"/iel5/20/5393096/05393161.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","startPage":"634","endPage":"637","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5393096","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMAG.2009.2031976","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Artificial Neural Network Applied for Detection of Magnetization Level in the Magnetic Core of a Welding Transformer","abstract":"This paper deals with the detection of saturation in the magnetic core of a welding transformer which is a part of a middle-frequency direct current (MFDC) resistance spot welding system (RSWS). It consists of an input rectifier, which produces dc bus voltage, an inverter, a welding transformer, and a full-wave rectifier that is mounted on the output of a transformer. During normal RSWS operation welding transformer's magnetic core can become saturated due to the unbalanced resistances of both transformer secondary windings and different characteristics of output rectifier diodes, which causes current spikes and over-current protection switch-off of the entire system. In order to prevent saturation of the transformer magnetic core, the RSWS control must detect that the magnetic core is approaching the saturated region. The aim of this paper is to present a reliable method for detection of magnetic core saturation that does not require an additional sensor. It is based on the artificial neural network (ANN). Its input is the measured primary current of the welding transformer. The applied ANN is trained to recognize the waveform of the current spikes in the primary current caused by the magnetic core saturation, which is used for magnetization level detection.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5393161/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 January 2010","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11071481","volume":"46","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/5393161/","publicationDate":"Feb. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Artificial Neural Network Applied for Detection of Magnetization Level in the Magnetic Core of a Welding Transformer","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Artificial Neural Network Applied for Detection of Magnetization Level in the Magnetic Core of a Welding Transformer","sourcePdf":"tmag-kdezelak-2031976.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.074335S","chronDate":"Feb.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"20","isNumber":"5393096","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"20","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"5393096","articleId":"5393161","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":5393221,"authors":[{"name":"Sang-in Park","affiliation":["Department of Automotive Engineering School of Mechanical Engineering, Hanyang University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Sang-in","lastName":"Park","id":"37657119600"},{"name":"Seungjae Min","affiliation":["Department of Automotive Engineering School of Mechanical Engineering, Hanyang University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Seungjae","lastName":"Min","id":"37404032600"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9464"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0069"}],"articleNumber":"5393221","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":40,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":841},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Magnetics Society","url":"http://www.ieeemagnetics.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Actuators","Magnetic materials","Topology","Design optimization","Magnetostatics","Saturation magnetization","Transient analysis","Optimization methods","Magnetic fields","Finite element methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["air gaps","electromagnetic actuators","ferromagnetic materials","finite element analysis","magnetostatics","topology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["magnetic actuator","nonlinear ferromagnetic materials","level set based topology optimization","magnetic saturation","magnetic energy","air gap","nonlinear magnetostatic finite element analysis","eddy current effects"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Finite element method","level set method","magnetic actuator","nonlinear ferromagnetic material","topology optimization"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5393221","abstract":"In the practical design of magnetic actuators, the effect of magnetic saturation usually plays an important role.

The proposed model is based on the finite-element method and takes into account the \u00bfskin effect\u00bf impact on the individual conductor resistances and self inductances. Because of mutual inductive coupling between the parallel windings, electromagnetic forces will cause a nonuniform current distribution in parallel windings. An illustrative example is investigated and uniform configuration is considered for the parallel windings. The obtained numerical results show the current distribution in parallel windings is not uniform in this case.

Here, a clutter signal spread in Doppler frequency due to propagation via a disturbed ionospheric layer competes with a target and narrowband clutter returns propagating via a stable ionospheric layer with the same group delay (radar range). Mitigation over all ranges of spread clutter propagating via a \u00bfmixed mode\u00bf path with indistinguishable direction-of-arrival (DoA) relative to the target requires (potentially adaptive) transmit beamforming to exploit the direction-of-departure (DoD) difference, which varies as a function of radar range.

Ongoing work on this topic has suggested that benign and malignant masses, which usually possess remarkable architectural differences, could be distinguished by exploiting their morphology-dependent UWB microwave backscatter. We have previously approached this problem by deriving the complex natural resonances of the late-time target response, where the damping factors vary with the border profiles of anomalies. In this paper, we investigate the potential advantage of MIMO radar to enhance the resonance scattering phenomenon in breast tissue discrimination. MIMO radar can choose freely the probing signals transmitted via its antennas to exploit the independence between signals at the array elements, thereby enhancing the performance of target classification. Based on the observed damping factors and the receiver operating characteristics at different classifiers, which correspond to various diversity paths in the MIMO radar system, two data-fusion rules are proposed for robust lesion differentiation. Finally, numerical examples are provided to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed imaging technique.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multiple-Input Multiple-Output Radar for Lesion Classification in Ultrawideband Breast Imaging","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/JSTSP.2009.2038975","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4200690/5393279/05393287.pdf","startPage":"187","endPage":"201","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSTSP.2009.2038975","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5393279","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5393287","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5393287/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 January 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2010","displayDocTitle":"Multiple-Input Multiple-Output Radar for Lesion Classification in Ultrawideband Breast Imaging","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"4","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/5393287/","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2010","publicationDate":"Feb. 2010","accessionNumber":"11071239","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multiple-Input Multiple-Output Radar for Lesion Classification in Ultrawideband Breast Imaging","sourcePdf":"04jstsp01-ychen-2038975.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.107324S","chronDate":"Feb.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"4200690","isNumber":"5393279","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4200690","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"5393279","articleId":"5393287","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5393288,"authors":[{"name":"Ali Tajer","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, Columbia University, NY, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4200690/5393279/5393288/5393288-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Ali Tajer (S'05) received the B.Sc. and M.Sc. degrees in electrical engineering from Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Iran, in 2002 and 2004, respectively.

In this paper, as the parameter of interest we focus on the vector of time-delays that the waveforms undergo from being emitted by the transmit antennas until being observed by the receive antennas. The analytical and empirical results establish that for the proposed joint target detection and time-delay estimation framework, MIMO radars exhibit significant gains over phased-array radars for extended targets which consist of multiple independent scatterers.

Statistical MIMO radars exploit angular diversity to mitigate the impact of radar cross section (RCS) fluctuations. The fluctuations can be modeled with the Swerling scattering model consisting of four different cases with either fast or slow target RCS fluctuations. In this paper, the performance of different statistical MIMO radar configurations is compared in the different Swerling cases. Both target detection and direction of arrival estimation tasks are considered. We derive the optimal test statistics for target detection for non-orthogonal waveforms in all the Swerling cases in single-pulse as well as multi-pulse scenarios. We derive a closed-form density function for the test statistics under null and alternate hypotheses in the Swerling cases 1 and 2. For orthogonal waveforms in cases 3 and 4, the density function is given as a convolution involving a transcendental function. A suboptimal detector having a closed-form density function in cases 3 and 4 when the waveforms are orthogonal is introduced as well. In the direction finding task, confidence bounds of the squared estimation error of the different configurations are compared.

A HMPAR comprises a large number, MP, of T/R elements, organized into M subarrays of P elements each. Within each subarray, passive element-level phase shifting is used to steer transmit and receive beams in some desired fashion. Each of the M subarrays are in turn driven by independently amplified phase-coded signals which could be quasi-orthogonal, phase-coherent, or partially correlated. Such a radar system could be used in an airborne platform for concurrent search, detect, and track missions. This paper considers various signaling strategies which could be employed in the notional HMPAR architecture to achieve various objectives quantified by transmit beampatterns and space-time ambiguity functions. First, we propose a method to generate multiple correlated signals for uniform linear and rectangular arrays that achieve arbitrary rectangular transmit beampatterns in one and two dimensions, while maintaining desirable temporal properties. Examples of the range of transmit beampatterns possible with this technique are illustrated for an array of MP=900 elements, arranged using different values of M and P. Then the space-time, or MIMO, ambiguity function that is appropriate for the HMPAR radar system is derived. Examples of ambiguity functions for our signals using a one-dimensional HMPAR architecture are given, demonstrating that one can achieve phased-array-like resolution on receive, for arbitrary transmit beampatterns.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4200690/5393279/05393290.pdf","startPage":"66","endPage":"78","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/JSTSP.2009.2038968","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSTSP.2009.2038968","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5393279","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5393290","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Signaling Strategies for the Hybrid MIMO Phased-Array Radar","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Phased arrays","Radar signal processing","Signal processing","Radar antennas","Sensor arrays","Radar tracking","Signal generators","Digital signal processing","Apertures"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","MIMO radar","phased array radar","radar signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hybrid MIMO phased array radar","multisensor radar","multiple input multiple output radar","signaling strategy","space-time ambiguity functions","multiple correlated signal","linear arrays","rectangular arrays","phased-array-like resolution"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Ambiguity function","beam pattern synthesis","constant modulus waveforms","multiple-input multiple output (MIMO) radar","orthogonal signals","phased array radar","radar signal processing"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5393290/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 January 2010","displayDocTitle":"Signaling Strategies for the Hybrid MIMO Phased-Array Radar","volume":"4","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/5393290/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2010","accessionNumber":"11071242","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Signaling Strategies for the Hybrid MIMO Phased-Array Radar","sourcePdf":"jstsp-rangaswamy-2038968.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.078151S","chronDate":"Feb.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"4200690","isNumber":"5393279","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4200690","citationCount":"97","xplore-issue":"5393279","articleId":"5393290","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5393291,"authors":[{"name":"Qian He","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, University of Electronic Science and Technology, Chengdu, Sichuan, China","Lehigh University, Bethlehem, PA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4200690/5393279/5393291/5393291-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Qian He (S'09) received the B.Eng. degree in electronic engineering from the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC), Chengdu, in 2004.

Existing approaches to dealing with moving targets in SAR solve the nonlinear problem of target scattering and motion estimation typically through decoupled matched filtering. In contrast, by using an overcomplete dictionary approach we effectively linearize the forward model and solve the moving target problem as a larger, unified regularized inversion problem subject to sparsity constraints. This unified framework allows estimation of scatter motion and reflectivity to be done in an optimal and global way. We show examples of the potential of the new method for sensing configurations with transmitters and receivers randomly dispersed in a multi-static geometry within a narrow forward cone around the scene of interest.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Imaging of Moving Targets With Multi-Static SAR Using an Overcomplete Dictionary","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/JSTSP.2009.2038982","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4200690/5393279/05393294.pdf","startPage":"164","endPage":"176","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSTSP.2009.2038982","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5393279","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5393294","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5393294/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 January 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2010","displayDocTitle":"Imaging of Moving Targets With Multi-Static SAR Using an Overcomplete Dictionary","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"4","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/5393294/","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2010","publicationDate":"Feb. 2010","accessionNumber":"11071245","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Imaging of Moving Targets With Multi-Static SAR Using an Overcomplete Dictionary","sourcePdf":"04jstsp01-istojanovic-2038982.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.098246S","chronDate":"Feb.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"4200690","isNumber":"5393279","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4200690","citationCount":"73","xplore-issue":"5393279","articleId":"5393294","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5393295,"authors":[{"name":"William Roberts","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4200690/5393279/5393295/5393295-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["William Roberts (S'09) received the B.S. and M.Sc. degrees in electrical engineering from the University of Florida, Gainesville, in 2006 and 2007, respectively, where he is currently working towards the Ph.D. degree in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering.","His research interests include statistical signal processing and radar signal processing."]},"firstName":"William","lastName":"Roberts","id":"37589302000"},{"name":"Petre Stoica","affiliation":["Department of Information Technology, University of Uppsala, Uppsala, Sweden"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4200690/5393279/5393295/5393295-photo-2-source-small.gif","p":["Petre Stoica (F'94) received the D.Sc. degree in automatic control from the Polytechnic Institute of Bucharest (BPI), Bucharest, Romania, in 1979 and an honorary doctorate degree in science from Uppsala University (UU), Uppsala, Sweden, in 1993.","He is currently a Professor of systems modeling with the Division of Systems and Control, the Department of Information Technology at UU.

When a MIMO radar transmits orthogonal waveforms, the reflected signals from scatterers are linearly independent of each other. Therefore, adaptive receive filters, such as Capon and amplitude and phase estimation (APES) filters, can be directly employed in MIMO radar applications. High levels of noise and strong clutter, however, significantly worsen detection performance of the data-dependent beamformers due to a shortage of snapshots. The iterative adaptive approach (IAA), a nonparametric and user parameter-free weighted least-squares algorithm, was recently shown to offer improved resolution and interference rejection performance in several passive and active sensing applications. In this paper, we show how IAA can be extended to MIMO radar imaging, in both the negligible and nonnegligible intrapulse Doppler cases, and we also establish some theoretical convergence properties of IAA. In addition, we propose a regularized IAA algorithm, referred to as IAA-R, which can perform better than IAA by accounting for unrepresented additive noise terms in the signal model. Numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the superior performance of MIMO radar over single-input multiple-output (SIMO) radar, and further highlight the improved performance achieved with the proposed IAA-R method for target imaging.","doi":"10.1109/JSTSP.2009.2038964","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4200690/5393279/05393295.pdf","startPage":"5","endPage":"20","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5393279","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSTSP.2009.2038964","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Iterative Adaptive Approaches to MIMO Radar Imaging","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5393295","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2010","displayDocTitle":"Iterative Adaptive Approaches to MIMO Radar Imaging","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5393295/","publicationDate":"Feb. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2010","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"11071246","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5393295/","volume":"4","issue":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 January 2010","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Iterative Adaptive Approaches to MIMO Radar Imaging","sourcePdf":"04jstsp01-jli-2038964.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.08831S","chronDate":"Feb.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"4200690","isNumber":"5393279","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4200690","citationCount":"151","xplore-issue":"5393279","articleId":"5393295","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5393297,"authors":[{"name":"Hongbin Li","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Stevens Institute of Technology, Hoboken, NJ, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4200690/5393279/5393297/5393297-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Hongbin Li (M'99\u2013SM'08) received the B.S. and M.S. degrees from the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, in 1991 and 1994, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree from the University of Florida, Gainesville, in 1999, all in electrical engineering.","From July 1996 to May 1999, he was a Research Assistant in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Florida.

The proposed scheme divides the transmit array elements into multiple groups, each group forms a directional beam and modulates a distinct waveform, and all beams are steerable and point to the same direction. The resulting system is referred to as a TS-MIMO radar. A TS-MIMO radar is a tunable system that offers a continuum of operating modes from the phased-array radar, which achieves the maximum directional gain but the least interference rejection ability, to the omnidirectional transmission based MIMO radar, which can handle the largest number of interference sources but offers no directional gain. Tuning of the TS-MIMO system can be easily made by changing the configuration of the transmit subapertures, which provides a direct tradeoff between the directional gain and interference rejection power of the system. The performance of the TS-MIMO radar is examined in terms of the output signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) of an adaptive beamformer in an interference and training limited environment, where we show analytically how the output SINR is affected by several key design parameters, including the size/number of the subapertures and the number of training signals. Our results are verified by computer simulation and comparisons are made among various operating modes of the proposed TS-MIMO system.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4200690/5393279/05393297.pdf","startPage":"55","endPage":"65","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/JSTSP.2009.2038967","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSTSP.2009.2038967","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5393279","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5393297","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Transmit Subaperturing for MIMO Radars With Co-Located Antennas","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Radar antennas","Transmitting antennas","Interference","Signal to noise ratio","Optical modulation","Signal analysis","Performance analysis","Signal design","Computer simulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna phased arrays","array signal processing","MIMO radar","phased array radar","radar antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["transmit subaperturing aaproach","TS-MIMO radar","colocated antenna","multiple-input multiple-output radar","directional beam","phased-array radar","signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio","SINR","adaptive beamformer"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Adaptive processing for multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) radars","MIMO radars","subaperture","transmit beamforming"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5393297/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 January 2010","displayDocTitle":"Transmit Subaperturing for MIMO Radars With Co-Located Antennas","volume":"4","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/5393297/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2010","accessionNumber":"11071248","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Transmit Subaperturing for MIMO Radars With Co-Located Antennas","sourcePdf":"04jstsp01-hli-2038967.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.059027S","chronDate":"Feb.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"4200690","isNumber":"5393279","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4200690","citationCount":"110","xplore-issue":"5393279","articleId":"5393297","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5393298,"authors":[{"name":"Christian R.

New digital signals, like digital audio/video broadcast (DAB/DVB), are excellent candidates for this scheme, as they are widely available, can be easily decoded to acquire the noise-free signal, and employ orthogonal frequency division multiplex (OFDM). Multicarrier transmission schemes like OFDM use block channel equalization in the frequency domain, efficiently implemented as a fast Fourier transform, and these channel estimates can directly be used to identify targets based on Fourier analysis across subsequent blocks. In this paper, we derive the exact matched filter formulation for passive radar using OFDM waveforms. We then show that the current approach using Fourier analysis across block channel estimates is equivalent to the matched filter, based on a piecewise constant assumption on the Doppler-induced phase rotation in the time domain. We next present high-resolution algorithms based on the same assumption: first we implement MUSIC as a 2-D spectral estimator using spatial smoothing; then we use the new concept of compressed sensing to identify targets. We compare the new algorithms and the current approach using numerical simulation and experimental data recorded from a DAB network in Germany.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5393298/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 January 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2010","volume":"4","issue":"1","accessionNumber":"11071249","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2010","publicationDate":"Feb. 2010","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Signal Processing for Passive Radar Using OFDM Waveforms","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Signal Processing for Passive Radar Using OFDM Waveforms","sourcePdf":"04jstsp01-cberger-2038977.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.079426S","chronDate":"Feb.  2010","isNumber":"5393279","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4200690","citationCount":"231","articleId":"5393298","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5393299,"authors":[{"name":"Chin Yuan Chong","affiliation":["SONDRA, Sup\u00e9lec, Gif-sur-Yvette, France","DSO National Laboratories, Singapore"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4200690/5393279/5393299/5393299-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Chin Yuan Chong (S'09) received the M.Sc. degree in electrical engineering from Lund University, Lund, Sweden in 2005.

The GLRT-LQ detector has been derived based on the spherically invariant random vector (SIRV) model and is constant false alarm rate (CFAR) with respect to the clutter power fluctuations (also known as the texture). The new MIMO detector is then shown to be texture-CFAR as well. The theoretical performance of this new detector is first analytically derived and then validated using Monte Carlo simulations. Its detection performance is then compared to that of the well-known Optimum Gaussian Detector (OGD) under Gaussian and non-Gaussian clutter. Next, the adaptive version of the detector is investigated. The covariance matrix is estimated using the Fixed Point (FP) algorithm which enables the detector to remain texture- and matrix-CFAR. The effects of the estimation of the covariance matrix on the detection performance are also investigated.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"MIMO Radar Detection in Non-Gaussian and Heterogeneous Clutter","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/JSTSP.2009.2038980","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4200690/5393279/05393299.pdf","startPage":"115","endPage":"126","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSTSP.2009.2038980","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5393279","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5393299","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5393299/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 January 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2010","displayDocTitle":"MIMO Radar Detection in Non-Gaussian and Heterogeneous Clutter","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"4","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/5393299/","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2010","publicationDate":"Feb. 2010","accessionNumber":"11071250","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"MIMO Radar Detection in Non-Gaussian and Heterogeneous Clutter","sourcePdf":"jstsp-chong-2038980.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.130085S","chronDate":"Feb.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"4200690","isNumber":"5393279","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4200690","citationCount":"80","xplore-issue":"5393279","articleId":"5393299","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5393302,"authors":[{"name":"Jian Li","affiliation":["University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4200690/5393279/5393302/5393302-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jian Li (S'87\u2013M'91\u2013SM'97\u2013F'05) received the M.Sc. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from The Ohio State University, Columbus, in 1987 and 1991, respectively.","From July 1991 to June 1993, she was an Assistant Professor with the Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Kentucky, Lexington.

The proposed method determines the optimum settings of reactive power control variables such as, generator excitation, tap changing transformers, and shunt compensation that reduces the power loss, while maintaining the voltage stability.

Linear approaches could be effective for some simple cases with slowly varying noises, but not for other slowly varying noise cases and rapidly varying noise cases. As a nonlinear wavelet based technique, the wavelet thresholding is effective to denoise blurring aerial images. Either the discrete wavelet transform or wavelet packets technique can be employed using wavelet decomposition. At each level of wavelet decompositions, the digital image is split into four subbands, representing approximation (low frequency feature) and three details (high frequency features) in horizontal, vertical and diagonal directions. The proposed soft thresholding wavelet decomposition at multiple levels is a simple and efficient method for reduction of noises. For multiple level decompositions in terms of both the discrete wavelet transform and wavelet packets techniques, the approximation component will always be decomposed at each level. If the detail components are further decomposed as well similar to that of the approximation, it is the wavelet packet approach, otherwise it is the discrete wavelet transform. On a basis of the proposed thresholding technique at different levels for wavelet denoising, objective metrics can be introduced also to evaluate and compare the denoising effects of the discrete wavelet transform and wavelet packets quantitatively rather than qualitative observation, such as the metrics of the discrete entropy, energy and mutual information.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Quantitative effects of discrete wavelet transforms and wavelet packets on aerial digital image denoising","publicationTitle":"2009 6th International Conference on Electrical Engineering, Computing Science and Automatic Control (CCE)","doi":"10.1109/ICEEE.2009.5393363","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 6th International Conference on Electrical Engineering, Computing Science and Automatic Control (CCE)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5374433/5393309/05393363.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICEEE.2009.5393363","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5393309","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5393363","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5393363/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-13 Jan. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Quantitative effects of discrete wavelet transforms and wavelet packets on aerial digital image denoising","conferenceDate":"10-13 Jan. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5393363/","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2010","publicationDate":"Nov. 2009","accessionNumber":"11086441","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Quantitative effects of discrete wavelet transforms and wavelet packets on aerial digital image denoising","confLoc":"Toluca, Mexico","sourcePdf":"49.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046832S","chronDate":"10-13 Jan. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5374433","isNumber":"5393309","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5374433","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5393309","articleId":"5393363","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":5393371,"authors":[{"name":"Anoj Kumar","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science & Engineering, MNNIT, Allahabad, India"],"lastName":"Anoj Kumar","id":"37087220580"},{"name":"K.

systems with sample-data outputs","abstract":"This paper addresses the problem of robust control for a class of nonlinear dynamical systems in the discrete-continuous time domain. We deal with nonlinear controllable models described by ordinary differential equations in the presence of bounded uncertainties. The full model of the control system under consideration is completed by linear sampling-type outputs. The linear feedback control design proposed in this manuscript is created by application of an extended version of the conventional invariant ellipsoid method. Moreover, we also apply some specific Lyapunov-based \"descriptor techniques\" from the stability theory of delayed systems. The above combination of the modified invariant ellipsoid approach and descriptor method make it possible to obtain the robustness of the designed control and to establish some well known stability properties of dynamical systems under consideration. Finally, the applicability of the proposed method is illustrated by a computational example. A brief discussion on the main implementation issue is also included.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5393420/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-13 Jan. 2009","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"10-13 Jan. 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5393420/","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2010","publicationDate":"Nov. 2009","accessionNumber":"11119099","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Robust control for a class of continuous-time dynamical systems with sample-data outputs","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust control for a class of continuous-time dynamical systems with sample-data outputs","confLoc":"Toluca, Mexico","sourcePdf":"170.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064794S","chronDate":"10-13 Jan. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5374433","isNumber":"5393309","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5374433","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"5393309","articleId":"5393420","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5393437,"authors":[{"name":"Leonardo G.

Each island of the PGA had different parameters and we established a fixed migration policy for all islands. Experiments were done and average results were reported. The effect of coevolution in PGAs was evidenced. The convergence time increased with the number of connections of the topology. The quality of solutions also increased in the same way. Although topologies with large connectivity increases the overall processing time, they take benefits to the quality of solutions found.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Topology","Genetic algorithms","Electronics packaging","Search methods","Bioinformatics","Laboratories","Traveling salesman problems","Evolutionary computation","Search problems","Genetic mutations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithms","topology","travelling salesman problems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["insular parallel genetic algorithm","traveling salesman problem","migration policy","topology connection"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5393306","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NABIC.2009.5393437","startPage":"632","endPage":"635","publicationTitle":"2009 World Congress on Nature & Biologically Inspired Computing (NaBIC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 World Congress on Nature & Biologically Inspired Computing (NaBIC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5377996/5393306/05393437.pdf","doi":"10.1109/NABIC.2009.5393437","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A study of topology in insular Parallel Genetic Algorithms","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A study of topology in insular Parallel Genetic Algorithms","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11088898","publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"9-11 Dec. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"22 January 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5393437/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5393437/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-11 Dec. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A study of topology in insular Parallel Genetic Algorithms","confLoc":"Coimbatore, India","sourcePdf":"rp106NABIC213.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044562S","chronDate":"9-11 Dec. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5377996","isNumber":"5393306","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5377996","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5393306","articleId":"5393437","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5393456,"authors":[{"name":"I.

Nevertheless there exist many sources of uncertainties around the aforementioned mathematical representation. It is well known that neural networks can approximate a large set of continuous functions defined on a compact set to an arbitrary accuracy. In this paper a strategy based on DNN for the non parametric identification of a mathematical model described by a class of two dimensional (2D) partial differential equations is proposed. The adaptive laws for weights ensure the \"practical stability\" of the DNN trajectories to the parabolic 2D-PDE states. To verify the qualitative behavior of the suggested methodology, here a non parametric modeling problem for a distributed parameter plant is analyzed.","doi":"10.1109/ICEEE.2009.5393456","pdfPath":"/iel5/5374433/5393309/05393456.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 6th International Conference on Electrical Engineering, Computing Science and Automatic Control (CCE)","publicationTitle":"2009 6th International Conference on Electrical Engineering, Computing Science and Automatic Control (CCE)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICEEE.2009.5393456","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5393309","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Neural network identification of uncertain 2D partial differential equations","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5393456/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-13 Jan. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Neural network identification of uncertain 2D partial differential equations","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2010","accessionNumber":"11119109","publicationDate":"Nov. 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5393456/","conferenceDate":"10-13 Jan. 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Neural network identification of uncertain 2D partial differential equations","confLoc":"Toluca, Mexico","sourcePdf":"134.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064746S","chronDate":"10-13 Jan. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5374433","isNumber":"5393309","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5374433","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5393309","articleId":"5393456","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5393475,"authors":[{"name":"J.

It is shown that this normalization technique saves up to 12% of the required storage in addition to saving hardware resources needed for the decoding operation. A speed efficient implementation for this normalization which reduces critical path delay up to 16.5% using redundant number system is proposed.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hardware","Iterative decoding","Turbo codes","Wireless communication","WiMAX","Concatenated codes","Probability","Switches","Microelectronics","Power engineering and energy"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["turbo codes","WiMax"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["double binary turbo decoder","interleaver implementation","normalization scheme","802.16e"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Turbo decoder","interleaver","metric normalization","efficient hardware"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICM.2008.5393498","publicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Microelectronics","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Microelectronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/5374439/5393492/05393498.pdf","startPage":"345","endPage":"348","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5393492","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICM.2008.5393498","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient hardware implementation for 802.16e double binary Turbo decoder","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5393498","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Efficient hardware implementation for 802.16e double binary Turbo decoder","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5393498/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5393498/","accessionNumber":"11087928","conferenceDate":"14-17 Dec. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"22 January 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-17 Dec. 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient hardware implementation for 802.16e double binary Turbo decoder","confLoc":"Sharjah, United Arab Emirates","sourcePdf":"1569136592.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.036622S","chronDate":"14-17 Dec. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"5374439","isNumber":"5393492","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5374439","xplore-issue":"5393492","articleId":"5393498","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5393500,"authors":[{"name":"Ziad El-Khatib","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and CPFR, Carleton University, Ottawa, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Ziad","lastName":"El-Khatib","id":"38274240100"},{"name":"Leonard MacEachern","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and CPFR, Carleton University, Ottawa, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Leonard","lastName":"MacEachern","id":"37269976500"},{"name":"Samy A.

However, due to the limited size of the hardware device in microelectronics technology, several constraints can be encountered to reach the real time processing since the application of the ICA algorithm requires the consumption of a huge number of input signal samples. Hence, the system performance was degraded since we required the processing of an important number of memory circuits with faster hardware execution time. Therefore, in order to improve the hardware performances of the device, the authors proposed the sequential processing of one neuron hardware model based on field programmable gate array (FPGA) implementation. Such approach overcomes the consumption resources and the interconnections complexities of the FPGA architecture. Thus, an optimal hardware design can be proposed in which a maximum number of samples can be handled while maintaining high speed of hardware processing time. The proposed approach was demonstrated through an experimental study of TIMIT database exhibiting a hardware execution time of 3.3 \u00bfs to process 10000 samples with 57 kHz of sample rates to separate two output independent signals from two input mixed signals.","publicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Microelectronics","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Microelectronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/5374439/5393492/05393506.pdf","startPage":"60","endPage":"63","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICM.2008.5393506","doi":"10.1109/ICM.2008.5393506","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5393492","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Digital circuit design for FPGA based implementation of ICA for real time Blind Signal Separation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Digital circuit design for FPGA based implementation of ICA for real time Blind Signal Separation","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5393506/","conferenceDate":"14-17 Dec. 2008","htmlLink":"/document/5393506/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"22 January 2010","publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","accessionNumber":"11133785","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-17 Dec. 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Digital circuit design for FPGA based implementation of ICA for real time Blind Signal Separation","confLoc":"Sharjah, United Arab Emirates","sourcePdf":"1569136440.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06031S","chronDate":"14-17 Dec. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"5374439","isNumber":"5393492","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5374439","xplore-issue":"5393492","articleId":"5393506","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5393512,"authors":[{"name":"Ziad El-Khatib","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and CPFR, Carleton University, Ottawa, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Ziad","lastName":"El-Khatib","id":"38274240100"},{"name":"Leonard MacEachern","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and CPFR, Carleton University, Ottawa, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Leonard","lastName":"MacEachern","id":"37269976500"},{"name":"Samy A.

Using a cascode current reuse structure with inter-stage inductors we achieved low power consumption and high power gain. We proved that the interstage inductors must be designed with a new method compared to newly published papers. This structure is based on two cascode configuration which provides a good output swing thus allowing the integration in low voltage technology. This configuration also permits good input impedance matching, low noise figure and high reverse isolation. Complete simulations of the circuit at 5.5-GHz center frequency, have shown that the circuit has 3.1dB NF, 1.2GHz 3dB power bandwidth, 20.63dB power gain (S21), high reverse isolation (S12)\u226a\u221245dB, \u221229.4dB input matching (S11), \u221225dB output matching (S22), and \u221215.9dBm 3rd order input intercept point (IIP3).

In this paper, some systematic procedures based on normal form (NF) theory are proposed for studying the influence of high order terms arising from the Taylor series expansion of the system model on power system dynamic behavior. Using this method, a third-order model of the power system is proposed in which weak system nonlinearities are explicitly represented. Analytical expressions are then developed that provide near approximate solutions to system performance. To check the validity of the frequency-change method, experiments were obtained using single-machine infinite-bus system using a classical representation. The purpose of these experiments is to find the phase difference between the classical model and the nonlinear equivalents.","doi":"10.1109/ICEEE.2009.5393566","publicationTitle":"2009 6th International Conference on Electrical Engineering, Computing Science and Automatic Control (CCE)","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 6th International Conference on Electrical Engineering, Computing Science and Automatic Control (CCE)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5374433/5393309/05393566.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICEEE.2009.5393566","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5393309","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Frequency-change analysis of nonlinear system using spectrum (Fast Fourier Transform) theory","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5393566","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-13 Jan. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5393566/","displayDocTitle":"Frequency-change analysis of nonlinear system using spectrum (Fast Fourier Transform) theory","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2009","accessionNumber":"11086472","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5393566/","conferenceDate":"10-13 Jan. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Frequency-change analysis of nonlinear system using spectrum (Fast Fourier Transform) theory","confLoc":"Toluca, Mexico","sourcePdf":"94.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054529S","chronDate":"10-13 Jan. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5374433","isNumber":"5393309","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5374433","xplore-issue":"5393309","articleId":"5393566","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5393579,"authors":[{"name":"Aditya Bir","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Mumbai, Mumbai, India"],"firstName":"Aditya","lastName":"Bir","id":"37064050900"},{"name":"Jyotsna Dongardive","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Mumbai, Mumbai, India"],"firstName":"Jyotsna","lastName":"Dongardive","id":"38111013400"},{"name":"Suruchi Jamkhedkar","affiliation":["Department of Life Sciences, Vidyanagari Campus, University of Mumbai, Mumbai, India"],"firstName":"Suruchi","lastName":"Jamkhedkar","id":"38111013300"},{"name":"Siby Abraham","affiliation":["Department of Mathematics and Statistics Statistics, G.

Further the problem is compounded when the distance relays are used for protection of double circuit transmission lines due to effect of zero sequence mutual coupling. Different types of faults on a protected transmission line should be located correctly. This paper presents a single neural network for fault distance location for all the ten types of faults (3 LG, 3 LLG, 3 LL, 1 LLL) in both the circuits of a double circuit transmission line fed from sources at both the end. This technique uses only one end data and accurate fault distance location is achieved after one cycle from the inception of fault. The proposed Artificial Neural Network (ANN) based Fault Distance Locator uses fundamental components of three phase current signals of both the circuits & three phase voltage signals to learn the hidden relationship in the input patterns. An improved performance is obtained once the neural network is trained suitably, thus performing correctly when faced with different system parameters and conditions i.e. varying fault type, fault

Fusion of visual and thermal images has been done to take the advantages of thermal images as well as visual images. By employing fusion a new image can be obtained, which provides the most detailed, reliable, and discriminating information. In this method fused images are generated using visual and thermal face images in the first step. In the second step, fused images are projected into eigenspace and finally classified using a radial basis function neural network. In the experiments Object Tracking and Classification Beyond Visible Spectrum (OTCBVS) database benchmark for thermal and visual face images have been used.

The PSO algorithm is implemented on three bus systems namely the 7, 14, 57 IEEE standard Bus systems. In this paper it has been proved that the placing of Phasor measurement units only at buses with the highest number of incident branches surely doesn't yield the optimal placement of the PMUs. This encouraged the idea of random placement of PMUs in the system and selection of the specific arrangement of PMUs which accomplished the task of complete observability of the system with minimum number of PMUs thus optimizing the PMU placement problem. The performance is compared with that of Adaptive GA, CLONALG and Adaptive CLONALG.

Processing jobs at the grid resources in a fine grained form results in a low computation - communication ratio. This necessitates the dynamic assembly of fine grained jobs into groups of jobs before dispatching them to the resources. Recent advances in computer and network technologies have led to parallel optimization algorithms. Here a novel job grouping method using Parallel Particle Swarm Optimization (PPSO) is proposed to reduce the communication overhead, enhance the speed of completion of processes, improve resource utilization, and parallel efficiency. The proposed approach uses PPSO to group the jobs and to submit them in parallel to the grid resources. Trust based parallel job submission is also proposed to ensure security and improve on job submission time. The proposed approach has been implemented and tested by extending the features of GridSim, a simulation toolkit for grid environment.","doi":"10.1109/NABIC.2009.5393664","pdfPath":"/iel5/5377996/5393306/05393664.pdf","startPage":"175","endPage":"180","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 World Congress on Nature & Biologically Inspired Computing (NaBIC)","publicationTitle":"2009 World Congress on Nature & Biologically Inspired Computing (NaBIC)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NABIC.2009.5393664","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5393306","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Load balanced, efficient scheduling with parallel job submission in computational grids using parallel particle swarm optimization","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5393664/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-11 Dec. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Load balanced, efficient scheduling with parallel job submission in computational grids using parallel particle swarm optimization","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"22 January 2010","accessionNumber":"11088917","publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5393664/","conferenceDate":"9-11 Dec. 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Load balanced, efficient scheduling with parallel job submission in computational grids using parallel particle swarm optimization","confLoc":"Coimbatore, India","sourcePdf":"rp030NABIC277.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.123456S","chronDate":"9-11 Dec. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5377996","isNumber":"5393306","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5377996","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5393306","articleId":"5393664","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":5393665,"authors":[{"name":"Abdul Jaleel Abdul Nazir","affiliation":["College of Engineering Trivandrum, Thiruvananthapuram, Kerala, IN"],"firstName":"Abdul Jaleel Abdul","lastName":"Nazir","id":"37087424149"},{"name":"Gautham","affiliation":["Dept. of Electronics & communication, College of Engineering, Trivandrum, Kerala, India"],"lastName":"Gautham","id":"38110965100"},{"name":"Remya Surajan","affiliation":["Dept. of Electronics & communication, College of Engineering, Trivandrum, Kerala, India"],"firstName":"Remya","lastName":"Surajan","id":"37087423202"},{"name":"L.S.

Recent researches have achieved big progresses in identifying and recognizing time-series patterns. And most of the recent works on time-series deal with this task by using static approaches and mainly focus on the recognition accuracy, but considering that recognition of patterns in financial time-series, especially for stock time-series, are always time-consuming rather than pattern recognition in other fields, a dynamic recognition approach is more preferable so that investment on stock pattern become executable. In this paper we propose a dynamic approach for extracting and recognizing the patterns in stock-series. In our approach a slide window with flexible length is defined for extracting feature vertexes in stock-series, and in addition, a dynamic perceptual important point (PIP) locating method is proposed based on the PIP locating method for avoiding the computation expense problem and an artificial neural network (ANN) approach is involved for pattern recognition and window length identification.","doi":"10.1109/NABIC.2009.5393674","startPage":"1552","endPage":"1555","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 World Congress on Nature & Biologically Inspired Computing (NaBIC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5377996/5393306/05393674.pdf","publicationTitle":"2009 World Congress on Nature & Biologically Inspired Computing (NaBIC)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NABIC.2009.5393674","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5393306","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A dynamic pattern recognition approach based on neural network for stock time-series","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Pattern recognition","Neural networks","Artificial neural networks","Pattern analysis","Investments","Feature extraction","Time series analysis","Shape","Algorithm design and analysis","Production systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neural nets","pattern recognition","stock markets","time series"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dynamic pattern recognition approach","artificial neural network","stock time series","pattern theorem","financial time series","technical analysis method","financial prediction","feature vertexes extraction","dynamic perceptual important point locating method"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["finacial time-series","stock series","dynamic approach","pattern recognition"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5393674/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-11 Dec. 2009","displayDocTitle":"A dynamic pattern recognition approach based on neural network for stock time-series","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5393674/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"22 January 2010","conferenceDate":"9-11 Dec. 2009","accessionNumber":"11134358","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A dynamic pattern recognition approach based on neural network for stock time-series","confLoc":"Coimbatore, India","sourcePdf":"rp271NABICS081.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052548S","chronDate":"9-11 Dec. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5377996","isNumber":"5393306","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5377996","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"5393306","articleId":"5393674","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5393679,"authors":[{"name":"Wael Abdulal","affiliation":["CSE Dept., Osmania University, Hyderabad, INDIA"],"firstName":"Wael","lastName":"Abdulal","id":"37601690700"},{"name":"Omar Al Jadaan","affiliation":["CSE Dept., Osmania University, Hyderabad, INDIA"],"firstName":"Omar Al","lastName":"Jadaan","id":"37682292900"},{"name":"Ahmad Jabas","affiliation":["CSE Dept., Osmania University, Hyderabad, INDIA"],"firstName":"Ahmad","lastName":"Jabas","id":"37601690500"},{"name":"S.

The modified algorithm speeds up convergence and shortens the search time more than IRRWSGA, at the same time the heuristic initialization of initial population using MCT algorithm allow the algorithm to obtain a high quality feasible scheduling solution. The simulation results, show that PRRWSGA has better search time than both IRRWSGA and standard genetic algorithms.

Constraints are protected areas inside the observed area where strength of electric field is limited because of a permanent people presence. In the observed area one wishes to obtain the strength of electric field which is higher than the lower limit value to cover the area with enough reception signal power. On the other hand electric field inside protected areas has to be lower than the prescribed upper limit determined by a health hazard. These two conditions are contradictory. In this investigation a genetic algorithm is used to find transmitter parameters (location, power and horizontal direction) constrained by above mentioned conditions. Investigation is limited to a rectangular planar observing area with one transmitter and with different formation and size of protected areas. The procedure has been repeated for 15 times and the results are analyzed statistically. Based on these results it can be concluded that the procedure is applicable and it is justified to continue investigations for more complex and more realistic situations, e.g. more than one transmitter with directed radiations and for 3D spaces.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-11 Dec. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5393683/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11088939","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5393683/","publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"22 January 2010","conferenceDate":"9-11 Dec. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Genetic algorithm based reduction of electromagnetic field pollution","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Genetic algorithm based reduction of electromagnetic field pollution","confLoc":"Coimbatore, India","sourcePdf":"rp261NABICS111.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04479S","chronDate":"9-11 Dec. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5377996","isNumber":"5393306","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5377996","xplore-issue":"5393306","articleId":"5393683","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5393690,"authors":[{"name":"Xin-She Yang","affiliation":["Department of Engineering, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK"],"firstName":"Xin-She","lastName":"Yang","id":"38104337900"},{"name":"Suash Deb","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science & Engineering, C.

This paper describes an algorithm to separate the lung tissue from a Chest CT to reduce the amount of data that needs to be analyzed. Our goal is to have a fully automatic algorithm for segmenting the lung tissue, and to separate the two lung sides as well. The image is thresholded to separate low-density tissue (lungs) from fat. Cleaning is performed to remove air, noise and airways. Finally, a sequence of morphological operations is used to smooth the irregular boundary. The database used for evaluation is taken from a radiology-teaching file. Our current evaluation shows that the applied segmentation algorithm works on a large number of different cases. The textural features were extracted from the segmented lungs and it was given as input to the BPN network.

This work aims at implementing SEMALRU-a semantic and least recently used Web cache replacement policy. The basic LRU replacement policy is augmented with semantic content of Web pages to improve the efficiency of the replacement algorithms in terms of hit rate and byte hit rate and to minimize the number of replacements made in cache. There are many well-known cache replacement policies based on size, recency, and frequency. This new improvised replacement policy attempts to implement cache replacement based on two parameters namely the semantics of the contents of Web pages and the time of last access of the document. SEMALRU evicts documents that are less related to an incoming document or least recently used document which needs to be stored in the cache. This makes sure that only related documents are stored in the cache; hence the contents of the cache represent the documents of interest to the user and then ranked by recency. This policy tunes the performance of the existing replacement algorithms through analyzing the semantic content of the document and the recency of the document. A detailed algorithm to identify unrelated documents and documents that are least recently used has been devised. The policy was tested in a simulated environment with the related and unrelated set of user access pattern. The parameters pertinent to cache replacement algorithms are computed and the results showing the improvement in the efficiency of the algorithm are furnished.","doi":"10.1109/NABIC.2009.5393711","publicationTitle":"2009 World Congress on Nature & Biologically Inspired Computing (NaBIC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 World Congress on Nature & Biologically Inspired Computing (NaBIC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5377996/5393306/05393711.pdf","startPage":"1406","endPage":"1410","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NABIC.2009.5393711","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5393306","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"SEMALRU: An Implementation of modified web cache replacement algorithm","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5393711/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-11 Dec. 2009","displayDocTitle":"SEMALRU: An Implementation of modified web cache replacement algorithm","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","accessionNumber":"11134420","htmlLink":"/document/5393711/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"22 January 2010","conferenceDate":"9-11 Dec. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"SEMALRU: An Implementation of modified web cache replacement algorithm","confLoc":"Coimbatore, India","sourcePdf":"rp241INC028.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068001S","chronDate":"9-11 Dec. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5377996","isNumber":"5393306","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5377996","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"5393306","articleId":"5393711","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5393716,"authors":[{"name":"K V Vinitha","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Cochin university of Science and Technology, Cochin, Kerala, India"],"firstName":"K V","lastName":"Vinitha","id":"37085899059"},{"name":"G Santhosh Kumar","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Cochin university of Science and Technology, Cochin, Kerala, India"],"firstName":"G Santhosh","lastName":"Kumar","id":"38236896100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5053-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5393716","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":242},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5393716","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Face recognition","Neural networks","Face detection","Hidden Markov models","Image segmentation","Facial features","Feature extraction","Lighting","Data mining","Principal component analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational geometry","face recognition","image matching","mesh generation","neural net architecture"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["face recognition","probabilistic neural networks","face detection","grey scale frontal view images","Voronoi/Delaunay tessellations","template matching","Voronoi diagram","face verification"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["voronoi / delaunay triangulation","ellipse fitting","template matching","cross correlation","edge gradients","peak to side lobe ratio","probabilistic radial basis neural networks"]}],"doi":"10.1109/NABIC.2009.5393716","pdfPath":"/iel5/5377996/5393306/05393716.pdf","publicationTitle":"2009 World Congress on Nature & Biologically Inspired Computing (NaBIC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 World Congress on Nature & Biologically Inspired Computing (NaBIC)","startPage":"1388","endPage":"1393","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5393306","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NABIC.2009.5393716","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Face recognition using probabilistic neural networks","abstract":"In this paper we address the problem of face detection and recognition of grey scale frontal view images.

Face verification is achieved using matching scores computed by correlating edge gradients of reference images. The advantage of classification using PNN models is its short training time. The correlation based template matching guarantees good classification results.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-11 Dec. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5393716/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11088934","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5393716/","publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"22 January 2010","conferenceDate":"9-11 Dec. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Face recognition using probabilistic neural networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Face recognition using probabilistic neural networks","confLoc":"Coimbatore, India","sourcePdf":"rp238INC009.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.128857S","chronDate":"9-11 Dec. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5377996","isNumber":"5393306","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5377996","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5393306","articleId":"5393716","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":5393722,"authors":[{"name":"Kusum Deep","affiliation":["Department of Mathematics, Indian Institute of Technology Roorkee, Roorkee, India"],"firstName":"Kusum","lastName":"Deep","id":"37598145400"},{"name":"Jagdish Chand Bansal","affiliation":["Department of Mathematics, Birla Institute of Technology and Science, Pilani, India"],"firstName":"Jagdish Chand","lastName":"Bansal","id":"37604735600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5053-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5393722","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":422},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5393722","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Relays","Particle swarm optimization","Power system relaying","Power system interconnection","Power system faults","Power system modeling","Optimization methods","Genetic algorithms","Mathematics","Constraint optimization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["overcurrent protection","particle swarm optimisation","power system relaying"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["laplace crossover particle swarm optimization","electrical engineering","optimal directional overcurrent relay times","constrained nonlinear continuous optimization problem","IEEE-3 bus system","IEEE-4 bus system","Laplace crossover particle swarm optimization","Laplace distribution"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Particle Swarm Optimization","LXPSO","Crossover Operator","Directional Overcurrent Relay Times"]}],"doi":"10.1109/NABIC.2009.5393722","pdfPath":"/iel5/5377996/5393306/05393722.pdf","publicationTitle":"2009 World Congress on Nature & Biologically Inspired Computing (NaBIC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 World Congress on Nature & Biologically Inspired Computing (NaBIC)","startPage":"288","endPage":"293","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5393306","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NABIC.2009.5393722","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimization of directional overcurrent relay times using Laplace Crossover Particle Swarm Optimization (LXPSO)","abstract":"An important problem in electrical engineering is to determine the optimal directional overcurrent relay times.

Two models are considered namely IEEE-3 bus system and IEEE-4 bus system. The optimization methodology is the Laplace Crossover Particle Swarm Optimization (LXPSO), which has recently been introduced by the authors. LXPSO uses a new information sharing strategy amongst the particles of the swarm using a new crossover, called Laplace Crossover (LX), based on Laplace distribution. The results obtained by LXPSO are compared with the results available in the literature. It is shown that LXPSO is able to provide superior results in terms of optimality and reliability in comparison to other methods.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-11 Dec. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5393722/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11088855","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5393722/","publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"22 January 2010","conferenceDate":"9-11 Dec. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Optimization of directional overcurrent relay times using Laplace Crossover Particle Swarm Optimization (LXPSO)","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimization of directional overcurrent relay times using Laplace Crossover Particle Swarm Optimization (LXPSO)","confLoc":"Coimbatore, India","sourcePdf":"rp049SE024.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.081746S","chronDate":"9-11 Dec. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5377996","isNumber":"5393306","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5377996","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"5393306","articleId":"5393722","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-29"},{"_id":5393723,"authors":[{"name":"Radha Thangaraj","affiliation":["Indian Institute of Technology Roorkee, India"],"lastName":"Radha Thangaraj","id":"37602969200"},{"name":"Millie Pant","affiliation":["Indian Institute of Technology Roorkee, India"],"lastName":"Millie Pant","id":"37603464400"},{"name":"Ajith Abraham","affiliation":["Norwegian University of Science and Technology, Norway"],"lastName":"Ajith Abraham","id":"37297713700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5053-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5393723","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":13,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":257},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A new diversity guided particle swarm optimization with mutation","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 World Congress on Nature & Biologically Inspired Computing (NaBIC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5377996/5393306/05393723.pdf","startPage":"294","endPage":"299","publicationTitle":"2009 World Congress on Nature & Biologically Inspired Computing (NaBIC)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NABIC.2009.5393723","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5393306","doi":"10.1109/NABIC.2009.5393723","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Particle swarm optimization","Genetic mutations","Diversity reception","Genetic programming","Convergence","Benchmark testing","Evolutionary computation","Genetic algorithms","Chaos","Birds"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["convergence","evolutionary computation","mathematical operators","particle swarm optimisation","statistical distributions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["diversity guided particle swarm optimization","optimization problem","evolutionary programming","mutation operator","swarm population","premature convergence","beta distribution"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Particle Swarm Optimization","Diversity","Mutation","global optimization"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5393723","abstract":"This paper presents a new diversity guided particle swarm optimization algorithm (PSO) named beta mutation PSO or BMPSO for solving global optimization problems.

Beta distribution is used to perform the mutation in the proposed BMPSO algorithm.

However, selecting peers in BitTorrent for efficient content distribution still poses a number of challenges due to high heterogeneities of peers with varied rates of uploading bandwidth and dynamic content. This paper presents GA-BT, a genetic algorithm based peer selection optimization strategy for efficient content distribution in BitTorrent networks taking into account both the uploading bandwidth of peers and the availability of content among peers. GA-BT employs the divisible load theory to dynamically predict optimal fitness values to speed up the convergence process in producing optimal or near optimal solutions in peer selection. A BitTorrent simulator is implemented for GA-BT performance evaluation, and the experimental results show the effectiveness of GA-BT in peer selection optimization.","doi":"10.1109/NABIC.2009.5393747","startPage":"336","endPage":"341","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 World Congress on Nature & Biologically Inspired Computing (NaBIC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5377996/5393306/05393747.pdf","publicationTitle":"2009 World Congress on Nature & Biologically Inspired Computing (NaBIC)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NABIC.2009.5393747","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5393306","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A genetic algorithm based peer selection strategy for BitTorrent networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Genetic algorithms","Bandwidth","Delay","IP networks","Peer to peer computing","Optimal scheduling","Genetic engineering","Design engineering","Algorithm design and analysis","Availability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithms","Internet","peer-to-peer computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithm","peer selection optimization","BitTorrent network","peer-to-peer network","digital content distribution","Internet","divisible load theory"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["P2P networks","BitTorrent","peer selection","divisible load theory","genetic algorithms"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5393747/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-11 Dec. 2009","displayDocTitle":"A genetic algorithm based peer selection strategy for BitTorrent networks","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5393747/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"22 January 2010","conferenceDate":"9-11 Dec. 2009","accessionNumber":"11088871","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A genetic algorithm based peer selection strategy for BitTorrent networks","confLoc":"Coimbatore, India","sourcePdf":"rp057NABIC126.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056161S","chronDate":"9-11 Dec. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5377996","isNumber":"5393306","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5377996","xplore-issue":"5393306","articleId":"5393747","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":5393750,"authors":[{"name":"K.R.

It requires a direct inversion of the degradation function in frequency domain which is ill posed in nature. So regularization has been used in the restoration process. The selection of regularization parameter still remains a difficult problem due to the amplification of noise in the inversion process.

This paper presents a modified, low complexity K-best detector for a 4\u00d74, 64 QAM MIMO system , which uses a modified path extension algorithm to bring down the computational complexity by more than 50%. It also exploits the structure of a QAM constellation to achieve low power operation by reducing the number of costly multiplication operations while computing the path metrics. The two new approaches, combined with a resource shared architecture leads to the implementation of a very efficient FPGA based system, where we verify the performance of the algorithm.","doi":"10.1109/ICM.2008.5393766","publicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Microelectronics","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Microelectronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/5374439/5393492/05393766.pdf","startPage":"337","endPage":"340","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5393492","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICM.2008.5393766","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the VLSI Implementation of low complexity K-best MIMO decoders","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5393766/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-17 Dec. 2008","displayDocTitle":"On the VLSI Implementation of low complexity K-best MIMO decoders","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5393766/","dateOfInsertion":"22 January 2010","publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","accessionNumber":"11087903","conferenceDate":"14-17 Dec. 2008","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the VLSI Implementation of low complexity K-best MIMO decoders","confLoc":"Sharjah, United Arab Emirates","sourcePdf":"1569134935.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043186S","chronDate":"14-17 Dec. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"5374439","isNumber":"5393492","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5374439","xplore-issue":"5393492","articleId":"5393766","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5393778,"authors":[{"name":"Petr Klement","affiliation":["MEDIUMSOFT a.s., Ostrava, Czech Republic"],"firstName":"Petr","lastName":"Klement","id":"37680529900"},{"name":"V\u00e1clav Sn\u00e1\u0161el","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, V\u0160B - Technical University of Ostrava, Ostrava, Czech Republic"],"firstName":"V\u00e1clav","lastName":"Sn\u00e1\u0161el","id":"37586966900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5053-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5393778","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":95},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5393778","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Intelligent networks","Disaster management","Spatial databases","Management information systems","Data visualization","Visual databases","Organizing","Safety","Information systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data mining","database management systems","emergency services","information systems","knowledge representation","self-organising feature maps"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["disaster management","emergency call taking information system","data mining","automatic management module","knowledge discovery","knowledge visualization","Kohonen self organizing map algorithm","SOM neural network","system traffic reconfiguration","temporal anomalies","Czech Republic","spatial anomalies"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Emergency Call","Self Organizing Map","Knowledge Discovery in Databases","Data Clustering"]}],"doi":"10.1109/NABIC.2009.5393778","pdfPath":"/iel5/5377996/5393306/05393778.pdf","publicationTitle":"2009 World Congress on Nature & Biologically Inspired Computing (NaBIC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 World Congress on Nature & Biologically Inspired Computing (NaBIC)","startPage":"872","endPage":"877","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5393306","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NABIC.2009.5393778","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"SOM neural network - a piece of intelligence in disaster management","abstract":"A collaborative emergency call taking information system in the Czech Republic processes calls from the European 112 emergency number.

A comparison of simulation results indicates that the proposed algorithm can produce better solution than other optimization techniques.","doi":"10.1109/NABIC.2009.5393791","pdfPath":"/iel5/5377996/5393306/05393791.pdf","startPage":"1219","endPage":"1224","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 World Congress on Nature & Biologically Inspired Computing (NaBIC)","publicationTitle":"2009 World Congress on Nature & Biologically Inspired Computing (NaBIC)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NABIC.2009.5393791","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5393306","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Turbulent Crazy Particle swarm Optimization technique for optimal reactive power dispatch","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5393791/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-11 Dec. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Turbulent Crazy Particle swarm Optimization technique for optimal reactive power dispatch","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"22 January 2010","accessionNumber":"11134419","publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5393791/","conferenceDate":"9-11 Dec. 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Turbulent Crazy Particle swarm Optimization technique for optimal reactive power dispatch","confLoc":"Coimbatore, India","sourcePdf":"rp208BICA059.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.074639S","chronDate":"9-11 Dec. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5377996","isNumber":"5393306","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5377996","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"5393306","articleId":"5393791","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5393795,"authors":[{"name":"T.

A SAR with multiple receiving apertures aligned in flight direction repeatedly images the same ground area with a short time lag. This allows for an effective detection of moving ground objects, whose range variation translates into an interferometric phase signal between the receiving channels. The high-resolution German SAR satellite TerraSAR-X offers several ways to create multiple along-track apertures. We exploit this to demonstrate satellite-based traffic-flow measurements using along-track interferometry (ATI) and Displaced Phase Center Array techniques. In this paper, we address the usage of different TerraSAR-X ATI modes for data acquisition and describe an automatic near-real-time processing chain for the extraction of traffic information. The performance of this TerraSAR-X traffic processor is significantly driven by incorporating \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">a priori</i>\n knowledge of road networks.

Given a pair of origin and destination, there are many possible routes. Most current car navigation systems propose the shortest path from the origin to the destination. Selecting the shortest path is not a hard problem, but the shortest path is not always what the user wants; what the user really wants to have is the most comfortable route for him or her to drive. In other words, the driver wants to have a car navigation system to propose the subjectively optimal route for him or her. Finding such a route requires enumerating all the possible routes, and is known as a NP-complete problem. In order to reduce computational complexity, we employed a GA to find a (subjectively) quasi-optimal route for the driver. In the previous paper, we reported our attempt to integrate uncomfortable-turns to our GA-based route selection algorithm. Even though GA provided a quasi-optimal route in most cases and certainly much faster than exhaustive search, we have found that the classical Dijkstra algorithm can be used to find subjectively the most comfortable route by changing the data structure. In this paper, we show how the data structure that represents routes can be modified to assist Dijkstra's algorithm to find subjectively optimal driving route. The numerical experiments demonstrate the feasibility of our route selection based on Dijkstra algorithm with extended data structure.","doi":"10.1109/ICCCYB.2009.5393932","pdfPath":"/iel5/5375731/5393922/05393932.pdf","startPage":"45","endPage":"50","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Computational Cybernetics (ICCC)","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Computational Cybernetics (ICCC)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCCYB.2009.5393932","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5393922","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dijkstra beats genetic algorithm: Integrating uncomfortable intersection-turns to subjectively optimal route selection","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Geoscience"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5393932/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 Jan. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Dijkstra beats genetic algorithm: Integrating uncomfortable intersection-turns to subjectively optimal route selection","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"22 January 2010","accessionNumber":"11135113","publicationDate":"Nov. 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5393932/","conferenceDate":"26-29 Jan. 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dijkstra beats genetic algorithm: Integrating uncomfortable intersection-turns to subjectively optimal route selection","confLoc":"Palma de Mallorca, Spain","sourcePdf":"4iccc2009.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.085331S","chronDate":"26-29 Jan. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5375731","isNumber":"5393922","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5375731","xplore-issue":"5393922","articleId":"5393932","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":5393942,"authors":[{"name":"Imre J.

This in turn translates into potentially better data rates (throughput) for macrocell users and may offer the possibility of adding more users to the macro network while preserving the network configuration -- resulting in direct capital expenditure savings. The approach taken in this article consists of creating a framework for quantifying macro offloading benefits in joint macro-femto deployments. A baseline configuration where all users (indoor and outdoor) are served by a traditional macro network (state-of-the-art macro only network) is considered first. The analysis is followed through joint macro-femto deployments, where femtocells serve indoor users. Through comparison of the baseline configuration and the joint macro-femto analysis, we quantify the benefits of the joint macro-femto deployment.","doi":"10.1109/MCOM.2010.5394026","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Magazine","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel5/35/5394016/05394026.pdf","startPage":"26","endPage":"32","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MCOM.2010.5394026","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5394016","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On femto deployment architectures and macrocell offloading benefits in joint macro-femto deployments","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5394026/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 January 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"January  2010","displayDocTitle":"On femto deployment architectures and macrocell offloading benefits in joint macro-femto deployments","volume":"48","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"January 2010","accessionNumber":"11087681","htmlLink":"/document/5394026/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"22 January 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On femto deployment architectures and macrocell offloading benefits in joint macro-femto deployments","sourcePdf":"010CALINLAYOUT.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.070224S","chronDate":"January  2010","xplore-pub-id":"35","isNumber":"5394016","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"35","citationCount":"136","xplore-issue":"5394016","articleId":"5394026","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5394027,"authors":[{"name":"Guillaume de la Roche","affiliation":["University of Bedfordshire, UK"],"bio":{"p":["Guillaume de la Roche (guillaume.delaroche@beds.ac.uk) has been working as a research fellow at the Centre for Wireless Network Design (CWiND), United Kingdom, since 2007.

However, the avoidance of interference is still an issue that needs to be addressed to successfully deploy a femtocell tier over existing macrocell networks. Moreover, interference is strongly dependent on the type of access control, which decides if a given user can or cannot connect to the femtocell. In this article the existing access methods for femtocells together with their benefits and drawbacks are explained. A description of the business model and technical impact of access methods in femto/macro networks is also provided.

Mobile devices are designed with several hard constraints such as low cost and small geometries, as well as, low heat dissipation, and operation using fixed power sources. Manufacturers have been adding an ever increasing set of features to small mobile devices, which are no longer binary-use gadgets, but fully-fledged computers. With respect to power management, several mechanisms have been introduced; but, by and large, gains in power consumption at the hardware level have been essentially traded for extended functionality. All in all, the overall operational time has not increased. For example, early GSM cellular phones could only allow for less than an hour of talk time in a single battery charge. By the late 1990s, top models, introduced through better engineering and an evolutionary development approach, featured talk times increased by a factor of 3-5. This level of performance has remained the same over the last decade, although it is well below user expectations. This article reviews the evolution from simple cell phones toward the feature-rich mobile networked devices we have come to expect from manufacturers, and explains the factors that have led to stagnation in operational time. We then turn our attention to the multiaccess nature of modern mobile devices and the respective implications for power management. We find that the current host-centric mobile networking paradigm, based on end-to-end always on connectivity, leads to energy-inefficient operation. Finally, this article introduces information-centric networking and outlines open research issues in the design of energy-efficient future Internet architectures.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 January 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"January  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5394036/","volume":"48","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/5394036/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11074205","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"January 2010","dateOfInsertion":"22 January 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"In search of energy-efficient mobile networking","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"In search of energy-efficient mobile networking","sourcePdf":"020PENTIKOUSISLAYOUT.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.072167S","chronDate":"January  2010","xplore-pub-id":"35","isNumber":"5394016","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"35","citationCount":"98","xplore-issue":"5394016","articleId":"5394036","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5394115,"authors":[{"name":"Sam Chung","affiliation":["Institute of Technology, University of Washington, Tacoma, Tacoma, WA, USA"],"firstName":"Sam","lastName":"Chung","id":"37404238300"},{"name":"Sergio Davalos","affiliation":["Milgard School of Business, University of Washington, Tacoma, Tacoma, WA, USA"],"firstName":"Sergio","lastName":"Davalos","id":"37563982500"},{"name":"Craig Niiyama","affiliation":["Institute of Technology, University of Washington, Tacoma, Tacoma, WA, USA"],"firstName":"Craig","lastName":"Niiyama","id":"38109415400"},{"name":"Daehee Won","affiliation":["Division of Applied Robot Technology, Korea Institute of Industrial and Technology, Ansan, Gyeonggi, South Korea"],"firstName":"Daehee","lastName":"Won","id":"37287734200"},{"name":"Seung-Ho Baeg","affiliation":["Division of Applied Robot Technology, Korea Institute of Industrial and Technology, Ansan, Gyeonggi, South Korea"],"firstName":"Seung-Ho","lastName":"Baeg","id":"37294620600"},{"name":"Sangdeok Park","affiliation":["Division of Applied Robot Technology, Korea Institute of Industrial and Technology, Ansan, Gyeonggi, South Korea"],"firstName":"Sangdeok","lastName":"Park","id":"37293214500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5338-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-5336-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5394115","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":391},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Unified modeling language","Virtual enterprises","Semiconductor optical amplifiers","Service oriented architecture","Business process re-engineering","Reverse engineering","Guidelines","Virtual groups","Web services","Engines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["business process re-engineering","reverse engineering","software architecture","Unified Modeling Language","virtual enterprises","Web services"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["UML model-driven business process development","ESB","SOA","virtual enterprise integration project","service-oriented architecture","enterprise service bus","service brokers virtual team","Web services","business process engines","WSDL","WS-BPEL","legacy VE","reverse engineering","loan application process system","forward engineering","Washington State Patrol","drug recognition evaluation system"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Virtual Enterprise Integration","Business Process Development Methodology","Enterprise Service Bus"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5394115","doi":"10.1109/APSCC.2009.5394115","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APSCC.2009.5394115","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5394078","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Asia-Pacific Services Computing Conference (APSCC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Asia-Pacific Services Computing Conference (APSCC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5374429/5394078/05394115.pdf","startPage":"246","endPage":"253","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A UML model-driven business process development methodology for a Virtual Enterprise using SOA & ESB","abstract":"The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate how a Virtual Enterprise Integration (VEI) project using Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) and Enterprise Service Bus (ESB) can be effectively conducted by a virtual team of service brokers. Currently, VEI is accomplished through SOA and ESB using web services and business process engines that execute WSDL and WS-BPEL. To reengineer a Virtual Enterprise (VE) based on one or more legacy components, referred to as a legacy VE, the abstract and concrete parts of the relevant business processes of the VE need to be reverse engineered to a high level of abstraction. To develop new business processes, business process requirements need to be forward engineered into business processes in BPEL. However, service brokers need guidelines for comprehending the operations of the legacy VEs or for understanding the business process requirement. In order to provide clear communication of this information, we propose a UML model driven Business Process Development Methodology (BPDM) called mBPDM. We demonstrate its applicability and capabilities by applying it to two case studies: a loan application process system which involves reverse engineering and Washington State Patrol's Drug Recognition Evaluation system which involves forward engineering. Based upon the results of reverse and forward engineering of two virtual enterprise cases, the guidelines, which use UML as a blueprint with multi-architectural views, help service brokers understand the underlying process architecture and organization of a virtual enterprise that has been built using the SOA concept and the contemporary ESB.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5394115/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-11 Dec. 2009","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"7-11 Dec. 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5394115/","dateOfInsertion":"22 January 2010","publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","accessionNumber":"11133994","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A UML model-driven business process development methodology for a Virtual Enterprise using SOA & ESB","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A UML model-driven business process development methodology for a Virtual Enterprise using SOA & ESB","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"rp035184.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060569S","chronDate":"7-11 Dec. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5374429","isNumber":"5394078","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5374429","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5394078","articleId":"5394115","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5394127,"authors":[{"name":"Dusit Niyato","affiliation":["School of Computer Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"firstName":"Dusit","lastName":"Niyato","id":"37296968900"},{"name":"Sivadon Chaisiri","affiliation":["School of Computer Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"firstName":"Sivadon","lastName":"Chaisiri","id":"37303893500"},{"name":"Bu-Sung Lee","affiliation":["School of Computer Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"firstName":"Bu-Sung","lastName":"Lee","id":"37281110400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5338-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-5336-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5394127","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":11,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":567},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Economic analysis of resource market in cloud computing environment","abstract":"Cloud computing has been emerged as the flexible, efficient, and economical distributed computing platform to meet the dynamic and random demand from the users.

Cloud providers can offer users two payment plans, i.e., reservation and on-demand plans for resource provisioning. Price of resources in reservation plan is generally cheaper than that in on-demand plan. However, since the reservation plan has to be acquired in advance, it may not fully meet future demands in which the on-demand plan can be used to guarantee the availability to the user. In this paper, we propose an optimal virtual machine placement (OVMP) algorithm. This algorithm can minimize the cost spending in each plan for hosting virtual machines in a multiple cloud provider environment under future demand and price uncertainty. OVMP algorithm makes a decision based on the optimal solution of stochastic integer programming (SIP) to rent resources from cloud providers. The performance of OVMP algorithm is evaluated by numerical studies and simulation. The results clearly show that the proposed OVMP algorithm can minimize users' budgets. This algorithm can be applied to provision resources in emerging cloud computing environments.","doi":"10.1109/APSCC.2009.5394134","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Asia-Pacific Services Computing Conference (APSCC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Asia-Pacific Services Computing Conference (APSCC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5374429/5394078/05394134.pdf","startPage":"103","endPage":"110","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APSCC.2009.5394134","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5394078","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal virtual machine placement across multiple cloud providers","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5394134","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-11 Dec. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5394134/","displayDocTitle":"Optimal virtual machine placement across multiple cloud providers","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","accessionNumber":"11134001","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5394134/","conferenceDate":"7-11 Dec. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"22 January 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal virtual machine placement across multiple cloud providers","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"rp018040.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.076624S","chronDate":"7-11 Dec. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5374429","isNumber":"5394078","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5374429","citationCount":"183","xplore-issue":"5394078","articleId":"5394134","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":5394164,"authors":[{"name":"Jinshan Yu","affiliation":["School of Computer Science, National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, China"],"lastName":"Jinshan Yu","id":"37291384300"},{"name":"Ruitao Zhang","affiliation":["National Laboratory of Analog IC' s, Chongqing, China"],"lastName":"Ruitao Zhang","id":"37533622800"},{"name":"YuJing Li","affiliation":["National Laboratory of Analog IC' s, Chongqing, China"],"lastName":"YuJing Li","id":"38025348100"},{"name":"Dongbing Fu","lastName":"Dongbing Fu","id":"37066092800"},{"name":"RuZhang Li","lastName":"RuZhang Li","id":"37538672800"},{"name":"Yafeng Yao","lastName":"Yafeng Yao","id":"38104211100"},{"name":"Tun Li","lastName":"Tun Li","id":"37280720400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4297-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4298-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5394164","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":263},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Digital circuit design for a high-speed direct digital frequency synthesizer","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Digital circuits","Frequency synthesizers","Amplitude modulation","CMOS technology","Laboratories","Phase modulation","Digital modulation","Clocks","Electronic equipment testing","Computer architecture"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS integrated circuits","digital integrated circuits","frequency synthesizers","integrated circuit design"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["digital circuit design","high-speed direct digital frequency synthesizer","phase accumulator","phase offset producer","sine/cosine mapping function","clock generator","DDFS","TSMC CMOS technology","amplitude modulation","size 0.18 mum"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["CMOS","DDFS","CORDIC","DataPath"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5394164","abstract":"In this paper, a high-speed direct digital frequency synthesizer digital circuit design is presented, which integrates phase accumulator, phase offset producer, sine/cosine mapping function, amplitude modulator, clock generator.

The simulation results demonstrate ideal characteristics in both cell operations and power consumption. The write operation of the cell is within 1ns attributed to the impact ionization effect. Low power consumption is achieved by using GIDL because the coupling between the front and back gates restrains the impact ionization current.

The SO saves about 30%~40% of the total power since its output stage is just turned off at the integrating phase. To further increase efficiency a novel high power efficiency class AB current mirror SO is proposed in this paper. By turning off the entire SO together with its common mode feedback (CMFB) circuit, the power consumption of the SO can be reduced by 50%. A Class-AB load-compensated opamp version improves the power efficiency further. The proposed SO was fabricated in a 0.35 \u00bfm TSMC CMOS standard process and achieved a DC gain of 62.7 dB, a GBW of 4.39 MHz and a slew rate of 1.2 V/\u00bfs when the load capacitor is 10 pF. The effective power consumption including the CMFB circuit is 6.6 \u00bfW under 1.5 V supply voltage. The simulation results showed that the proposed SO can be applied to low power low voltage SDM with a frequency of less than 0.5 MHz.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5394224/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-27 Dec. 2009","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"25-27 Dec. 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5394224/","dateOfInsertion":"22 January 2010","publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","accessionNumber":"11089348","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A high power efficiency Class AB switched-opamp for low voltage low power sigma-delta modulators","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A high power efficiency Class AB switched-opamp for low voltage low power sigma-delta modulators","confLoc":"Xi'an","sourcePdf":"182.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050518S","chronDate":"25-27 Dec. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5374436","isNumber":"5394151","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5374436","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5394151","articleId":"5394224","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":5394270,"authors":[{"name":"Wang Xu","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Network Oriented Intelligent Computation, Shenzhen Graduate School, Harbin Institute of Technology, Shenzhen, China"],"lastName":"Wang Xu","id":"37087649251"},{"name":"Zhang Yan","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Network Oriented Intelligent Computation, Shenzhen Graduate School, Harbin Institute of Technology, Shenzhen, China"],"lastName":"Zhang Yan","id":"37087648109"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4297-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4298-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5394270","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":74},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Very large scale integration","Elliptic curves","Computer architecture","Elliptic curve cryptography","Concurrent computing","Equations","Laboratories","Computer networks","Electronic mail","Galois fields"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cryptography","digital arithmetic","field programmable gate arrays","multiplying circuits","pipeline arithmetic","VLSI"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["pseudo pipelined VLSI architecture","elliptic curve scalar multiplications","elliptic curve encryption algorithms","word serial finite field multipliers","FPGA"]}],"abstract":"Two elliptic curve scalar multiplications (ECMLT) are used in some important elliptic curve encryption algorithms, a pseudo-pipelined VLSI architecture of two ECMLTs over GF(2\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">m</sup>\n) is proposed for these algorithms.

Quadrature Doppler ultrasound signals are dual channel signals obtained from the systems employing quadrature demodulation. Prior to processing Doppler signals by using discrete Wavelet transform, directional flow signals must be obtained and then two separate transform applied, increasing the computational complexity. In order to decrease computational complexity, a complex discrete wavelet transform algorithm is proposed. A comparison between the new transform and the conventional technique is presented. The results show that the proposed method gives the same output as the conventional technique and the computational complexity for processing quadrature signals using discrete complex wavelet transform is greatly reduced.","doi":"10.1109/ITAB.2009.5394302","publicationTitle":"2009 9th International Conference on Information Technology and Applications in Biomedicine","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 9th International Conference on Information Technology and Applications in Biomedicine","pdfPath":"/iel5/5353034/5394290/05394302.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ITAB.2009.5394302","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5394290","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A complex discrete wavelet transform for processing quadrature Doppler ultrasound signals","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5394302","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-7 Nov. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5394302/","displayDocTitle":"A complex discrete wavelet transform for processing quadrature Doppler ultrasound signals","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2009","accessionNumber":"11088372","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5394302/","conferenceDate":"4-7 Nov. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"22 January 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A complex discrete wavelet transform for processing quadrature Doppler ultrasound signals","confLoc":"Larnaka, Cyprus","sourcePdf":"Th331.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060452S","chronDate":"4-7 Nov. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5353034","isNumber":"5394290","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5353034","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"5394290","articleId":"5394302","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5394313,"authors":[{"name":"E.

For any arbitrary fixed number of messages, a single-letter characterization of the minimum sum-rate function was provided in previous work using traditional information-theoretic techniques. This, however, does not directly lead to a satisfactory characterization of the infinite-message limit, which is a new, unexplored dimension for asymptotic-analysis in distributed block source coding involving potentially infinitesimal-rate messages. This paper introduces a new convex-geometric approach to provide a blocklength-free single-letter characterization of the infinite-message minimum sum-rate function as a functional of the joint source pmf. This characterization is not obtained by taking a limit as the number of messages goes to infinity. Instead, it is in terms of the least element of a family of partially-ordered marginal-perturbations-concave functionals associated with the functions to be computed. For computing the Boolean AND function of two independent Bernoulli sources at one and both terminals, the respective infinite-message minimum sum-rates are characterized in closed analytic form. These sum-rates are achievable using infinitely many infinitesimal-rate messages. The convex-geometric functional viewpoint also suggests an iterative algorithm for evaluating any finite-message minimum sum-rate function.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5394483","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ALLERTON.2009.5394497","publicationTitle":"2009 47th Annual Allerton Conference on Communication, Control, and Computing (Allerton)","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 47th Annual Allerton Conference on Communication, Control, and Computing (Allerton)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5375733/5394483/05394497.pdf","startPage":"1510","endPage":"1517","doi":"10.1109/ALLERTON.2009.5394497","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Infinite-message distributed source coding for two-terminal interactive computing","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 30 2009-Oct. 2 2009","displayDocTitle":"Infinite-message distributed source coding for two-terminal interactive computing","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"30 Sept.-2 Oct. 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5394497/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"11135211","dateOfInsertion":"22 January 2010","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5394497/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Infinite-message distributed source coding for two-terminal interactive computing","confLoc":"Monticello, IL, USA","sourcePdf":"2070394.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.081803S","chronDate":"Sept. 30 2009-Oct. 2 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5375733","isNumber":"5394483","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5375733","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"5394483","articleId":"5394497","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":5394498,"authors":[{"name":"Tariq R.

As a key illustrative example, we consider a 4 \u00d7 4 system employing a unitary matrix waveform set, e.g., formed from Golay complementary sequences. When a non-negligible Doppler shift is induced by the target motion, the waveform matrix formed from the complementary sequences is no longer unitary, resulting in significantly degraded target range estimates. To solve this problem, we adopt a subspace based approach exploiting the observation that the receive matrix formed from matched filtering of the reflected waveforms has a (non-trivial) null-space. Through processing of the waveforms with the appropriate vector from the null-space, we can significantly improve the detection performance. We provide simulation results to confirm the theoretical analysis.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Target detection in MIMO radar using Golay complementary sequences in the presence of Doppler","publicationTitle":"2009 47th Annual Allerton Conference on Communication, Control, and Computing (Allerton)","doi":"10.1109/ALLERTON.2009.5394498","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 47th Annual Allerton Conference on Communication, Control, and Computing (Allerton)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5375733/5394483/05394498.pdf","startPage":"1490","endPage":"1493","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ALLERTON.2009.5394498","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5394483","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5394498","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5394498/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 30 2009-Oct. 2 2009","displayDocTitle":"Target detection in MIMO radar using Golay complementary sequences in the presence of Doppler","conferenceDate":"30 Sept.-2 Oct. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5394498/","dateOfInsertion":"22 January 2010","publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"11135212","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Target detection in MIMO radar using Golay complementary sequences in the presence of Doppler","confLoc":"Monticello, IL, USA","sourcePdf":"2040279.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055367S","chronDate":"Sept. 30 2009-Oct. 2 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5375733","isNumber":"5394483","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5375733","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5394483","articleId":"5394498","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5394511,"authors":[{"name":"Chiranjib Choudhuri","affiliation":["Ming Hsieh Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Chiranjib","lastName":"Choudhuri","id":"37847187200"},{"name":"Urbashi Mitra","affiliation":["Ming Hsieh Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Urbashi","lastName":"Mitra","id":"37269542000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5871-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5870-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5394511","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":127},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Relays","Transmitters","Channel capacity","Clocks","Synchronization","MIMO","Upper bound","Uncertainty","Parity check codes","Decoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ad hoc networks","channel capacity","MIMO communication","parity check codes","synchronisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["symbol-asynchronous single-relay channel capacity","sensor networks","MIMO relay channel","memory","symbol epochs","bilayer LDPC codes","MLC coding","MSD decoding"]}],"abstract":"The capacity of the symbol-asynchronous single-relay channel is investigated. Symbol asynchronism implies that the codewords transmitted from the relay and the source do not coincide in time at the destination. Due to propagation or implementation effects (e.g. mis-synchronized clocks), symbol asynchronism occurs in many practical situations. In ad hoc scenarios, such as sensor networks, achieving perfect synchronism is challenging (due to the distributed nature of the network). Herein it is shown that the symbol-asynchronous single-relay channel can be modeled as a MIMO relay channel with memory. First, lower and upper bounds on the capacity are derived under the assumption that the receivers know the symbol epochs and the transmitters know their mutual offset. Next, the case where the transmitters only know that the mutual offsets that parameterize the channel belong to an uncertainty set and receivers have no knowledge of the symbol epochs is examined. Conditions for characterizing capacity (when the upper and lower bounds match) are also derived. Simple asynchronous coding schemes for the relay channel are also explored. The proposed coding scheme can be extended to the relay with memory. Bilayer LDPC codes are used to replicate the binning strategy of the relay and MLC coding with MSD decoding is used to counter the effect of memory.","publicationTitle":"2009 47th Annual Allerton Conference on Communication, Control, and Computing (Allerton)","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 47th Annual Allerton Conference on Communication, Control, and Computing (Allerton)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5375733/5394483/05394511.pdf","startPage":"1411","endPage":"1418","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the capacity of the symbol-asynchronous relay channel","doi":"10.1109/ALLERTON.2009.5394511","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5394483","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ALLERTON.2009.5394511","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5394511","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5394511/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 30 2009-Oct. 2 2009","displayDocTitle":"On the capacity of the symbol-asynchronous relay channel","dateOfInsertion":"22 January 2010","publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"11089546","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"30 Sept.-2 Oct. 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5394511/","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the capacity of the symbol-asynchronous relay channel","confLoc":"Monticello, IL, USA","sourcePdf":"1930300.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057907S","chronDate":"Sept. 30 2009-Oct. 2 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5375733","isNumber":"5394483","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5375733","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"5394483","articleId":"5394511","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5394517,"authors":[{"name":"Sahand Haji Ali Ahmad","affiliation":["The Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA"],"firstName":"Sahand Haji Ali","lastName":"Ahmad","id":"37570028700"},{"name":"Mingyan Liu","affiliation":["The Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA"],"firstName":"Mingyan","lastName":"Liu","id":"37275671500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5871-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5870-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5394517","dbTime":"15 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":67,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":303},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Markov processes","Infinite horizon","Stochastic systems","Control systems","Stochastic processes","Probability distribution","Computer science","Application software","Fading","Interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Markov processes","stochastic systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multichannel opportunistic access","stochastic control problem","distributed Markov processes","channel state transitions","multiple plays","restless bandit problem"]}],"abstract":"This paper considers the following stochastic control problem that arises in opportunistic spectrum access: a system consists of n channels where the state (\u00bfgood\u00bf or \u00bfbad\u00bf) of each channel evolves as independent and identically distributed Markov processes. A user can select exactly k channels to sense and access (based on the sensing result) in each time slot. A reward is obtained whenever the user senses and accesses a \u00bfgood\u00bf channel. The objective is to design a channel selection policy that maximizes the expected discounted total reward accrued over a finite or infinite horizon. In our previous work we established the optimality of a greedy policy for the special case of k=1 (i.e., single channel access) under the condition that the channel state transitions are positively correlated over time. In this paper we show under the same condition the greedy policy is optimal for the general case of k\u00bf1; the methodology introduced here is thus more general. This problem may be viewed as a special case of the restless bandit problem, with multiple plays. We discuss connections between the current problem and existing literature on this class of problems.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multi-channel opportunistic access: A case of restless bandits with multiple plays","publicationTitle":"2009 47th Annual Allerton Conference on Communication, Control, and Computing (Allerton)","doi":"10.1109/ALLERTON.2009.5394517","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 47th Annual Allerton Conference on Communication, Control, and Computing (Allerton)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5375733/5394483/05394517.pdf","startPage":"1361","endPage":"1368","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ALLERTON.2009.5394517","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5394483","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5394517","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5394517/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 30 2009-Oct. 2 2009","displayDocTitle":"Multi-channel opportunistic access: A case of restless bandits with multiple plays","conferenceDate":"30 Sept.-2 Oct. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5394517/","dateOfInsertion":"22 January 2010","publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"11089549","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multi-channel opportunistic access: A case of restless bandits with multiple plays","confLoc":"Monticello, IL, USA","sourcePdf":"1870308.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.115813S","chronDate":"Sept. 30 2009-Oct. 2 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5375733","isNumber":"5394483","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5375733","citationCount":"67","xplore-issue":"5394483","articleId":"5394517","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5394518,"authors":[{"name":"Yan Zhu","affiliation":["Northwestern University, IL, USA"],"firstName":"Yan","lastName":"Zhu","id":"37538647400"},{"name":"Dongning Guo","affiliation":["Northwestern University, IL, USA"],"firstName":"Dongning","lastName":"Guo","id":"37272631900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5871-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5870-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5394518","dbTime":"17 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":19,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":156},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Interference channels","Transmitters","Fading","Receiving antennas","Rayleigh channels","Channel state information","Propagation losses","Transmitting antennas","Noise level"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fading channels","interference (signal)","MIMO communication","radio receivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO interference channels","loss of degrees of freedom","isotropic fading","channel state information","receivers"]}],"abstract":"This paper studies two-user MIMO interference channel with isotropic fading.

In this paper, we address distributed rate optimization for Time-Division Duplex (TDD) Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) networks when part of the local channel knowledge is learned via message passing between each transmitter and its intended receivers. The distributed optimization algorithm is based on a rate duality and the corresponding input covariance matrix transformation between the forward and reverse links of TDD MIMO networks under the assumption of global channel knowledge. Noting that the key information required by the proposed transformation is the interference-plus-noise covariance matrix, we propose a local covariance matrix transformation such that each node can distributedly optimize its input covariance matrix by only exchanging interference-plus-noise covariance matrix locally. It is observed from the simulation that the proposed algorithm achieves a performance close to the one with global channel knowledge and outperforms the existing distributed algorithms.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Distributed MIMO network optimization based on duality and local message passing","publicationTitle":"2009 47th Annual Allerton Conference on Communication, Control, and Computing (Allerton)","doi":"10.1109/ALLERTON.2009.5394519","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 47th Annual Allerton Conference on Communication, Control, and Computing (Allerton)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5375733/5394483/05394519.pdf","startPage":"1345","endPage":"1352","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ALLERTON.2009.5394519","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5394483","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5394519","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5394519/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 30 2009-Oct. 2 2009","displayDocTitle":"Distributed MIMO network optimization based on duality and local message passing","conferenceDate":"30 Sept.-2 Oct. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5394519/","dateOfInsertion":"22 January 2010","publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"11089551","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distributed MIMO network optimization based on duality and local message passing","confLoc":"Monticello, IL, USA","sourcePdf":"1850190.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.121123S","chronDate":"Sept. 30 2009-Oct. 2 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5375733","isNumber":"5394483","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5375733","xplore-issue":"5394483","articleId":"5394519","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5394520,"authors":[{"name":"Chris T.

Without base station cooperation, the system is interference-limited. The interference limitation is overcome when the base stations are allowed to jointly encode the user signals, but the capacity-achieving dirty paper coding scheme can be too complex for practical implementation. A new linear precoding technique called soft interference nulling (SIN) is proposed, which performs at least as well as zero-forcing (ZF) beamforming under full network coordination. Unlike ZF, SIN allows the possibility of but over-penalizes interference. The SIN precoder is computed by solving a convex optimization problem, and the formulation is extended to multiple-antenna channels. SIN can be applied when only a limited number of base stations cooperate; it is shown that SIN under partial network coordination can outperform full network coordination ZF at moderate SNRs.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5394483","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ALLERTON.2009.5394520","publicationTitle":"2009 47th Annual Allerton Conference on Communication, Control, and Computing (Allerton)","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 47th Annual Allerton Conference on Communication, Control, and Computing (Allerton)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5375733/5394483/05394520.pdf","startPage":"1323","endPage":"1329","doi":"10.1109/ALLERTON.2009.5394520","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient linear precoding in downlink cooperative cellular networks with soft interference nulling","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 30 2009-Oct. 2 2009","displayDocTitle":"Efficient linear precoding in downlink cooperative cellular networks with soft interference nulling","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"30 Sept.-2 Oct. 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5394520/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"11089552","dateOfInsertion":"22 January 2010","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5394520/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient linear precoding in downlink cooperative cellular networks with soft interference nulling","confLoc":"Monticello, IL, USA","sourcePdf":"1820160.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062933S","chronDate":"Sept. 30 2009-Oct. 2 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5375733","isNumber":"5394483","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5375733","xplore-issue":"5394483","articleId":"5394520","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5394526,"authors":[{"name":"Ersen Ekrem","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Maryland, College Park, MD, USA"],"firstName":"Ersen","lastName":"Ekrem","id":"37395816700"},{"name":"Sennur Ulukus","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Maryland, College Park, MD, USA"],"firstName":"Sennur","lastName":"Ulukus","id":"37273214000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5871-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5870-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5394526","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":132},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Degradation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["broadcast channels","fading channels","Gaussian channels","MIMO communication","multicast communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["secrecy capacity region","degraded compound multi-receiver wiretap channel","general discrete memoryless channel model","Gaussian parallel channel model","MIMO channel model"]}],"abstract":"We study the degraded compound multi-receiver wiretap channel, which consists of two groups of users and a group of eavesdroppers.

It is known that the maximum achievable secrecy rate is obtained with the optimal transmit covariance matrix that maximizes the minimum difference between the channel mutual information of the secrecy user and those of the eavesdroppers. The maximum secrecy rate computation can thus be formulated as a non-convex max-min problem, which cannot be solved efficiently by existing methods. To handle this difficulty, this paper explores a new relationship between the secrecy channel and the recently developed cognitive radio (CR) channel, in which the secondary user transmits over the same spectrum simultaneously with multiple primary users, subject to the received interference power constraints at the primary users, or the so-called \u00bfinterference temperature (IT)\u00bf constraints. By constructing an auxiliary multi-antenna CR channel that has the same channel responses as the secrecy channel, this paper shows that the optimal transmit covariance to achieve the maximum secrecy rate is the same as that to achieve the CR spectrum sharing capacity with properly selected IT constraints. Thereby, finding the optimal complex transmit covariance matrix for the secrecy channel becomes equivalent to searching over a set of real IT constraints in the auxiliary CR channel. Based on this relationship, efficient algorithms are proposed to solve the non-convex secrecy rate maximization problem by transforming it into a sequence of convex CR spectrum sharing capacity computation problems, under various setups of the secrecy channel.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 47th Annual Allerton Conference on Communication, Control, and Computing

study a problem where wireless service providers compete for heterogenous and atomic (non-infinitesimal) wireless users. The users differ in their utility functions as well as in the perceived quality of service of individual providers. We model the interaction of an arbitrary number of providers and users as a two-stage multi-leader-follower game, and prove existence and uniqueness of the subgame perfect Nash equilibrium for a generic channel model and a wide class of users' utility functions. We show that, interestingly, the competition of resource providers leads to a globally optimal outcome under fairly general technical conditions. Our results show that some users need to purchase their resource from several providers at the equilibrium. While the number of such users is typically small (smaller than the number of providers), our simulations indicate that the percentage of cases where at least one undecided user exists can be significant.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5394532/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 30 2009-Oct. 2 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"22 January 2010","accessionNumber":"11089560","htmlLink":"/document/5394532/","conferenceDate":"30 Sept.-2 Oct. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Competition of wireless providers for atomic users: Equilibrium and social optimality","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Competition of wireless providers for atomic users: Equilibrium and social optimality","confLoc":"Monticello, IL, USA","sourcePdf":"1650143.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.087825S","chronDate":"Sept. 30 2009-Oct. 2 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5375733","isNumber":"5394483","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5375733","citationCount":"29","xplore-issue":"5394483","articleId":"5394532","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5394533,"authors":[{"name":"Phong S.

In this paper, we present a rate-distortion (R-D) approach to analyze these multiple-decoding algorithms for RS codes. This approach is first used to understand the asymptotic performance-versus-complexity trade-off of multiple error-and-erasure decoding of RS codes. By defining an appropriate distortion measure between an error pattern and an erasure pattern, the condition for a single error-and-erasure decoding to succeed reduces to a form where the distortion is compared to a fixed threshold. Finding the best set of erasure patterns for multiple decoding trials then turns out to be a covering problem which can be solved asymptotically by rate-distortion theory. Next, this approach is extended to analyze multiple algebraic soft-decision (ASD) decoding of RS codes. Both analytical and numerical computations of the R-D functions for the corresponding distortion measures are discussed. Simulation results show that proposed algorithms using this approach perform better than other algorithms with the same complexity.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Rate-distortion","Decoding","Reed-Solomon codes","Error correction codes","Variable speed drives","Distortion measurement","Interpolation","Algorithm design and analysis","Computational modeling","Digital communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decoding","Reed-Solomon codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["rate-distortion perspective","multiple decoding","Reed-Solomon codes","decoding algorithm","rate-distortion approach","asymptotic performance-versus-complexity trade-off","single error-and-erasure decoding","multiple algebraic soft-decision"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ALLERTON.2009.5394533","publicationTitle":"2009 47th Annual Allerton Conference on Communication, Control, and Computing (Allerton)","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 47th Annual Allerton Conference on Communication, Control, and Computing (Allerton)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5375733/5394483/05394533.pdf","startPage":"1235","endPage":"1242","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5394483","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ALLERTON.2009.5394533","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A rate-distortion perspective on multiple decoding attempts for Reed-Solomon codes","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5394533","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A rate-distortion perspective on multiple decoding attempts for Reed-Solomon codes","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5394533/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5394533/","accessionNumber":"11135223","conferenceDate":"30 Sept.-2 Oct. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"22 January 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 30 2009-Oct. 2 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A rate-distortion perspective on multiple decoding attempts for Reed-Solomon codes","confLoc":"Monticello, IL, USA","sourcePdf":"1700082.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049138S","chronDate":"Sept. 30 2009-Oct. 2 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5375733","isNumber":"5394483","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5375733","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5394483","articleId":"5394533","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5394536,"authors":[{"name":"Venkatesan Guruswami","affiliation":["The Computer Science Department, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Venkatesan","lastName":"Guruswami","id":"37284594300"},{"name":"James R.

Also of interest is minimization of the bandwidth required to repair the system following a node failure. In a recent paper, Wu et al. characterize the tradeoff between the repair bandwidth and the amount of data stored per node. They also prove the existence of regenerating codes that achieve this tradeoff. In this paper, we introduce Exact Regenerating Codes, which are regenerating codes possessing the additional property of being able to duplicate the data stored at a failed node. Such codes require low processing and communication overheads, making the system practical and easy to maintain. Explicit construction of exact regenerating codes is provided for the minimum bandwidth point on the storage-repair bandwidth tradeoff, relevant to distributed-mail-server applications. A subspace based approach is provided and shown to yield necessary and sufficient conditions on a linear code to possess the exact regeneration property as well as prove the uniqueness of our construction. Also included in the paper, is an explicit construction of regenerating codes for the minimum storage point for parameters relevant to storage in peer-to-peer systems. This construction supports a variable number of nodes and can handle multiple, simultaneous node failures. All constructions given in the paper are of low complexity, requiring low field size in particular.","doi":"10.1109/ALLERTON.2009.5394538","publicationTitle":"2009 47th Annual Allerton Conference on Communication, Control, and Computing (Allerton)","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 47th Annual Allerton Conference on Communication, Control, and Computing (Allerton)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5375733/5394483/05394538.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ALLERTON.2009.5394538","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5394483","startPage":"1243","endPage":"1249","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Explicit construction of optimal exact regenerating codes for distributed storage","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5394538","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Explicit construction of optimal exact regenerating codes for distributed storage","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 30 2009-Oct. 2 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5394538/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"30 Sept.-2 Oct. 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"11089562","dateOfInsertion":"22 January 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5394538/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Explicit construction of optimal exact regenerating codes for distributed storage","confLoc":"Monticello, IL, USA","sourcePdf":"1710136.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059734S","chronDate":"Sept. 30 2009-Oct. 2 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5375733","isNumber":"5394483","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5375733","citationCount":"170","xplore-issue":"5394483","articleId":"5394538","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5394577,"authors":[{"name":"M.

The key contribution of this paper is in adopting a new information-theoretic perspective on group testing problems. Establishing its connection to Shannon-coding theory, we formulate the group testing problem as a channel coding/decoding problem and derive a unifying result that reduces many of the interesting questions to computation of a mutual information expression. This result is fairly general; it allows us to verify existing bounds for some of the known scenarios and extend the analysis to many new interesting setups including noisy versions of group testing. Among the models we consider are the deterministic noise-free case, approximate reconstruction with bounded distortion, additive measurement noise, and dilution models.","doi":"10.1109/ALLERTON.2009.5394787","publicationTitle":"2009 47th Annual Allerton Conference on Communication, Control, and Computing (Allerton)","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 47th Annual Allerton Conference on Communication, Control, and Computing (Allerton)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5375733/5394483/05394787.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ALLERTON.2009.5394787","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5394483","startPage":"355","endPage":"362","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Noisy group testing: An information theoretic perspective","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5394787","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Noisy group testing: An information theoretic perspective","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 30 2009-Oct. 2 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5394787/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"30 Sept.-2 Oct. 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"11089568","dateOfInsertion":"22 January 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5394787/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Noisy group testing: An information theoretic perspective","confLoc":"Monticello, IL, USA","sourcePdf":"0490187.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.083004S","chronDate":"Sept. 30 2009-Oct. 2 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5375733","isNumber":"5394483","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5375733","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"5394483","articleId":"5394787","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5394791,"authors":[{"name":"Sang-Woon Jeon","affiliation":["School of EECS, KAIST, Daejeon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Sang-Woon","lastName":"Jeon","id":"37292894500"},{"name":"Sae-Young Chung","affiliation":["School of EECS, KAIST, Daejeon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Sae-Young","lastName":"Chung","id":"37291425800"},{"name":"Syed A.

A network management issue is studied, which addresses the best assignment of SUs to detecting PUs so that the overall probability of detection error is minimized.

In particular, systematic design of provably capacity achieving sequences of LDPC code ensembles over the general class of BIOSM channels, has remained a fundamental open problem. For the case of the binary erasure channel, explicit construction of capacity achieving sequences have been proposed based on a property called the flatness condition. In this paper, we propose a systematic method to design universally capacity approaching rate-compatible LDPC code ensemble sequences over BIOSM channels. This is achieved by interpreting the flatness condition over the BEC, as a successive maximization (SM) principle that is generalized to other BIOSM channels to design a sequence of capacity approaching ensembles called the parent sequence. The SM principle is then applied to each ensemble within the parent sequence, this time to design rate-compatible puncturing schemes. As part of our results, we extend the stability condition which was previously derived for degree-2 variable nodes to other variable node degrees as well as to the case of rate-compatible codes. Consequently, we rigorously prove that using the SM principle, one is able to design universally capacity achieving rate-compatible LDPC code ensemble sequences over the BEC. Unlike the previous results on such schemes over the BEC in the literature, the proposed SM approach is naturally extendable to other BIOSM channels. The performance of the rate-compatible schemes designed based on our systematic method is comparable to those designed by optimization.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 30 2009-Oct. 2 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5394793/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5394793/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11135239","conferenceDate":"30 Sept.-2 Oct. 2009","publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"22 January 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"On systematic design of universally capacity approaching rate-compatible sequences of LDPC code ensembles over binary-input output-symmetric memoryless channels","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On systematic design of universally capacity approaching rate-compatible sequences of LDPC code ensembles over binary-input output-symmetric memoryless channels","confLoc":"Monticello, IL, USA","sourcePdf":"0550226.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.170255S","chronDate":"Sept. 30 2009-Oct. 2 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5375733","isNumber":"5394483","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5375733","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5394483","articleId":"5394793","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5394794,"authors":[{"name":"Arvind Yedla","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Texas A and M University, College Station, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Arvind","lastName":"Yedla","id":"37591159900"},{"name":"Henry D.

In the current work we report our theoretical findings regarding the relation between the LDLC decoder and belief propagation. We show that the LDLC decoder is an instance of non-parametric belief propagation and further connect it to the Gaussian belief propagation algorithm. Our new results enable borrowing knowledge from the non-parametric and Gaussian belief propagation domains into the LDLC domain. Specifically, we give more general convergence conditions for convergence of the LDLC decoder (under the same assumptions of the original LDLC convergence analysis). We discuss how to extend the LDLC decoder from Latin square to full rank, non-square matrices. We propose an efficient construction of sparse generator matrix and its matching decoder. We report preliminary experimental results which show our decoder has comparable symbol to error rate compared to the original LDLC decoder.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Lattices","Belief propagation","Sparse matrices","Iterative decoding","Convergence","Parity check codes","Inference algorithms","Iterative algorithms","Graphical models","AWGN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decoding","parity check codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["low density lattice decoder","nonparametric belief propagation","low density lattice codes","AWGN channel","linear time iterative decoding","message-passing formulation","factor graph","LDLC decoder","Gaussian belief propagation algorithm","Gaussian belief propagation domain","LDLC domain","nonsquare matrices","sparse generator matrix","matching decoder"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ALLERTON.2009.5394798","publicationTitle":"2009 47th Annual Allerton Conference on Communication, Control, and Computing (Allerton)","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 47th Annual Allerton Conference on Communication, Control, and Computing (Allerton)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5375733/5394483/05394798.pdf","startPage":"439","endPage":"446","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5394483","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ALLERTON.2009.5394798","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A low density lattice decoder via non-parametric belief propagation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5394798","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A low density lattice decoder via non-parametric belief propagation","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5394798/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5394798/","accessionNumber":"11089572","conferenceDate":"30 Sept.-2 Oct. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"22 January 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 30 2009-Oct. 2 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A low density lattice decoder via non-parametric belief propagation","confLoc":"Monticello, IL, USA","sourcePdf":"0600102.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.09671S","chronDate":"Sept. 30 2009-Oct. 2 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5375733","isNumber":"5394483","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5375733","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"5394483","articleId":"5394798","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5394799,"authors":[{"name":"Soheil Feizi","affiliation":[" RLE, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, USA"],"firstName":"Soheil","lastName":"Feizi","id":"37392239200"},{"name":"Muriel M\u00e9dard","affiliation":[" RLE, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, USA"],"firstName":"Muriel","lastName":"M\u00e9dard","id":"37268947300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5871-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5870-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5394799","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":23,"totalDownloads":108},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"When do only sources need to compute? On functional compression in tree networks","abstract":"In this paper, we consider the problem of functional compression for an arbitrary tree network. Suppose we have k possibly correlated source processes in a tree network, and a receiver in its root wishes to compute a deterministic function of these processes. Other nodes of this tree (called intermediate nodes) are allowed to perform some computations to satisfy the node's demand. Our objective is to find a lower bound on feasible rates for different links of this tree network (called a rate lower bound) and propose a coding scheme to achieve this rate lower bound in some cases. The rate region of functional compression problem has been an open problem. However, it has been solved for some simple networks under some special conditions. For instance, Doshi et al. (2007) considered the rate region of a network with two transmitters and a receiver under a condition on source random variables. Here, we derive a rate lower bound for an arbitrary tree network based on the graph entropy. We introduce a new condition on colorings of source random variables' characteristic graphs called the coloring connectivity condition (C.C.C.). We show that unlike the condition mentioned in the work of Doshi et al. (2007), this condition is necessary and sufficient for any achievable coding scheme. We also show that unlike the entropy, the graph entropy does not satisfy the chain rule. For one stage trees with correlated sources, and general trees with independent sources, we propose a modularized coding scheme based on graph colorings to perform arbitrarily close to this rate lower bound. We show that in a general tree network case with independent sources, to achieve the rate lower bound, intermediate nodes should perform some computations. However, for a family of functions and RVs called coloring proper sets, it is sufficient to have intermediate nodes act like relays to perform arbitrarily close to the rate lower bound.","pdfPath":"/iel5/5375733/5394483/05394799.pdf","startPage":"447","endPage":"454","publicationTitle":"2009 47th Annual Allerton Conference on Communication, Control, and Computing (Allerton)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5394483","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ALLERTON.2009.5394799","doi":"10.1109/ALLERTON.2009.5394799","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 47th Annual Allerton Conference on Communication, Control, and Computing (Allerton)","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5394799","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Tree graphs","Computer networks","Entropy","Random variables","Transmitters","Relays","Network topology","Data compression"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data compression","encoding","entropy","graph colouring","receivers","transmitters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["functional compression","arbitrary tree network","receiver","intermediate node","rate region","transmitter","rate lower bound","graph entropy","graph coloring","source random variable","coloring connectivity condition","modularized coding scheme","coloring proper sets"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Functional compression","graph coloring","graph entropy"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 30 2009-Oct. 2 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5394799/","displayDocTitle":"When do only sources need to compute?

It becomes more challenging when nodes have finite energy. In this work, we propose a novel approach called network modulation (NeMo) to significantly improve the data persistence. Built on algebraic number theory, NeMo operates at the level of modulated symbols. Its core notion is to mix data at intermediate network nodes and meanwhile guarantee the symbol recovery at the sink(s) without pre-storing or waiting for other symbols. The persistence performance of NeMo has been evaluated by simulations to show that the proposed approach is efficient to enhance the data persistence for energy-constrained networks.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5394803/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 30 2009-Oct. 2 2009","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"30 Sept.-2 Oct. 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5394803/","dateOfInsertion":"22 January 2010","publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"11089574","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Enhancing data persistence for energy constrained networks by network modulation","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Enhancing data persistence for energy constrained networks by network modulation","confLoc":"Monticello, IL, USA","sourcePdf":"0300159.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070309S","chronDate":"Sept. 30 2009-Oct. 2 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5375733","isNumber":"5394483","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5375733","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5394483","articleId":"5394803","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5394806,"authors":[{"name":"Guy Bresler","affiliation":["Wireless Foundations, University of California Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Guy","lastName":"Bresler","id":"37540568300"},{"name":"David N.

A new framework for CS based on unions of subspaces can improve signal recovery by including dependencies between values and locations of the signal's significant coefficients. In this paper, we extend this framework to the acquisition of signal ensembles under a common sparse supports model. The new framework provides recovery algorithms with theoretical performance guarantees. Additionally, the framework scales naturally to large sensor networks: the number of measurements needed for each signal does not increase as the network becomes larger. Furthermore, the complexity of the recovery algorithm is only linear in the size of the network.

The tight outer bound is derived by extending a technique first developed in for single input output channels to interference channels. It is shown that even with a sophisticated time-sharing scheme among randomized fixed-composition codes, the capacity region of the randomized fixed-composition coding is not bigger than the known Han-Kobayashi capacity region. This suggests that the study of the average behavior of randomized codes are not sufficient in finding new capacity regions.","doi":"10.1109/ALLERTON.2009.5394808","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ALLERTON.2009.5394808","startPage":"280","endPage":"287","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 47th Annual Allerton Conference on Communication, Control, and Computing (Allerton)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5375733/5394483/05394808.pdf","publicationTitle":"2009 47th Annual Allerton Conference on Communication, Control, and Computing (Allerton)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5394483","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Interference channel capacity region for randomized fixed-composition codes","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 30 2009-Oct. 2 2009","displayDocTitle":"Interference channel capacity region for randomized fixed-composition codes","conferenceDate":"30 Sept.-2 Oct. 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"22 January 2010","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5394808/","accessionNumber":"11089577","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5394808/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Interference channel capacity region for randomized fixed-composition codes","confLoc":"Monticello, IL, USA","sourcePdf":"0390180.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066916S","chronDate":"Sept. 30 2009-Oct. 2 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5375733","isNumber":"5394483","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5375733","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5394483","articleId":"5394808","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5394811,"authors":[{"name":"Yi Cao","affiliation":["Department of EECS, Syracuse University, Syracuse, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Yi","lastName":"Cao","id":"37308770800"},{"name":"Biao Chen","affiliation":["Department of EECS, Syracuse University, Syracuse, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Biao","lastName":"Chen","id":"37280633800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5871-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5870-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5394811","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":16,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":172},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Relays","Interference channels","Decoding","Transmitters","Wireless mesh networks","Throughput","Land mobile radio cellular systems","Ad hoc networks","Mesh networks","MIMO"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decoding","encoding","Gaussian channels","receivers","switching networks","transmitters","wireless mesh networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["two hop interference networks","relay nodes","transmitters","receivers","Gaussian interference channel","decode and forward relaying","amplify and forward relaying","wireless mesh networks","bound capacity"]}],"abstract":"This paper considers a two-hop interference network, where two users transmit independent messages to their respective receivers with the help of two relay nodes.

In case of K-user IC with single polarization, the maximum achievable MUXG is K regardless of the number of transmit and receive antennas because of the key-hole effect. With polarization, a trivial upper bound on the MUXG is 2K. We propose a zero forcing (ZF) scheme for the \u00ed\u00ed-user LOS IC, where each user uses one or more polarimetric antennas. By using the proposed ZF scheme, we find minimal antenna configurations that achieve this bound for K \u2264 5.

There, the main interest is to identify a small number of infected people among a large population using collective samples. In viral epidemics, one way to acquire collective samples is by sending agents inside the population. While in classical group testing, it is assumed that the sampling procedure is fully known to the reconstruction algorithm, in this work we assume that the decoder possesses only partial knowledge about the sampling process. This assumption is justified by observing the fact that in a viral sickness, there is a chance that an agent remains healthy despite having contact with an infected person. Therefore, the reconstruction method has to cope with two different types of uncertainty; namely, identification of the infected population and the partially unknown sampling procedure. In this work, by using a natural probabilistic model for \u00bfviral infections\u00bf, we design non-adaptive sampling procedures that allow successful identification of the infected population with overwhelming probability 1 - o(1). We propose both probabilistic and explicit design procedures that require a \u00bfsmall\u00bf number of agents to single out the infected individuals.

For a length-N signal with sparsity K, merely M = O(K log N) \u00bf N random linear projections (measurements) can be used for robust reconstruction in polynomial time. Sparsity is a powerful and simple signal model; yet, richer models that impose additional structure on the sparse nonzeros of a signal have been studied theoretically and empirically from the CS perspective. In this work, we introduce and study a sparse signal model for streams of pulses, i.e., S-sparse signals convolved with an unknown F-sparse impulse response. Our contributions are threefold: (i) we geometrically model this set of signals as an infinite union of subspaces; (ii) we derive a sufficient number of random measurements M required to preserve the metric information of this set. In particular this number is linear merely in the number of degrees of freedom of the signal S + F, and sublinear in the sparsity K = SF; (iii) we develop an algorithm that performs recovery of the signal from M measurements and analyze its performance under noise and model mismatch. Numerical experiments on synthetic and real data demonstrate the utility of our proposed theory and algorithm. Our method is amenable to diverse applications such as the high-resolution sampling of neuronal recordings and ultra-wideband (UWB) signals.","doi":"10.1109/ALLERTON.2009.5394833","publicationTitle":"2009 47th Annual Allerton Conference on Communication, Control, and Computing (Allerton)","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 47th Annual Allerton Conference on Communication, Control, and Computing (Allerton)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5375733/5394483/05394833.pdf","startPage":"44","endPage":"51","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ALLERTON.2009.5394833","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5394483","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Compressive sensing of streams of pulses","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5394833","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 30 2009-Oct. 2 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5394833/","displayDocTitle":"Compressive sensing of streams of pulses","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"11089584","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5394833/","conferenceDate":"30 Sept.-2 Oct. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"22 January 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Compressive sensing of streams of pulses","confLoc":"Monticello, IL, USA","sourcePdf":"0070111.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054223S","chronDate":"Sept. 30 2009-Oct. 2 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5375733","isNumber":"5394483","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5375733","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"5394483","articleId":"5394833","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5394834,"authors":[{"name":"Radu Berinde","affiliation":["MIT"],"firstName":"Radu","lastName":"Berinde","id":"38109513300"},{"name":"Piotr Indyk","affiliation":["MIT"],"firstName":"Piotr","lastName":"Indyk","id":"37370561100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5871-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5870-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5394834","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":27,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":273},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Matching pursuit algorithms","Sparse matrices","Convergence","Iterative algorithms","EMP radiation effects","Pursuit algorithms","Approximation algorithms","Vectors","Minimization methods","Noise measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["approximation theory","iterative methods","signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["sequential sparse matching pursuit","sparse recovery problem solving","k-sparse approximation","arbitrary n-dimensional signal vector","linear measurements","image data","synthetic data"]}],"abstract":"We propose a new algorithm, called sequential sparse matching pursuit (SSMP), for solving sparse recovery problems.

The asymptotic scaling of the number of measurements needed for reconstruction as the dimension of the signal increases has been studied extensively. This work takes a fundamental perspective on the problem of inferring about individual elements of the sparse signal given the measurements, where the dimensions of the system become increasingly large. Using the replica method, the outcome of inferring about any fixed collection of signal elements is shown to be asymptotically decoupled, i.e., those elements become independent conditioned on the measurements. Furthermore, the problem of inferring about each signal element admits a single-letter characterization in the sense that the posterior distribution of the element, which is a sufficient statistic, becomes asymptotically identical to the posterior of inferring about the same element in scalar Gaussian noise. The result leads to simple characterization of all other elemental metrics of the compressed sensing problem, such as the mean squared error and the error probability for reconstructing the support set of the sparse signal. Finally, the single-letter characterization is rigorously justified in the special case of sparse measurement matrices where belief propagation becomes asymptotically optimal.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A single-letter characterization of optimal noisy compressed sensing","publicationTitle":"2009 47th Annual Allerton Conference on Communication, Control, and Computing (Allerton)","doi":"10.1109/ALLERTON.2009.5394838","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 47th Annual Allerton Conference on Communication, Control, and Computing (Allerton)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5375733/5394483/05394838.pdf","startPage":"52","endPage":"59","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ALLERTON.2009.5394838","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5394483","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5394838","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5394838/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 30 2009-Oct. 2 2009","displayDocTitle":"A single-letter characterization of optimal noisy compressed sensing","conferenceDate":"30 Sept.-2 Oct. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5394838/","dateOfInsertion":"22 January 2010","publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"11135261","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A single-letter characterization of optimal noisy compressed sensing","confLoc":"Monticello, IL, USA","sourcePdf":"0080154.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073611S","chronDate":"Sept. 30 2009-Oct. 2 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5375733","isNumber":"5394483","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5375733","citationCount":"32","xplore-issue":"5394483","articleId":"5394838","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5394841,"authors":[{"name":"Hieu T.

The first scenario is a noisy interference regime, where we show that interference can be aligned with random codes, obviating the need of structured codes. The second scenario is over the many-to-one interference channels where alignment is precluded because the multiple interferers are resolvable at the receiver which faces interference.","doi":"10.1109/ALLERTON.2009.5394842","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ALLERTON.2009.5394842","startPage":"67","endPage":"74","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 47th Annual Allerton Conference on Communication, Control, and Computing (Allerton)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5375733/5394483/05394842.pdf","publicationTitle":"2009 47th Annual Allerton Conference on Communication, Control, and Computing (Allerton)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5394483","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Interference alignment via random codes and he capacity of a class of deterministic interference channels","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 30 2009-Oct. 2 2009","displayDocTitle":"Interference alignment via random codes and he capacity of a class of deterministic interference channels","conferenceDate":"30 Sept.-2 Oct. 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"22 January 2010","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5394842/","accessionNumber":"11089586","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5394842/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Interference alignment via random codes and he capacity of a class of deterministic interference channels","confLoc":"Monticello, IL, USA","sourcePdf":"0100089.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068287S","chronDate":"Sept. 30 2009-Oct. 2 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5375733","isNumber":"5394483","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5375733","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5394483","articleId":"5394842","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5394846,"authors":[{"name":"Lalitha Sankar","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Princeton University, Princeton, NJ, USA"],"firstName":"Lalitha","lastName":"Sankar","id":"37320277200"},{"name":"Jan Vondrak","affiliation":["Department of Mathematics, Princeton University, USA"],"firstName":"Jan","lastName":"Vondrak","id":"37281637200"},{"name":"H.

Herein, control strategies which enable the superposition in time and frequency of primary and secondary user transmissions are explored in contrast to more traditional sensing approaches which only allow the secondary user to transmit when the primary user is idle. In this work, the optimal transmission policy for the secondary user when the primary user adopts a retransmission based error control scheme is investigated. Thus, the policy of the secondary user determines how often it transmits according to the retransmission state of the packet being served by the primary user. The resulting optimal strategy of the secondary user is proven to have a unique structure. In particular, the optimal throughput is achieved by the secondary user by concentrating its interference to the primary user in the first transmissions of a packet.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cognitive interference management in retransmission-based wireless networks","publicationTitle":"2009 47th Annual Allerton Conference on Communication, Control, and Computing (Allerton)","doi":"10.1109/ALLERTON.2009.5394850","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 47th Annual Allerton Conference on Communication, Control, and Computing (Allerton)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5375733/5394483/05394850.pdf","startPage":"94","endPage":"101","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ALLERTON.2009.5394850","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5394483","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5394850","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5394850/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 30 2009-Oct. 2 2009","displayDocTitle":"Cognitive interference management in retransmission-based wireless networks","conferenceDate":"30 Sept.-2 Oct. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5394850/","dateOfInsertion":"22 January 2010","publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"11089588","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cognitive interference management in retransmission-based wireless networks","confLoc":"Monticello, IL, USA","sourcePdf":"0140282.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065834S","chronDate":"Sept. 30 2009-Oct. 2 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5375733","isNumber":"5394483","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5375733","citationCount":"30","xplore-issue":"5394483","articleId":"5394850","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5394854,"authors":[{"name":"Mihalis G.

While there is a large and growing literature on techniques for detecting network anomalies, there has been little or no treatment of what to do after a candidate anomaly has been identified. In this paper, we present a first step toward formalizing and automating the time-consuming and challenging tasks associated with network anomaly confirmation, diagnosis and remedy. Our work assumes that potential anomalies are identified either through visual analysis of key traffic measurements or from a Network Anomaly Detection System (NADS). We describe a flexible framework for network anomaly confirmation, diagnosis and remedy that is based on workflow concepts. The key features of this framework include data types/sources, analyses and decision points. We present an instantiation of our framework that includes a taxonomy of network traffic anomalies and detailed steps for confirmation of anomalies associated with malicious attacks. We demonstrate our framework by applying it to traffic in our university network. We propose that our framework is a starting point for streamlining operational tasks associated with traffic anomalies, and for the generation of annotated data sets that can be used in future NADS development.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 47th Annual Allerton Conference on Communication, Control, and Computing (Allerton)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5375733/5394483/05394858.pdf","startPage":"128","endPage":"135","publicationTitle":"2009 47th Annual Allerton Conference on Communication, Control, and Computing (Allerton)","doi":"10.1109/ALLERTON.2009.5394858","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ALLERTON.2009.5394858","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5394483","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5394858","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Network anomaly confirmation, diagnosis and remediation","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Telecommunication traffic","Taxonomy","Electronic mail","Large-scale systems","Manufacturing processes","Queueing analysis","History","Operations research","Information technology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["telecommunication security","telecommunication traffic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["network traffic","network anomaly detection system","confirmation","diagnosis","remediation","taxonomy","malicious attacks"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5394858/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 30 2009-Oct. 2 2009","displayDocTitle":"Network anomaly confirmation, diagnosis and remediation","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5394858/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"11089590","dateOfInsertion":"22 January 2010","conferenceDate":"30 Sept.-2 Oct. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Network anomaly confirmation, diagnosis and remediation","confLoc":"Monticello, IL, USA","sourcePdf":"0180355.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.078249S","chronDate":"Sept. 30 2009-Oct. 2 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5375733","isNumber":"5394483","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5375733","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"5394483","articleId":"5394858","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-29"},{"_id":5394863,"authors":[{"name":"Sungho Yun","affiliation":["Wireless Networking & Communications Group, Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Texas, Austin, Austin, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Sungho","lastName":"Yun","id":"37396691500"},{"name":"Constantine Caramanis","affiliation":["Wireless Networking & Communications Group, Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Texas, Austin, Austin, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Constantine","lastName":"Caramanis","id":"37294840300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5871-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5870-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5394863","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":11,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":334},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Support vector machines","Machine learning algorithms","OFDM","Modulation coding","Throughput","Mathematical model","MIMO","Wireless communication","Transmitters","Fading"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO communication","OFDM modulation","support vector machines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiclass support vector machine","MIMO-OFDM wireless system","transmitter parameter","modulation order","coding rate","link adaptation","machine learning","performance-optimal classifier"]}],"abstract":"In MIMO-OFDM systems, by matching transmitter parameters such as modulation order and coding rate, link adaptation can increase the throughput significantly. However, creating a tractable mathematical mapping model from environmental variables to transmitter parameters that allows the latter to be optimized in any sense, presents serious challenges due to the large number of variables involved, as well as the complexity required in any model with the ability to accurately capture and explain all factors that affect performance. Machine learning algorithms, which make no mathematical assumptions and use only past observations to model the input-output relationship, have recently been explored for adaptation in MIMO-OFDM systems. In this paper we propose a novel machine learning algorithm based on multi-class support vector machines (SVMs). Our algorithm has considerably smaller operational overhead (including storage requirements) and better performance for link adaptation. With IEEE 802.11n simulations we show that our new algorithm outperforms existing machine-learning based algorithms. Moreover, we show that our algorithm is (asymptotically) consistent, in the sense that as the number of training data used increases, our algorithm obtains the performance-optimal classifier.","doi":"10.1109/ALLERTON.2009.5394863","publicationTitle":"2009 47th Annual Allerton Conference on Communication, Control, and Computing (Allerton)","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 47th Annual Allerton Conference on Communication, Control, and Computing (Allerton)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5375733/5394483/05394863.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ALLERTON.2009.5394863","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5394483","startPage":"1145","endPage":"1152","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multiclass support vector machines for adaptation in MIMO-OFDM wireless systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5394863","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Multiclass support vector machines for adaptation in MIMO-OFDM wireless systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 30 2009-Oct. 2 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5394863/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"30 Sept.-2 Oct. 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"11089592","dateOfInsertion":"22 January 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5394863/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multiclass support vector machines for adaptation in MIMO-OFDM wireless systems","confLoc":"Monticello, IL, USA","sourcePdf":"1580267.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.095678S","chronDate":"Sept. 30 2009-Oct. 2 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5375733","isNumber":"5394483","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5375733","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"5394483","articleId":"5394863","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5394864,"authors":[{"name":"Mustafa Cenk Gursoy","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Nebraska, Lincoln, Lincolnshire, NE, USA"],"firstName":"Mustafa Cenk","lastName":"Gursoy","id":"37283386500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5871-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5870-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5394864","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":90},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Wireless communication","Wideband","Transmitters","Fading","Receiving antennas","Transmitting antennas","Probability","Information analysis","Throughput"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel capacity","fading channels","MIMO communication","multipath channels","probability","queueing theory","radio transmitters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO wireless communication","statistical queueing constraint","multiple-input multiple-output wireless system","buffer violation probability","effective capacity formulation","wideband regime","low-power analysis","channel state information","transmitter","transmission strategy","energy efficiency analysis","minimum bit energy","multipath fading"]}],"abstract":"The performance of multiple-input multiple-output wireless systems is investigated in the presence of statistical queueing constraints. Queuing constraints are imposed as limitations on buffer violation probabilities. The performance under such constraints is captured through the effective capacity formulation. A detailed analysis of the effective capacity is carried out in the low-power and wideband regimes. In the low-power analysis, expressions for the first and second derivatives of the effective capacity with respect to SNR at SNR = 0 are obtained under various assumptions on the degree of channel state information at the transmitter. Transmission strategies that are optimal in the sense of achieving the first and second derivatives are identified. It is shown that while the first derivative does not get affected by the presence of queueing constraints, the second derivative gets smaller as the constraints become more stringent. Through the energy efficiency analysis, this is shown to imply that the minimum bit energy requirements do not change with more strict limitations but the wideband slope diminishes. Similar results are obtained in the wideband regime if rich multipath fading is being experienced.

No information regarding the eavesdropper is presumed at the transmitter, and we examine both the broadcast MIMO downlink with independent information, and the multicast MIMO downlink with common information for all legitimate receivers. In both cases the information signal is transmitted with just enough power to guarantee a certain SINR at the desired receivers, while the remainder of the power is used to broadcast artificial noise. The artificial interference selectively degrades the passive eavesdropper's signal while remaining orthogonal to the desired receivers. We analyze the confidentiality provided by zero-forcing and optimal minimum-power beamforming designs for the broadcast channel, and optimal minimum-MSE beamformers for the multicast channel. Numerical simulations for the relative SINR and BER performance of the eavesdropper demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed physical-layer security schemes.","doi":"10.1109/ALLERTON.2009.5394865","publicationTitle":"2009 47th Annual Allerton Conference on Communication, Control, and Computing (Allerton)","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 47th Annual Allerton Conference on Communication, Control, and Computing (Allerton)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5375733/5394483/05394865.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ALLERTON.2009.5394865","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5394483","startPage":"1134","endPage":"1141","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Utility of beamforming strategies for secrecy in multiuser MIMO wiretap channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5394865","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Utility of beamforming strategies for secrecy in multiuser MIMO wiretap channels","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 30 2009-Oct. 2 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5394865/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"30 Sept.-2 Oct. 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"11089594","dateOfInsertion":"22 January 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5394865/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Utility of beamforming strategies for secrecy in multiuser MIMO wiretap channels","confLoc":"Monticello, IL, USA","sourcePdf":"1560245.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073512S","chronDate":"Sept. 30 2009-Oct. 2 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5375733","isNumber":"5394483","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5375733","citationCount":"42","xplore-issue":"5394483","articleId":"5394865","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5394866,"authors":[{"name":"Mahmoud Taherzadeh","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Princeton University, Engineering Quadrangle, Princeton, NJ, USA"],"firstName":"Mahmoud","lastName":"Taherzadeh","id":"37283643100"},{"name":"H.

Later, in papers by Candes and Tao and Rudelson and Vershynin, it was shown that (random) subsampling of the rows of many other classes of unitary matrices also yield effective sensing matrices. The key requirement is that the rows of U, the unitary matrix, must be highly incoherent with the basis in which the signal is sparse. In this paper, we consider acquisition systems that - despite sensing sparse signals in an incoherent domain - cannot randomly subsample rows from U. We consider a general class of systems in which the sensing matrix corresponds to subsampling of the rows of matrices of the form \u00bf = RU (instead of U), where R is typically a low-rank matrix whose structure reflects the physical/technological constraints of the acquisition system. We use the term \u00bfstructurally-subsampled unitary matrices\u00bf to describe such sensing matrices. We investigate the restricted isometry property of a particular class of structurally-subsampled unitary matrices that arise naturally in application areas such as multiple-antenna channel estimation and sub-nyquist sampling. In addition, we discuss an immediate application of this work in the area of wireless channel estimation, where the main results of this paper can be applied to the estimation of multiple-antenna orthogonal frequency division multiplexing channels that have sparse impulse responses.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5394883/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 30 2009-Oct. 2 2009","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"30 Sept.-2 Oct. 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5394883/","dateOfInsertion":"22 January 2010","publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"11089499","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A restricted isometry property for structurally-subsampled unitary matrices","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A restricted isometry property for structurally-subsampled unitary matrices","confLoc":"Monticello, IL, USA","sourcePdf":"1380329.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.081892S","chronDate":"Sept. 30 2009-Oct. 2 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5375733","isNumber":"5394483","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5375733","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"5394483","articleId":"5394883","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5394904,"authors":[{"name":"Yaniv Erlich","affiliation":["Watson School of Biological Science, Cold Spring Harbor Lab"],"firstName":"Yaniv","lastName":"Erlich","id":"37394162500"},{"name":"Noam Shental","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, The Open Univ. of Israel"],"firstName":"Noam","lastName":"Shental","id":"37399822000"},{"name":"Amnon Amir","firstName":"Amnon","lastName":"Amir","id":"37411137600"},{"name":"Or Zuk","firstName":"Or","lastName":"Zuk","id":"37399822700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5871-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5870-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5394904","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":146},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Compressed sensing","Throughput","DNA","Sequences","Decoding","Belief propagation","Genomics","Bioinformatics","Genetic mutations","Optical microscopy"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bioinformatics","biological techniques","biomedical measurement","genetics","message passing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compressed sensing approach","medical genetics","rare genetic disorders","ultrahigh throughput carrier screens","rare genetic disease carriers","Ashkenazi Jews","decoding performance","GPSR","gradient projection for sparse reconstruction","belief propagation"]}],"abstract":"Carrier screens are widely used in medical genetics to prevent rare genetic disorders.

The implementation integrates three compatible decoding algorithms in a single decoder. The three decoding algorithms are the one-step majority-logic decoding (OS-MLGD) algorithm and two iterative binary message passing algorithms (IBMP) derived from the OS-MLGD algorithm, one based on soft reliability information and the other on hard reliability information. All three algorithms requires only binary logical operations, integer additions, and single-bit messages, which makes them significantly less complex in terms of hardware requirements than sum-product algorithm, with a very modest loss in performance. The implementation is based on the partially parallel architecture and is optimized to take advantage of the high-speed dual-ported block RAMs in a Xilinx Virtex-4 FPGA. An optimization called memory sharing is introduced to take advantage of the configurable data width (word size) of the block RAMs to accommodate the 262080 edges in the Tanner graph of the (4095,3367) code. A technique is introduced to decode two codewords simultaneously to take advantage of the depth of the block RAMs. As a result, the proposed implementation achieves a throughput of 1.9 Gbps on a Virtex-4 LX160 FPGA and supports bit-error rate simulation down to 10\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">-11</sup>\n in a day or so.","doi":"10.1109/ALLERTON.2009.5394917","publicationTitle":"2009 47th Annual Allerton Conference on Communication, Control, and Computing (Allerton)","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 47th Annual Allerton Conference on Communication, Control, and Computing (Allerton)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5375733/5394483/05394917.pdf","startPage":"600","endPage":"606","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5394483","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ALLERTON.2009.5394917","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"FPGA-based low-complexity high-throughput tri-mode decoder for quasi-cyclic LDPC codes","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5394917","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 30 2009-Oct. 2 2009","displayDocTitle":"FPGA-based low-complexity high-throughput tri-mode decoder for quasi-cyclic LDPC codes","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5394917/","publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"22 January 2010","accessionNumber":"11135178","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5394917/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"30 Sept.-2 Oct. 2009","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FPGA-based low-complexity high-throughput tri-mode decoder for quasi-cyclic LDPC codes","confLoc":"Monticello, IL, USA","sourcePdf":"0820055.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070703S","chronDate":"Sept. 30 2009-Oct. 2 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5375733","isNumber":"5394483","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5375733","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"5394483","articleId":"5394917","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5394921,"authors":[{"name":"Serdar Y\u00fcksel","affiliation":["Mathematics and Engineering Program, Department of Mathematics and Statistics, Queen''s University, Kingston, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Serdar","lastName":"Y\u00fcksel","id":"37299714200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5871-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5870-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5394921","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":10,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":56},"abstract":"A random time state-dependent drift result leading to various forms of stochastic stability for a Markov Chain is presented.

When the channel is time-varying with memory, however, selected codeword may become outdated before its use at the transmitter. To overcome this problem, we propose a Grassmannian prediction and predictive coding framework for delayed feedback systems by exploiting the memory in the channel.

When the network is under a central authority, energy allocations and cooperative pairings can be assigned to optimize the overall energy efficiency of the network. In networks with autonomous selfish nodes, however, nodes may not be willing to expend energy to relay messages for others. This problem has been previously addressed through the development of extrinsic incentive mechanisms, e.g. virtual currency, or the insertion of altruistic nodes in the network to enforce cooperative behavior. This paper considers the problem of how selfish nodes can decide on an efficient energy allocation and endogenously form cooperative partnerships in wireless networks without extrinsic incentive mechanisms or altruistic nodes. Using tools from both cooperative and non-cooperative game theory, the three main contributions of this paper are (i) the development of Pareto-efficient cooperative energy allocations that can be agreed upon by selfish nodes, based on axiomatic bargaining techniques, (ii) the development of necessary and sufficient conditions under which \u00bfnatural\u00bf cooperation is possible in systems with fading and non-fading channels without extrinsic incentive mechanisms or altruistic nodes, and (iii) the development of techniques to endogenously form cooperative partnerships without central control. Numerical results with orthogonal amplify-and-forward (OAF) cooperation are also provided to quantify the energy efficiency of a wireless network with sources selfishly allocating transmission/relaying energy and endogenously forming cooperative partnerships with respect to a network with centrally optimized energy allocations and pairing assignments.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 47th Annual Allerton Conference on Communication, Control, and Computing (Allerton)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5375733/5394483/05394955.pdf","startPage":"879","endPage":"886","publicationTitle":"2009 47th Annual Allerton Conference on Communication, Control, and Computing (Allerton)","doi":"10.1109/ALLERTON.2009.5394955","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ALLERTON.2009.5394955","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5394483","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5394955","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the endogenous formation of energy efficient cooperative wireless networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Energy efficiency","Wireless networks","Relays","Game theory","Sufficient conditions","Mobile ad hoc networks","Computer networks","Reliability engineering","Power engineering and energy","Computer network reliability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["diversity reception","game theory","radio networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cooperative wireless networks","cooperative relays","intermediate nodes","energy allocation","cooperative partnership","pairing assignment","autonomous selfish nodes","extrinsic incentive mechanisms","altruistic nodes","non-cooperative game theory","axiomatic bargaining","orthogonal amplify-and-forward cooperation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5394955/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 30 2009-Oct. 2 2009","displayDocTitle":"On the endogenous formation of energy efficient cooperative wireless networks","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5394955/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"11089529","dateOfInsertion":"22 January 2010","conferenceDate":"30 Sept.-2 Oct. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the endogenous formation of energy efficient cooperative wireless networks","confLoc":"Monticello, IL, USA","sourcePdf":"1200203.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069115S","chronDate":"Sept. 30 2009-Oct. 2 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5375733","isNumber":"5394483","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5375733","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"5394483","articleId":"5394955","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5394956,"authors":[{"name":"Yilin Mo","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Yilin","lastName":"Mo","id":"37605284400"},{"name":"Bruno Sinopoli","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Bruno","lastName":"Sinopoli","id":"37265687500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5871-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5870-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5394956","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":384,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":4707},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Control systems","Computer crime","Communication system control","Robust control","Steady-state","Detectors","National security","Detection algorithms","Video recording","Aerodynamics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["discrete time systems","linear quadratic Gaussian control","security of data"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["secure control","replay attacks","control system","sensors","discrete time linear time invariant Gaussian system","linear quadratic Gaussian controller","failure detector"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5394956","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 47th Annual Allerton Conference on Communication, Control, and Computing (Allerton)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5375733/5394483/05394956.pdf","startPage":"911","endPage":"918","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ALLERTON.2009.5394956","doi":"10.1109/ALLERTON.2009.5394956","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5394483","publicationTitle":"2009 47th Annual Allerton Conference on Communication, Control, and Computing (Allerton)","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Secure control against replay attacks","abstract":"This paper analyzes the effect of replay attacks on a control system. We assume an attacker wishes to disrupt the operation of a control system in steady state. In order to inject an exogenous control input without being detected the attacker will hijack the sensors, observe and record their readings for a certain amount of time and repeat them afterwards while carrying out his attack. This is a very common and natural attack (we have seen numerous times intruders recording and replaying security videos while performing their attack undisturbed) for an attacker who does not know the dynamics of the system but is aware of the fact that the system itself is expected to be in steady state for the duration of the attack. We assume the control system to be a discrete time linear time invariant gaussian system applying an infinite horizon Linear Quadratic Gaussian (LQG) controller. We also assume that the system is equipped with a \u00bf\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n failure detector.

The aim is to produce a fuzzy system for color classification and image segmentation with least number of rules and minimum error rate. Fuzzy sets are defined on the H, S and L components of the HSL color. Particle swarm optimization is a sub class of evolutionary algorithms that has been inspired from social behavior of fishes, bees, birds, etc, that live together in colonies. During evolution, a population member tries to maximize a fitness criterion which is here high classification rate and small number of rules. Finally, particle with the highest fitness value is selected as the best set of fuzzy rules for image segmentation.

MUSIC estimates the number of incident signals on the array and their directions of arrival. It also gives the direction of arrival of desired signal. The Minimum Variance Distortion less Response (MVDR) is a very well known algorithm to obtain the optimum weight vector, which maximizes the output signal to noise and interference ratio (SNIR) of multiple antennas. The LMS algorithm, which has been simulated, is a simple yet efficient technique for robust adaptive beamforming. The LMS algorithm recursively computes and updates the weight vector. It has been observed that LMS algorithm gives the response for the two different DOA estimation algorithms MUSIC & MVDR depending upon the DOA estimations.As the signals are randomly generated the response of LMS algorithm differ for some cases of DOA estimations using MUSIC & MVDR otherwise it gives same response for both the algorithms. The algorithms have been simulated in MATLAB 7.4 version. A simulation tool with a graphical user interface, which implements these algorithms, is developed. Results of numerical simulation are useful for the design of smart antennas systems with optimal performance.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5395024/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-18 Dec. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"22 January 2010","accessionNumber":"11104727","htmlLink":"/document/5395024/","conferenceDate":"16-18 Dec. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Robust Algorithms for DOA Estimation and Adaptive Beamforming for Smart Antenna Application","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust Algorithms for DOA Estimation and Adaptive Beamforming for Smart Antenna Application","confLoc":"Nagpur, India","sourcePdf":"pid982882.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056955S","chronDate":"16-18 Dec. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5394476","isNumber":"5394994","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5394476","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"5394994","articleId":"5395024","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5395048,"authors":[{"name":"M.

These data were obtained from the University of Wisconsin Hospitals, Madison. The dataset consist of thirty features which represent the input layer to the PNN. The PNN will classify the input features into benign and malignant. The sensitivity, specificity and accuracy were found to be equal 97.5%, 92.5% and 96.2% respectively. It can be concluded that PNN gives fast and accurate classification and it works as promising tool for classification of breast cell nuclei.","doi":"10.1109/DeSE.2009.31","startPage":"101","endPage":"106","publicationTitle":"2009 Second International Conference on Developments in eSystems Engineering","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DeSE.2009.31","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5395080","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Second International Conference on Developments in eSystems Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/5394474/5395080/05395095.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Probabilistic Neural Network for Breast Biopsy Classification","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5395095/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Probabilistic Neural Network for Breast Biopsy Classification","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5395095/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11088787","publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"22 January 2010","conferenceDate":"14-16 Dec. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-16 Dec. 2009","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Probabilistic Neural Network for Breast Biopsy Classification","confLoc":"Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates","sourcePdf":"3912a101.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.088421S","chronDate":"14-16 Dec. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5394474","isNumber":"5395080","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5394474","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5395080","articleId":"5395095","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5395114,"authors":[{"name":"M.

In this regard the challenge is how to implement self-healing systems in real time, since online learning is required so that the running system is tuned and adapted automatically, based on the current changes of the system's behavior. In this paper, to overcome the challenges associated with self-healing comprising monitoring, interpretation, resolution, and adaptation (MIRA); a novel technique is implemented using pipelined recursive neural networks (PRNN) with a modification of the original algorithm. This method enables us to deal with several independent signals instead of one input; also on the fly learning is achieved in order to address the problems of providing system self-healing. For example instigating continuous learning rather that supervised learning which is not suitable for real systems. Traditional Predefined methods were used, but in this paper an external approach of self-adaptation is implemented to suit the changes of real time systems.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-16 Dec. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5395114/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11134242","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5395114/","publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"22 January 2010","conferenceDate":"14-16 Dec. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Using Adaptive Neural Networks in Self-Healing Systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Using Adaptive Neural Networks in Self-Healing Systems","confLoc":"Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates","sourcePdf":"3912a227.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049495S","chronDate":"14-16 Dec. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5394474","isNumber":"5395080","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5394474","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5395080","articleId":"5395114","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5395136,"authors":[{"name":"Radha Thangaraj","affiliation":["Indian Institute of Technology Roorkee, India"],"firstName":"Radha","lastName":"Thangaraj","id":"37602969200"},{"name":"Millie Pant","affiliation":["Indian Institute of Technology Roorkee, India"],"firstName":"Millie","lastName":"Pant","id":"37603464400"},{"name":"Atulya K.

The new proposed neural network is called dynamic ridge polynomial neural network that combines the properties of higher order and recurrent neural networks. The advantage of this type of network is that it exploits the properties of higher-order neural networks by functionally extending the input space into a higher dimensional space, where linear separability is possible, without suffering from the combinatorial explosion in the number of weights. Furthermore, the network has a regular structure, since the order can be suitably augmented by additional sigma units. Finally, the presence of the recurrent link expands the network's ability for attractor dynamics and storing information for later use. The performance of the network is tested for the prediction of nonlinear and nonstationary time series. Two popular time series, the Lorenz attractor and the mean value of the AE index, are used in our studies. The simulation results showed better results in terms of the signal to noise ratio in comparison to a number of higher order and feedforward networks.","doi":"10.1109/DeSE.2009.35","startPage":"354","endPage":"363","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Second International Conference on Developments in eSystems Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/5394474/5395080/05395144.pdf","publicationTitle":"2009 Second International Conference on Developments in eSystems Engineering","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DeSE.2009.35","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5395080","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Time Series Prediction Using Dynamic Ridge Polynomial Neural Networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Polynomials","Neural networks","Recurrent neural networks","Feedforward neural networks","Predictive models","Testing","Economic forecasting","Artificial neural networks","Nonlinear dynamical systems","Autoregressive processes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neural net architecture","prediction theory","recurrent neural nets","time series"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["time series prediction","dynamic ridge polynomial neural networks","higher order polynomial neural network architecture","recurrent neural networks","nonstationary time series","nonlinear time series","Lorenz attractor","AE index mean value","signal to noise ratio","feedforward neural networks","high dimensional space"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5395144/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-16 Dec. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Time Series Prediction Using Dynamic Ridge Polynomial Neural Networks","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5395144/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"22 January 2010","conferenceDate":"14-16 Dec. 2009","accessionNumber":"11088808","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Time Series Prediction Using Dynamic Ridge Polynomial Neural Networks","confLoc":"Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates","sourcePdf":"3912a354.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.108808S","chronDate":"14-16 Dec. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5394474","isNumber":"5395080","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5394474","citationCount":"27","xplore-issue":"5395080","articleId":"5395144","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5395147,"authors":[{"name":"Naeem Radi","affiliation":["Al-Kawarizmi International College, Liverpool John Moores University, Liverpool, UK"],"firstName":"Naeem","lastName":"Radi","id":"38368013300"},{"name":"Abir Jaafar Hussain","affiliation":["Al-Kawarizmi International College, Liverpool John Moores University, Liverpool, UK"],"firstName":"Abir Jaafar","lastName":"Hussain","id":"37286675800"},{"name":"Dhiya Al-Jumeily","affiliation":["Al-Kawarizmi International College, Liverpool John Moores University, Liverpool, UK"],"firstName":"Dhiya","lastName":"Al-Jumeily","id":"38271128600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5402-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5401-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5395147","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":99},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5395147","abstract":"The use of neural networks as a nonlinear predictor in many applications including predictive image coding has been successfully presented by many researchers.

One of the main problems of using appearance-based discriminative models is the ambiguities among classes when the number of persons being considered increases. To reduce the amount of ambiguity, we propose the use of a rich set of feature descriptors based on color, textures and edges. Another issue regarding appearance modeling is the limited number of training samples available for each appearance. The discriminative models are created using a powerful statistical tool called partial least squares (PLS), responsible for weighting the features according to their discriminative power for each different appearance. The experimental results, based on appearance-based person recognition, demonstrate that the use of an enriched feature set analyzed by PLS reduces the ambiguity among different appearances and provides higher recognition rates when compared to other machine learning techniques.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Learning Discriminative Appearance-Based Models Using Partial Least Squares","publicationTitle":"2009 XXII Brazilian Symposium on Computer Graphics and Image Processing","doi":"10.1109/SIBGRAPI.2009.42","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 XXII Brazilian Symposium on Computer Graphics and Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5394479/5395157/05395183.pdf","startPage":"322","endPage":"329","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SIBGRAPI.2009.42","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5395157","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5395183","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5395183/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-15 Oct. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Learning Discriminative Appearance-Based Models Using Partial Least Squares","conferenceDate":"11-15 Oct. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5395183/","dateOfInsertion":"22 January 2010","publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","accessionNumber":"11088541","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Learning Discriminative Appearance-Based Models Using Partial Least Squares","confLoc":"Rio de Janeiro, Brazil","sourcePdf":"3813a322.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064556S","chronDate":"11-15 Oct. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5394479","isNumber":"5395157","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5394479","citationCount":"239","xplore-issue":"5395157","articleId":"5395183","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-19"},{"_id":5395223,"authors":[{"name":"Ana Paula Abrantes de Castro","affiliation":["S\u00e3o Jos\u00e9 dos Campos, Instituto Nacional de Pesquisas Espaciais - INPE, SP, Brasil"],"firstName":"Ana Paula Abrantes de","lastName":"Castro","id":"37085977074"},{"name":"Jos\u00e9 Demisio Sim\u00f5es da Silva","affiliation":["S\u00e3o Jos\u00e9 dos Campos, Instituto Nacional de Pesquisas Espaciais - INPE, SP, Brasil"],"firstName":"Jos\u00e9 Demisio Sim\u00f5es da","lastName":"Silva","id":"38242958800"},{"name":"Elcio Hideiti Shiguemori","affiliation":["Instituto de Estudos Avan\u00e7ados, Sao Paulo, Brazil","S\u00e3o Jos\u00e9 dos Campos, Instituto de Estudos Avan\u00e7ados - IEAv, SP, Brasil"],"firstName":"Elcio Hideiti","lastName":"Shiguemori","id":"37330094600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4978-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-3813-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1530-1834"},{"format":"CD","value":"1550-1834"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2377-5416"}],"articleNumber":"5395223","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":141},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image restoration","Artificial neural networks","Degradation","Neural networks","Optical noise","Testing","Signal restoration","Military computing","Inference algorithms","Fuzzy logic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["filtering theory","image restoration","inverse problems","mean square error methods","neural nets","pattern clustering","performance index"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["artificial neural network","image restoration","inverse process","clustering technique","suboptimal solution","knowledge estimation","degradation phenomenon","ANN based filters","mean squared error","signal-to-noise ratio","performance index"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Image Processings","Image Restoration","Neural Networks","Multiscale approaches"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5395223","abstract":"This paper presents a new approach to image restoration based on ANN, considering the learning of the inverse process using a standard image for training under a multiscale approach. Different models of ANN were tested and compared with the traditional techniques. The standard image was artificially degraded to simulate some types of frequent degradation problems. Due to the huge amount of data generated for training the ANN, this paper uses clustering techniques to reduce the training set. The paper proposes a simple restoration method that leads to a sub-optimal solution without the need of prior knowledge estimation of the degradation phenomenon. The ANN based filters were tested with different kinds of degraded images. The mean squared error and the signal-to-noise ratio were used as performance indices to measure the quality of the results of the ANN and of some of the existing methods for comparison. The results show that the ANN based restoration algorithms as proposed in this paper are effective restoration methods. The main advantage of the proposed approach is related to the fact that it does not require an estimation of prior knowledge of the degradation causes for each image.","doi":"10.1109/SIBGRAPI.2009.44","pdfPath":"/iel5/5394479/5395157/05395223.pdf","startPage":"172","endPage":"179","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 XXII Brazilian Symposium on Computer Graphics and Image Processing","publicationTitle":"2009 XXII Brazilian Symposium on Computer Graphics and Image Processing","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SIBGRAPI.2009.44","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5395157","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Image Restoration with Operators Modeled by Artificial Neural Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5395223/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-15 Oct. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Image Restoration with Operators Modeled by Artificial Neural Networks","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"22 January 2010","accessionNumber":"11134025","publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5395223/","conferenceDate":"11-15 Oct. 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Image Restoration with Operators Modeled by Artificial Neural Networks","confLoc":"Rio de Janeiro, Brazil","sourcePdf":"3813a172.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067497S","chronDate":"11-15 Oct. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5394479","isNumber":"5395157","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5394479","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5395157","articleId":"5395223","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5395305,"authors":[{"name":"Yu Li","affiliation":["Sino-Germen Joint Software Institute, Beihang University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yu","lastName":"Li","id":"38107053400"},{"name":"Yi Liu","affiliation":["Sino-Germen Joint Software Institute, Beihang University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yi","lastName":"Liu","id":"37292040700"},{"name":"Depei Qian","affiliation":["Sino-Germen Joint Software Institute, Beihang University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Depei","lastName":"Qian","id":"37289498500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5789-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5788-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-3900-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1521-9097"},{"format":"CD","value":"1521-9097"}],"articleNumber":"5395305","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":23,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":352},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5395305","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Scheduling algorithm","Clustering algorithms","Energy consumption","Large-scale systems","Processor scheduling","Mathematical model","Supercomputers","High performance computing","Application software","Algorithm design and analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["parallel machines","power aware computing","power consumption","scheduling","workstation clusters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["heuristic energy-aware scheduling","heterogeneous clusters","supercomputer","power consumption","large scale computer system","high performance computer","large scale clusters","energy saving","energy-aware task scheduling","adaptive scheduling heuristics","min-min algorithm"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICPADS.2009.33","endPage":"413","startPage":"407","publicationTitle":"2009 15th International Conference on Parallel and Distributed Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 15th International Conference on Parallel and Distributed Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5394475/5394991/05395305.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICPADS.2009.33","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5394991","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Heuristic Energy-aware Scheduling Algorithm for Heterogeneous Clusters","abstract":"With the rapid development of supercomputers, the power consumption by large scale computer systems has become a big concern.

Though MIMO (Multi-Input Multi-Output) technology can alleviate this effect greatly, it will result in higher transmission energy depletion as using more transmit antennas. Lots of schemes have been proposed to reduce such energy cost by transmit antenna selection. However, most of those only consider QoS requirements between neighbor nodes while ignoring QoS requirements for entire network. In this paper, we investigate an energy-efficient transmit antenna selection problem for many-to-one communications, while guaranteeing a certain packet drop loss ratio from any node to the sink. We prove that this problem (Transmit Antenna Selection Problem, TASP) is NP-hard. Thus, a greedy algorithm TASA (Transmit Antenna Selection Algorithm) is proposed to solve this problem. This paper also prove the correctness of the proposed algorithm and the time complexity of TASA algorithm is O(|E|+|V|-M\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">T</sub>\n), where |V| represents the number of nodes, |E| indicates the number of links and M\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">T</sub>\n is the number of transmit antennas on each node, respectively.

Equalized symbol power transmissions for uncompanded and mu-Law companded WiMax scenarios employing mu = 0.1, 1, 3, 10, 30, 100, 255, 1000, and 3000 has been undertaken.

The maximum improvement in SNR at the 0.001 BER probability level is ~1.7 dB, whilst at the 0.0001 BER probability level the improvement is ~2.9 dB. As companded BER rates for smaller values of mu are only slightly degraded over normal WiMax BER rates, then TBCC for small values of mu may be used to provide improved SNR performance over normal convolutional coding (CC) WiMax situations. Importantly, small values of mu can also provide improved Peak-to-Average Power Ratio (PAPR) but for larger values of mu, where significant PAPR reduction can be obtained, the improved performance of TBCC does not provide sufficient SNR gain to improve upon the standard CC WiMax performance.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"BER Performance Evaluation of Tail-Biting Convolution Coding Applied to Companded QPSK Mobile WiMax","publicationTitle":"2009 15th International Conference on Parallel and Distributed Systems","doi":"10.1109/ICPADS.2009.95","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 15th International Conference on Parallel and Distributed Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5394475/5394991/05395371.pdf","startPage":"734","endPage":"739","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICPADS.2009.95","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5394991","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5395371","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5395371/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 Dec. 2009","displayDocTitle":"BER Performance Evaluation of Tail-Biting Convolution Coding Applied to Companded QPSK Mobile WiMax","conferenceDate":"8-11 Dec. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5395371/","dateOfInsertion":"22 January 2010","publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","accessionNumber":"11104769","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"BER Performance Evaluation of Tail-Biting Convolution Coding Applied to Companded QPSK Mobile WiMax","confLoc":"Shenzhen, China","sourcePdf":"3900a734.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052519S","chronDate":"8-11 Dec. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5394475","isNumber":"5394991","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5394475","xplore-issue":"5394991","articleId":"5395371","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5395372,"authors":[{"name":"Yi Wen Wong","affiliation":["School of Computer Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"firstName":"Yi Wen","lastName":"Wong","id":"38255581300"},{"name":"Rick Siow Mong Goh","affiliation":["School of Computer Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"firstName":"Rick Siow Mong","lastName":"Goh","id":"37679428400"},{"name":"Shyh-Hao Kuo","affiliation":["School of Computer Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"firstName":"Shyh-Hao","lastName":"Kuo","id":"37672464200"},{"name":"Malcolm Yoke Hean Low","affiliation":["School of Computer Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"firstName":"Malcolm Yoke Hean","lastName":"Low","id":"37271777900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5789-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5788-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-3900-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1521-9097"},{"format":"CD","value":"1521-9097"}],"articleNumber":"5395372","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":10,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":157},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Tabu Search for the Heterogeneous DAG Scheduling Problem","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Processor scheduling","Optimal scheduling","High performance computing","Concurrent computing","Scheduling algorithm","Distributed computing","Computer architecture","Shape","Multicore processing","Field programmable gate arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["directed graphs","parallel processing","scheduling","search problems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["tabu search","heterogeneous DAG scheduling problem","list scheduling","task graph","HEFT","directed acyclic graphs"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["scheduling","heterogeneous","tabu search","metaheuristic","directed acyclic graphs","DAG"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5395372","abstract":"Scheduling parallel applications on heterogeneous processors/architectures with different computational speed is a difficult problem.

The effectiveness is evaluated based on a set of modified random benchmark graphs, including task graphs of real-world applications. Factors affecting algorithm performance are also examined.

The OC relays are the major protection devices in a distribution system. OC relay is usually employed as backup protection. But in some situations it may be the only protection provided. To reduce the power outages, maloperation of the backup relays should be avoided, and therefore, OC relay coordination in power distribution network is a major concern of protection engineer. The OC relay coordination in ring fed distribution networks is a highly constrained optimization problem.

Apart from physical construction of an array, the CCAA design may be classified into two major categories: uniformly excited arrays and non-uniformly excited arrays. The present paper assumes non-uniform excitation and a design problem of maximizing sidelobe level reduction. So, the design problem is modeled as an optimization problem and subsequently solved using three different evolutionary optimization techniques, BGA, PSOCFIWA and CRPSO. Each technique helps to determine an optimal set of normalized excitation weights for CCAA elements, which, when incorporated, results in a radiation pattern with maximum sidelobe level reduction. Among all the designs, the three-ring structure containing (N\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1</sub>\n = 4, N\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sub>\n= 6, N\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">3</sub>\n = 8) elements proves to be the optimal design owing to the highest SLL reduction achieved by each technique. However, while comparing the optimization efficiencies among the three techniques the newly proposed CRPSO technique yields the best optimum sets of normalized excitation weights with least \"Misfitness\" objective function values and maximum achievable SLL reductions for all sets of three-ring CCAA designs. CRPSO yields grand maximum SLL reduction (-14.94 dB) for the above optimal set. Further, a reduction of major lobe beamwidth is also observed when compared to a uniformly excited CCAA having equal number of elements and same radii.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-18 Dec. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5395462/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11104748","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5395462/","publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"22 January 2010","conferenceDate":"16-18 Dec. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Comparative Optimal Designs of Non-Uniformly Excited Concentric Circular Antenna Array Using Evolutionary Optimization Techniques","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Comparative Optimal Designs of Non-Uniformly Excited Concentric Circular Antenna Array Using Evolutionary Optimization Techniques","confLoc":"Nagpur, India","sourcePdf":"pid978918.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051511S","chronDate":"16-18 Dec. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5394476","isNumber":"5394994","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5394476","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"5394994","articleId":"5395462","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5395468,"authors":[{"name":"Tribeni Prasad Banerjee","affiliation":["Central Mechanical Engineering Research Institute, Durgapur, West Bengal, India"],"firstName":"Tribeni Prasad","lastName":"Banerjee","id":"37995425600"},{"name":"Amit Konar","affiliation":["Department of Electronics & Tele communication Engineering, Jadavpur University, Kolkata, India"],"firstName":"Amit","lastName":"Konar","id":"37299656200"},{"name":"Joydeb Roy Chowdhury","affiliation":["Central Mechanical Engineering Research Institute, Durgapur, West Bengal, India"],"firstName":"Joydeb Roy","lastName":"Chowdhury","id":"38109716800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5250-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-3884-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2157-0477"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2157-0485"}],"articleNumber":"5395468","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":210},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High-Speed Communication System Development Using FPGA Based CAM Implementation","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Second International Conference on Emerging Trends in Engineering & Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/5394476/5394994/05395468.pdf","startPage":"352","endPage":"357","publicationTitle":"2009 Second International Conference on Emerging Trends in Engineering & Technology","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICETET.2009.115","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5394994","doi":"10.1109/ICETET.2009.115","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Field programmable gate arrays","Computer aided manufacturing","CADCAM","Image coding","Throughput","Data compression","Data communication","Pixel","Hyperspectral imaging","Dictionaries"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["content-addressable storage","data communication","data compression","field programmable gate arrays","image resolution","video coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["high-speed communication system development","lossless data compressor","high level throughput","programmable FPGA technology","real time data compression","Xilinx Spartan3 -II FPGA","real-time data processing","CAM implementation","content addressable memory"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5395468","abstract":"In this paper we propose a lossless data compressor in high level throughput using re programmable FPGA technology.

However, many techniques available presently require a good deal of expertise to apply them successfully. Simpler approaches are needed which allow relatively unskilled operators to make reliable decisions without a diagnosis specialist to examine data and diagnose problems. In this paper simple, reliable and economical Neural Network (NN) based fault classifier is proposed, in which stator current is used as input signal from motor. Thirteen statistical parameters are extracted from the stator current and PCA is used to select proper input. Data is generated from the experimentation on specially designed 2 Hp, 4 pole 50 Hz. three phase induction motor. For classification, NNs like MLP, SVM and statistical classifiers based on CART and Discriminant Analysis are verified. Robustness of classifier to noise is also verified on unseen data by introducing controlled Gaussian and Uniform noise in input and output.","doi":"10.1109/ICETET.2009.100","pdfPath":"/iel5/5394476/5394994/05395476.pdf","startPage":"922","endPage":"928","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Second International Conference on Emerging Trends in Engineering & Technology","publicationTitle":"2009 Second International Conference on Emerging Trends in Engineering & Technology","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICETET.2009.100","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5394994","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fault Diagnosis of Three Phase Induction Motor Using Neural Network Techniques","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5395476/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-18 Dec. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Fault Diagnosis of Three Phase Induction Motor Using Neural Network Techniques","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"22 January 2010","accessionNumber":"11088663","publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5395476/","conferenceDate":"16-18 Dec. 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fault Diagnosis of Three Phase Induction Motor Using Neural Network Techniques","confLoc":"Nagpur, India","sourcePdf":"pid977626.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.087269S","chronDate":"16-18 Dec. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5394476","isNumber":"5394994","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5394476","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"5394994","articleId":"5395476","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5395480,"authors":[{"name":"Mamata V.

The conventional histogram method is modified to adopt for automatically determining the threshold for different regions in the image.

So, for real time signal processing applications, high throughput multiplier -accumulator (MAC) is always a key element to achieve a high-performance digital signal processing application. In the last few years, the main consideration of MAC design is to enhance its speed. This is because speed and throughput rate are always the concerns of digital signal processing systems. However due to the increase of portable electronic products, low power designs also become another major consideration. This is because, the limited battery energy of these portable products restricts the power consumption of the system. Therefore the main motivation is to investigate various pipelined MAC architectures and circuit and the design techniques which are suitable for the implementation of high through put signal processing algorithms. The goal of this project was to design and VLSI implementation of pipelined MAC for high-speed DSP applications at 180nm technology. For designing the pipelined MAC, various architectures of multipliers and one bit full adders are considered. The static and dynamic one bit full adder was implemented as the basic block. For checking the functionality of the whole system, spice code is written using the HSPICE by defining all the blocks in the circuit as the sub circuits. Then a schematic capture is done using schematic composer from virtuoso starting from bottom level to top level.

This paper presents a novel concept of integrating the Taguchi robust design principle with particle swarm optimization (PSO) for the PSS design. The objective is to build an intrinsic robustness in the design of PSS over a wide range of power system operating conditions. The proposed approach employs signal to noise ratio and orthogonal array concepts of Taguchi design to determine the robust optimal setting of PSS parameters using PSO. The robustness of the PSS designed is tested through No-Way analysis of variance. Further, the effectiveness of the robust PSS is illustrated through time-domain simulations as it is applied to a single machine infinite bus system under wide range of loading conditions.","doi":"10.1109/ICETET.2009.195","startPage":"515","endPage":"520","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Second International Conference on Emerging Trends in Engineering & Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/5394476/5394994/05395512.pdf","publicationTitle":"2009 Second International Conference on Emerging Trends in Engineering & Technology","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICETET.2009.195","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5394994","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robust Design of Power System Stabilizer Using Taguchi Technique and Particle Swarm Optimization","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power systems","Particle swarm optimization","Noise robustness","Power system stability","Design engineering","Power engineering and energy","Power system analysis computing","Power system simulation","Damping","Power system dynamics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["particle swarm optimisation","power system stability","time-domain analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power system stabilizer","particle swarm optimization","Taguchi robust design principle","no-way analysis","time-domain simulations","single machine infinite bus system"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5395512/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-18 Dec. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Robust Design of Power System Stabilizer Using Taguchi Technique and Particle Swarm Optimization","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5395512/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"22 January 2010","conferenceDate":"16-18 Dec. 2009","accessionNumber":"11088678","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust Design of Power System Stabilizer Using Taguchi Technique and Particle Swarm Optimization","confLoc":"Nagpur, India","sourcePdf":"pid973807.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060163S","chronDate":"16-18 Dec. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5394476","isNumber":"5394994","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5394476","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5394994","articleId":"5395512","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5395513,"authors":[{"name":"Sanjeev Kumar","affiliation":["Department of Maths & Computer Science, University of Udine, Udine, Italy"],"firstName":"Sanjeev","lastName":"Kumar","id":"38658525700"},{"name":"Balasubramanian Raman","affiliation":["Department of Mathematics, Indian Institute of Technology Roorkee, Roorkee, India"],"firstName":"Balasubramanian","lastName":"Raman","id":"37295634200"},{"name":"Jonathan Wu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Eng, University of Windsor, Windsor, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Jonathan","lastName":"Wu","id":"37404814700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5250-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-3884-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2157-0477"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2157-0485"}],"articleNumber":"5395513","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":185},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cameras","Particle swarm optimization","Calibration","Neural networks","Robot vision systems","Genetic algorithms","Artificial neural networks","Backpropagation algorithms","Feedforward neural networks","Image reconstruction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["calibration","cameras","feedforward neural nets","parameter estimation","particle swarm optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["camera neurocalibration","particle swarm optimization","PSO","feedforward neural network","calibration parameter estimation","pinhole camera"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5395513","abstract":"In this paper, a particle swarm optimization (PSO) based camera calibration approach is presented to determine the external and internal calibration parameters from the knowledge of a given set of points in object space.

However, until recently, efficient application at the low sub-milliwatt power levels has not been realized due to limitations in available control circuitry. This paper presents a \u201csmart\u201d microcontroller-based power management system with online power stage efficiency optimization and maximum power point tracking (MPPT). The system is experimentally evaluated using a new, more accurate four-quadrant rectenna model and circuit realization that enables rigorous testing of the power management system for a wide range of rectenna arrays and power characteristics. Hardware results are presented with online optimization over a converter input power range from 10 \u03bcW to 1 mW. Results are also shown based on the application of harvesting RF power from a nearby cellular tower, where the power management system collects up to seven times more energy when compared to a direct battery connection.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","pdfPath":"/iel5/8919/5512812/05395599.pdf","startPage":"1802","endPage":"1811","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","doi":"10.1109/TCSI.2009.2034891","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSI.2009.2034891","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5512812","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5395599","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Power Management System for Online Low Power RF Energy Harvesting Optimization","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Energy management","Power system management","Radio frequency","Sensor arrays","Wireless sensor networks","Rectennas","Circuit testing","Power transmission","Space power stations","Satellites"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","energy harvesting","low-power electronics","microcontrollers","power system management","power transmission","rectennas","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["online low power RF energy harvesting optimization","wireless RF power transmission","power delivery","high-power space solar power satellites","low-power wireless sensors","low sub-milliwatt power levels","control circuitry","smart microcontroller-based power management system","online power stage efficiency optimization","maximum power point tracking","MPPT","four-quadrant rectenna model","circuit realization","rectenna arrays","cellular tower","direct battery connection"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["DCM resistor emulation","maximum power point tracking","MPPT","power management","rectenna","SMPS boost","wireless power"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5395599/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 January 2010","displayDocTitle":"Power Management System for Online Low Power RF Energy Harvesting Optimization","volume":"57","issue":"7","htmlLink":"/document/5395599/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2010","accessionNumber":"11416854","dateOfInsertion":"19 July 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Power Management System for Online Low Power RF Energy Harvesting Optimization","sourcePdf":"tcsi-dolgov-2034891-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.066677S","chronDate":"July  2010","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"5512812","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"148","xplore-issue":"5512812","articleId":"5395599","onlineDate":"22 January 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5395601,"authors":[{"name":"Hamed Gheidi","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Iran"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/22/5409964/5395601/5395601-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Hamed Gheidi (S'08) was born in Tehran, Iran, in 1979.

In the proposed method, the phase shifter is omitted. In contrast, a 90\u00b0 hybrid with one more channel containing a phase detector, and a low-noise amplifier is added to the measurement setup. It can be said that an in-phase/quadrature phase-noise detection has been developed. With the proposed method, tuning of the variable phase shifter is not needed anymore. Therefore, the measurement is done automatically, and as a result, the measurement time is decreased. Another considerable advantage of this method is that the method is theoretically self-calibrated. For verifying the accuracy of the method, a measurement setup based on the proposed method was established. Two relatively low phase-noise phase-locked oscillators at frequencies of 2.8 and 4.9 GHz were designed. Their phase noise was measured by the proposed method, the conventional delay-line method, and the two-oscillator technique. Comparison of the measured data of the three methods shows the validity of the proposed method.","doi":"10.1109/TMTT.2009.2038452","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel5/22/5409964/05395601.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5409964","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMTT.2009.2038452","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","startPage":"468","endPage":"477","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Phase-Noise Measurement of Microwave Oscillators Using Phase-Shifterless Delay-Line Discriminator","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5395601","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 January 2010","displayDocTitle":"Phase-Noise Measurement of Microwave Oscillators Using Phase-Shifterless Delay-Line Discriminator","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5395601/","volume":"58","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/5395601/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2010","accessionNumber":"11105682","dateOfInsertion":"08 February 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Phase-Noise Measurement of Microwave Oscillators Using Phase-Shifterless Delay-Line Discriminator","sourcePdf":"58tmtt02-abanai-2038452.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.088672S","chronDate":"Feb.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"22","isNumber":"5409964","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"5409964","articleId":"5395601","onlineDate":"22 January 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5395603,"authors":[{"name":"H.

To this aim, simplified large-signal and small-signal models of MOS transistors in subthreshold region are first developed. After replacing transistors with these equivalent models, analysis of the main DC parameters of CMOS logic gates is presented. In particular, the change in the DC characteristics shape due to operation at ultra-low voltages is analyzed in detail, evaluating analytically the degradation in the logic swing, the symmetry and the steepness of the transition region, as well as the change in the unity-gain points position. The resulting expressions permit to gain an insight into the basic dependence of DC behavior on design and device parameters. The noise margin is explicitly evaluated and modeled with a very simple expression. Interestingly, analysis shows that the noise margin deviates from the ideal half-swing value by an amount that linearly depends on the logarithm of the \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">pn</i>\n -ratio. Analysis permits to evaluate the minimum supply voltage that ensures correct operation of CMOS logic (i.e., positive noise margin). Previously proposed rule of thumbs to evaluate minimum voltage are also theoretically justified. Moreover, the impact of pMOS/nMOS unbalancing on DC characteristics is analyzed from a design perspective. Considerations on the impact of process/voltage/temperature variations are also introduced. Results are validated through extensive simulations in a 65-nm CMOS technology.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5395622/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 January 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2010","volume":"57","issue":"7","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11416857","dateOfInsertion":"19 July 2010","publicationDate":"July 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5395622/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Understanding DC Behavior of Subthreshold CMOS Logic Through Closed-Form Analysis","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Understanding DC Behavior of Subthreshold CMOS Logic Through Closed-Form Analysis","sourcePdf":"tcsi-alioto-2034233-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.081083S","chronDate":"July  2010","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"5512812","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"123","xplore-issue":"5512812","articleId":"5395622","onlineDate":"22 January 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-22"},{"_id":5395629,"authors":[{"name":"George C.

Analytical expressions for the distribution of the SED output signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) are obtained for the constant correlation model. For the most general case of arbitrary correlation, by assuming half-integer or integer values for the fading parameter m, analytical expressions for the distribution of the output SNR with L \u00bf 3 are derived. Moreover, for L > 3, analytical approximations for the output SNR are presented. The derived expressions are used to study the outage and average symbol error probability of SED receivers. Performance results obtained by numerical evaluation and verified by means of computer simulations show that the performance of the receivers under consideration is degraded with increasing branch correlation. Nevertheless, SED receivers outperform uncorrelated switch-and-stay diversity receivers, even when they operate under high branch correlation.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Switch-and-Examine Diversity Over Arbitrarily Correlated Nakagami- - Fading Channels","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2010.2041016","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/5463253/05395629.pdf","startPage":"2080","endPage":"2087","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2010.2041016","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5463253","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5395629","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5395629/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 January 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2010","displayDocTitle":"Switch-and-Examine Diversity Over Arbitrarily Correlated Nakagami- <formula formulatype=\"inline\"><tex Notation=\"TeX\">$m$</tex></formula> Fading Channels","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"59","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/5395629/","dateOfInsertion":"27 May 2010","publicationDate":"May 2010","accessionNumber":"11285970","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Switch-and-Examine Diversity Over Arbitrarily Correlated Nakagami- <formula formulatype=\"inline\"><tex Notation=\"TeX\">$m$</tex></formula> Fading Channels","sourcePdf":"tvt-mathiopoulos-2041016.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.0998S","chronDate":"May  2010","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"5463253","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"27","xplore-issue":"5463253","articleId":"5395629","onlineDate":"22 January 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5395631,"authors":[{"name":"Xuebin Wu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Lehigh University, Bethlehem, PA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/92/5735629/5395631/5395631-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Xuebin Wu received the B.E. and M.Eng. degrees in electrical engineering from Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, in 2004 and 2007, respectively.

Using this framework, we then propose novel CODEC designs for three important classes of CACs, one lambda codes (OLCs), FPCs, and forbidden overlapping codes (FOCs). Our CODEC designs have area complexity and delay that increase quadratically with the size of the bus, while achieving optimal or nearly optimal code rates. Our CODECs also have simple and regular circuitry, and can easily achieve very high throughput by pipelining. Our efficient CODECs, used with such techniques as partial coding, help to make CACs a practical option in combating crosstalk delay, which is a bottleneck in deep submicrometer system-on-chip designs.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient CODEC Designs for Crosstalk Avoidance Codes Based on Numeral Systems","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","doi":"10.1109/TVLSI.2009.2038389","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/92/5735629/05395631.pdf","startPage":"548","endPage":"558","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVLSI.2009.2038389","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5735629","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5395631","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5395631/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 January 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2011","displayDocTitle":"Efficient CODEC Designs for Crosstalk Avoidance Codes Based on Numeral Systems","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"19","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/5395631/","dateOfInsertion":"22 March 2011","publicationDate":"April 2011","accessionNumber":"11883070","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient CODEC Designs for Crosstalk Avoidance Codes Based on Numeral Systems","sourcePdf":"tvlsi-zyan-2038389-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.084103S","chronDate":"April  2011","xplore-pub-id":"92","isNumber":"5735629","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"26","xplore-issue":"5735629","articleId":"5395631","onlineDate":"22 January 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5395633,"authors":[{"name":"Anita Kumari","affiliation":["Nano Computing Research Group NCRG, Department of Electrical Engineering, University of South Florida, Tampa, FL, USA"],"firstName":"Anita","lastName":"Kumari","id":"37331341100"},{"name":"Sanjukta Bhanja","affiliation":["Nano Computing Research Group NCRG, Department of Electrical Engineering, University of South Florida, Tampa, FL, USA"],"firstName":"Sanjukta","lastName":"Bhanja","id":"37267220500"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-8210"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9999"}],"articleNumber":"5395633","dbTime":"20 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":17,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":487},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Circuits and Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieee-cas.org/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computer Society","url":"http://www.computer.org/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Solid-State Circuits Society","url":"http://www.sscs.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Clocks","Magnetic anisotropy","Perpendicular magnetic anisotropy","Quantum cellular automata","Logic arrays","Shape","Object oriented modeling","Couplings","Magnetostatics","Magnetic materials"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular arrays","cellular automata","clocks","nanomagnetics","semiconductor quantum dots"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["magnetic cellular automata array","quantum-dot-cellular automata","single-domain nanomagnet process","mutual interaction","Landauer clocking scheme","logic signal propagation","temperature 293 K to 298 K"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Clock","magnetic cellular automata (MCA)","quantum-dot-cellular automata (QCA)"]}],"abstract":"Magnetic cellular automata (MCA) is a variant of quantum-dot-cellular automata (QCA) where neighboring single-domain nanomagnets (also termed as magnetic cell) process and propagate information (logic 1 or logic 0) through mutual interaction.

As voice traffic is sensitive to delay, the presence of primary users and the requirement that secondary users should not interfere with them pose many challenges for QoS support in cognitive radio networks. Two cognitive medium-access control (MAC) schemes are proposed in this paper for secondary voice users to access the available channel. One is the contention-based scheme, and the other is the contention-free scheme. An analytical model is developed to obtain the voice-service capacity (i.e., the maximum number of secondary voice users that can be supported with QoS guarantee) of the two proposed schemes, taking into account the impact of the primary users' activity. Both independent and correlated channel busy/idle state models for primary activity are considered. The analytical model is validated by simulations.

Multiple CFOs cause severe phase distortion in the equalized data for large block lengths and/or constellation sizes, thus yielding poor detection performance. Instead of explicitly estimating the CFOs and then compensating them, the proposed scheme estimates the rotated phases (not frequencies) caused by multiple unknown CFOs and then removes the phase rotations from the equalized data before symbol detection. The estimation accuracy of the phase rotation is improved by utilizing a groupwise method rather than symbol-by-symbol methods. This paper differs from other related work in orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) studies in that it can combat multiple CFOs that are time varying within each block. Numerical examples for 4 \u00d7 2 and 8 \u00d7 4 single-carrier systems with quaternary phase-shift keying (QPSK) and eight-phase-shift keying (8PSK) modulation illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme in terms of scatter plots of constellation, mean square error (MSE), and bit error rate (BER).","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Channel Equalization and Symbol Detection for Single-Carrier MIMO Systems in the Presence of Multiple Carrier Frequency Offsets","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2010.2041259","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/5463253/05395650.pdf","startPage":"2021","endPage":"2030","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2010.2041259","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5463253","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5395650","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5395650/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 January 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2010","displayDocTitle":"Channel Equalization and Symbol Detection for Single-Carrier MIMO Systems in the Presence of Multiple Carrier Frequency Offsets","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"59","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/5395650/","dateOfInsertion":"27 May 2010","publicationDate":"May 2010","accessionNumber":"11285993","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Channel Equalization and Symbol Detection for Single-Carrier MIMO Systems in the Presence of Multiple Carrier Frequency Offsets","sourcePdf":"tvt-xiao-2041259.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.089042S","chronDate":"May  2010","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"5463253","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"5463253","articleId":"5395650","onlineDate":"22 January 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5395653,"authors":[{"name":"Xiao-Ke Xu","affiliation":["School of Communication and Electronics Engineering, Qingdao Technological University, Qingdao, China"],"firstName":"Xiao-Ke","lastName":"Xu","id":"37673334900"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-926X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2221"}],"articleNumber":"5395653","dbTime":"27 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":29,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":723},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society","url":"http://www.ieeeaps.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Object detection","Fractals","Clutter","Doped fiber amplifiers","Statistics","Fluctuations","Radar detection","Sea surface","Geometry","Spatial databases"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fractals","radar clutter","radar detection","statistical analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["targets detection","joint fractal property","sea clutter","IPIX OHGR datasets","detrended fluctuation analysis","fractal statistics","Hurst exponent","fractal difference","optimal multiscales","real-life IPIX radar datasets","joint fractal detection"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA)","fractal","Hurst exponent","sea clutter","target detection"]}],"abstract":"We exploit the joint fractal properties of sea clutter extracted from detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA) for targets detection.

The compactness of the EM-EBG is investigated and shown to be superior to that of the CM-EBG in practical cases. The superior reduction of mutual coupling of the EM-EBG is demonstrated by full-wave and experimental results both for a pair of patches and for a 4-element patch array. Finally, the benefits of the EM-EBG in terms of array processing, specifically side-lobe level (SLL) control and direction of arrival (DOA) estimation, are presented.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel5/8/5443538/05395661.pdf","startPage":"1076","endPage":"1086","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","doi":"10.1109/TAP.2010.2041152","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.2010.2041152","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5443538","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5395661","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Compact Elongated Mushroom (EM)-EBG Structure for Enhancement of Patch Antenna Array Performances","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Patch antennas","Antenna arrays","Periodic structures","Metamaterials","Mutual coupling","Direction of arrival estimation","Microstrip antenna arrays","Array signal processing","Frequency","Guidelines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["direction-of-arrival estimation","microstrip antenna arrays","photonic band gap"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["patch antenna array performance","compact elongated mushroom electromagnetic band gap structure","array processing","sidelobe level control","direction of arrival estimation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Antennas arrays","array processing","direction of arrival (DOA)","electromagnetic band-gap (EBG) structures","microstrip patch antennas","mutual coupling","side-lobe level (SLL)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5395661/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 January 2010","displayDocTitle":"Compact Elongated Mushroom (EM)-EBG Structure for Enhancement of Patch Antenna Array Performances","volume":"58","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/5395661/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2010","accessionNumber":"11208246","dateOfInsertion":"05 April 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Compact Elongated Mushroom (EM)-EBG Structure for Enhancement of Patch Antenna Array Performances","sourcePdf":"tap-coulombe-2041152.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.080115S","chronDate":"April  2010","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"5443538","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"70","xplore-issue":"5443538","articleId":"5395661","onlineDate":"22 January 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5395663,"authors":[{"name":"Wei Xu","affiliation":["Technology Innovation Institute, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Xu","id":"37536683500"},{"name":"Jianhua Zhang","affiliation":["Key Lab of Universal Wireless Communications, Ministry of Education, China"],"firstName":"Jianhua","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37293674400"},{"name":"Yi Liu","affiliation":["Technology Innovation Institute, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yi","lastName":"Liu","id":"37675740100"},{"name":"Ping Zhang","affiliation":["Key Lab of Universal Wireless Communications, Ministry of Education, China"],"firstName":"Ping","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37274503400"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1070-9908"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2361"}],"articleNumber":"5395663","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":382},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.signalprocessingsociety.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Frequency estimation","Equations","Timing","Frequency synchronization","Technological innovation","Wireless communication","Fading"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Monte Carlo methods","OFDM modulation","synchronisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["blind OFDM synchronization","Monte Carlo simulation","offset estimator","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Blind synchronization","frequency offset estimator","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5395663","abstract":"This comment points out several errors in the above letter.

The simulator models the networks as homogeneous MTLs that are excited by external fields and driven/terminated/connected by potentially nonlinear lumped circuitry. It hybridizes an MTL solver derived from time-domain integral equations (TDIEs) in unknown wave coefficients for each MTL with a circuit solver rooted in modified nodal analysis equations in unknown node voltages and voltage-source currents for each circuit. These two solvers are rigorously interfaced at MTL and circuit terminals, and the resulting coupled system of equations is solved simultaneously for all MTL and circuit unknowns at each time step.

In this paper, analytical models for the critical charge variations accounting for both die-to-die and within-die variations are proposed. The derived models are verified and compared to Monte Carlo simulations by using industrial 65-nm CMOS technology. This paper provides new design insights such as the impact of the coupling capacitor, one of the most common soft error mitigation techniques, on the critical charge variability, especially, at lower supply voltages. It demonstrates that two extreme values of this coupling capacitor exist. The first value results in maximum relative variations and the other results in minimum relative variations. Therefore, the circuit designers can utilize these results to design the coupling capacitor to limit the variations under power and performance constraints in early design cycles. The derived analytical models account for the impact of the supply voltage and different particle strike conditions. These results are particularly important for soft error tolerant and variation tolerant designs in submicrometer technologies, especially, for low power operations.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 January 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5395690/","volume":"57","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/5395690/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11341204","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"June 2010","dateOfInsertion":"07 June 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A Design-Oriented Soft Error Rate Variation Model Accounting for Both Die-to-Die and Within-Die Variations in Submicrometer CMOS SRAM Cells","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Design-Oriented Soft Error Rate Variation Model Accounting for Both Die-to-Die and Within-Die Variations in Submicrometer CMOS SRAM Cells","sourcePdf":"57tcsi07-hmostafa-2033528.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.175823S","chronDate":"June  2010","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"5482395","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"5482395","articleId":"5395690","onlineDate":"22 January 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5395694,"authors":[{"name":"Ketan Kotwal","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology Bombay, Mumbai, India"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/36/5447593/5395694/5395694-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Ketan Kotwal received the B.E. degree in electronics and telecommunication from the University of Pune, Pune, India, in 2005.

A bilateral filtering-based approach is presented for hyperspectral image fusion to generate an appropriate resultant image. The proposed approach retains even the minor details that exist in individual image bands, by exploiting the edge-preserving characteristics of a bilateral filter. It does not introduce visible artifacts in the fused image. A hierarchical fusion scheme has also been proposed for implementation purposes to accommodate a large number of hyperspectral image bands. The proposed scheme provides computational and storage efficiency without affecting the quality and performance of the fusion. It also facilitates the midband visualization of a subset of the hyperspectral image cube. Quantitative performance results are presented to indicate the effectiveness of the proposed method.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5395694/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 January 2010","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11246725","volume":"48","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/5395694/","publicationDate":"May 2010","dateOfInsertion":"15 April 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Visualization of Hyperspectral Images Using Bilateral Filtering","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Visualization of Hyperspectral Images Using Bilateral Filtering","sourcePdf":"tgrs-kotwal-2037950.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.129744S","chronDate":"May  2010","xplore-pub-id":"36","isNumber":"5447593","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"69","xplore-issue":"5447593","articleId":"5395694","onlineDate":"22 January 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":5395700,"authors":[{"name":"A.

The process of joint relaxation and restriction is conducted iteratively to systematically improve solutions. Our algorithm is compared with a state-of-the-art previous work on benchmark circuits. The results from our algorithm can lead to about 22% less power dissipation subject to the same timing constraints.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/43/5395722/05395732.pdf","startPage":"223","endPage":"234","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","doi":"10.1109/TCAD.2009.2035575","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCAD.2009.2035575","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5395722","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5395732","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A New Algorithm for Simultaneous Gate Sizing and Threshold Voltage Assignment","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Threshold voltage","Timing","Iterative algorithms","Circuits","Optimization methods","Power dissipation","Dynamic programming","Linear programming","Table lookup","Delay estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["circuit optimisation","integrated circuit design","timing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["gate sizing","threshold voltage assignment","circuit timing","power optimization","sensitivity-driven heuristics"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Algorithms","circuit optimization"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5395732/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 January 2010","displayDocTitle":"A New Algorithm for Simultaneous Gate Sizing and Threshold Voltage Assignment","volume":"29","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/5395732/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2010","accessionNumber":"11133749","dateOfInsertion":"22 January 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A New Algorithm for Simultaneous Gate Sizing and Threshold Voltage Assignment","sourcePdf":"tcad-yliu-2035575.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.088386S","chronDate":"Feb.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"43","isNumber":"5395722","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","citationCount":"43","xplore-issue":"5395722","articleId":"5395732","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5395736,"authors":[{"name":"R.

Random mismatch is caused by process variation, while systematic mismatch is mainly due to an asymmetrical layout and processing gradients. A common centroid structure may be used to reduce systematic mismatch errors, but not random mismatch errors. Based on the spatial correlation model, this paper formulates the placement optimization problem of analog circuits using switched-capacitor techniques. A placement with higher correlation coefficients of the unit capacitors results in a higher acceptance rate, or chip yield. This paper proposes a heuristic algorithm that quickly and automatically derives the placement of the unit capacitors with the highest, or near-highest, correlation coefficients for yield improvement. Results show that the resultant placement derived from the proposed algorithm achieves better yield improvement than that from a common centroid approach. The proposed heuristic algorithm can be applied for any arbitrary capacitor ratios, i.e., more than two capacitors.","doi":"10.1109/TCAD.2009.2035587","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/43/5395722/05395737.pdf","startPage":"313","endPage":"318","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCAD.2009.2035587","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5395722","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Placement Optimization for Yield Improvement of Switched-Capacitor Analog Integrated Circuits","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 January 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5395737/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2010","displayDocTitle":"Placement Optimization for Yield Improvement of Switched-Capacitor Analog Integrated Circuits","dateOfInsertion":"22 January 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5395737/","accessionNumber":"11133751","volume":"29","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Feb. 2010","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Placement Optimization for Yield Improvement of Switched-Capacitor Analog Integrated Circuits","sourcePdf":"tcad-pluo-2035587.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.12361S","chronDate":"Feb.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"43","isNumber":"5395722","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","citationCount":"31","xplore-issue":"5395722","articleId":"5395737","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5395738,"authors":[{"name":"Qunzeng Liu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/43/5395722/5395738/5395738-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Qunzeng Liu received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering from Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China, in 2005.

These adaptation techniques are often based on measurements of a replica of the nominal critical path, whose variations are intended to reflect those of the entire circuit after manufacturing. For realistic circuits, where the number of critical paths can be large, the notion of using a single critical path is too simplistic. This paper overcomes this problem by introducing the idea of synthesizing a representative critical path (RCP), which captures these complexities of the variations. We first prove that the requirement on the RCP is that it should be highly correlated with the circuit delay. Next, we present three novel algorithms to automatically build the RCP. Our experimental results demonstrate that over a number of samples of manufactured circuits, the delay of the RCP captures the worst case delay of the manufactured circuit. The average prediction error of all circuits is shown to be below 2.8% for all three approaches. For both our approach and the critical path replica method, it is essential to guard-band the prediction to ensure pessimism: on average our approach requires a guard band 31% smaller than for the critical path replica method.","doi":"10.1109/TCAD.2009.2035552","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/43/5395722/05395738.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCAD.2009.2035552","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5395722","startPage":"211","endPage":"222","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Capturing Post-Silicon Variations Using a Representative Critical Path","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5395738","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Capturing Post-Silicon Variations Using a Representative Critical Path","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5395738/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 January 2010","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"29","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Feb. 2010","accessionNumber":"11133752","dateOfInsertion":"22 January 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5395738/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Capturing Post-Silicon Variations Using a Representative Critical Path","sourcePdf":"tcad-qliu-2035552.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.072085S","chronDate":"Feb.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"43","isNumber":"5395722","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"5395722","articleId":"5395738","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5395742,"authors":[{"name":"Kun Yuan","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Technology, Austin, TX, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/43/5395722/5395742/5395742-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Kun Yuan received the B.S. degree in electronic engineering and information science from the University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, China, in 2004.

In DPL, the layout patterns are decomposed into two masks (colors), and manufactured through two exposures and etch steps. If the spacing between two features (polygons) is less than certain minimum coloring distance, they have to be assigned opposite colors. However, a proper coloring is not always feasible because two neighboring patterns within the minimum distance may be in the same mask due to complex pattern configurations. In that case, a feature may need to be split into two parts to resolve the conflict, resulting in stitch insertion which causes yield loss due to overlay and line-end effect. While previous layout decomposition approaches perform coloring and splitting separately, in this paper, we propose a simultaneous conflict and stitch minimization algorithm with an integer linear programming (ILP) formulation. Since ILP is in class NP-hard, the algorithm includes three speed-up techniques: (1) grid merging; (2) independent component computation; and (3) layout partition. In addition, our algorithm can be extended to handle design rules such as overlap margin and minimum width for practical use as well as off-grid layout. Our approach can reduce 33% of stitches and remove conflicts by 87.6% compared with two phase greedy decomposition.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5395742/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 January 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2010","volume":"29","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"22 January 2010","publicationDate":"Feb. 2010","accessionNumber":"11074213","htmlLink":"/document/5395742/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Double Patterning Layout Decomposition for Simultaneous Conflict and Stitch Minimization","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Double Patterning Layout Decomposition for Simultaneous Conflict and Stitch Minimization","sourcePdf":"tcad-kyuan-2035577.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.071063S","chronDate":"Feb.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"43","isNumber":"5395722","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","citationCount":"54","xplore-issue":"5395722","articleId":"5395742","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5395747,"authors":[{"name":"Quang Dinh","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering and Coordinated Science Laboratory, University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, Urbana, IL, USA"],"firstName":"Quang","lastName":"Dinh","id":"37267294600"},{"name":"Deming Chen","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering and Coordinated Science Laboratory, University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, Urbana, IL, USA"],"firstName":"Deming","lastName":"Chen","id":"37274186500"},{"name":"Martin D.

This paper defines and explores near-threshold computing (NTC), a design space where the supply voltage is approximately equal to the threshold voltage of the transistors. This region retains much of the energy savings of subthreshold operation with more favorable performance and variability characteristics. This makes it applicable to a broad range of power-constrained computing segments from sensors to high performance servers. This paper explores the barriers to the widespread adoption of NTC and describes current work aimed at overcoming these obstacles.","doi":"10.1109/JPROC.2009.2034764","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel5/5/5395752/05395763.pdf","startPage":"253","endPage":"266","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5395752","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JPROC.2009.2034764","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Near-Threshold Computing: Reclaiming Moore's Law Through Energy Efficient Integrated Circuits","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5395763","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2010","displayDocTitle":"Near-Threshold Computing: Reclaiming Moore's Law Through Energy Efficient Integrated Circuits","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5395763/","publicationDate":"Feb. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"22 January 2010","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"11074178","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5395763/","volume":"98","issue":"2","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 January 2010","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Near-Threshold Computing: Reclaiming Moore's Law Through Energy Efficient Integrated Circuits","sourcePdf":"jproc-dreslinski-2034764.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.189948S","chronDate":"Feb.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"5","isNumber":"5395752","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"537","xplore-issue":"5395752","articleId":"5395763","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":5395764,"authors":[{"name":"Ryan D.

Next, we will examine the application of that clockless logic approach to a military system, reviewing the background of the experiment, factors considered in the comparison, and then summarizing the results of the comparisons.

While the trade-off between power and performance is well-recognized, most recent studies focus on the extreme ends of this balance. By concentrating instead on an intermediate range, an ~ 8\u00d7 improvement in power efficiency can be attained without system performance loss in parallelizable applications-those in which such efficiency is most critical. It is argued that power-efficient hardware is fundamentally limited by voltage scaling, which can be achieved only by blurring the boundaries between devices, circuits, and systems and cannot be realized by addressing any one area alone. By simultaneously considering all three perspectives, the major issues involved in improving power efficiency in light of performance and area constraints are identified. Solutions for the critical elements of a practical computing system are discussed, including the underlying logic device, associated cache memory, off-chip interconnect, and power delivery system. The IBM Blue Gene system is then presented as a case study to exemplify several proposed directions. Going forward, further power reduction may demand radical changes in device technologies and computer architecture; hence, a few such promising methods are briefly considered.","doi":"10.1109/JPROC.2009.2035451","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel5/5/5395752/05395765.pdf","startPage":"215","endPage":"236","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5395752","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JPROC.2009.2035451","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Practical Strategies for Power-Efficient Computing Technologies","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5395765","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2010","displayDocTitle":"Practical Strategies for Power-Efficient Computing Technologies","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5395765/","publicationDate":"Feb. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"22 January 2010","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"11087574","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5395765/","volume":"98","issue":"2","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 January 2010","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Practical Strategies for Power-Efficient Computing Technologies","sourcePdf":"jproc-chang-2035451.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.140911S","chronDate":"Feb.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"5","isNumber":"5395752","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"149","xplore-issue":"5395752","articleId":"5395765","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5395766,"authors":[{"name":"Narbeh Derhacobian","affiliation":["Adesto Technologies Corporation, Sunnyvale, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5/5395752/5395766/5395766-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Narbeh Derhacobian (Member, IEEE) received the B.S., M.S., and Ph.D. degrees in physics from University of California, Los Angeles.

In recent years, the proliferation of personal media devices such as multimedia-enabled cell phones, personal music players, and digital cameras has accelerated the adoption of silicon-based solid state storage cards in consumer markets. Despite the expanded use of nonvolatile memory technologies in a variety of integrated systems, little has changed with respect to the core technology and cells that hold the data when power has been turned off. Today, floating gate (FG) or oxide-nitride-oxide trapped charge (ONO) cell structures dominate as the core technology behind all NVM devices and embedded blocks. All of the nonvolatile memory devices in production today based on these technologies require high voltage in excess of 5-8 V to operate primarily due to the fundamental nature of core cells and the physics of charge storage mechanisms. These are huge overvoltage requirements considering that the transistors in the logic block require substantially lower voltages (e.g., sub-65 nm logic CMOS operate at less than 1 V). Integrating such high-voltage operation in advanced logic processes such as 65 nm or below logic CMOS process is yet another challenge limiting the exploitation of NVM for low-power embedded applications. The high voltage requirement for operation of these core cells has put strains on the continued scaling of today's discrete and embedded NVM technologies. Furthermore, future ultralow-power and subthreshold CMOS applications such as energy starved electronics require operations at sub-500 mV which clearly set forth significant challenges in integrating today's NVM technologies as nonvolatile storage elements for such systems. Several emerging technologies are competing to become the building blocks of next-generation nonvolatile memory solutions. Each of these emerging technologies has unique characteristics in terms of physical scaling, voltage scaling, cost, performance, and power features which differ from today's FG and ONO based technologies. This paper reviews the fundamental characteristics of current nonvolatile memory technologies as well as several promising emerging technologies from energy and power perspectives and specifically discusses the suitability of each one for use in ultralow-power and subthreshold CMOS applications.","doi":"10.1109/JPROC.2009.2035147","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel5/5/5395752/05395766.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JPROC.2009.2035147","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5395752","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","startPage":"283","endPage":"298","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 January 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Power and Energy Perspectives of Nonvolatile Memory Technologies","volume":"98","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/5395766/","dateOfInsertion":"22 January 2010","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"11074179","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5395766/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2010","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Power and Energy Perspectives of Nonvolatile Memory Technologies","sourcePdf":"jproc-derhacobian-2035147.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.11766S","chronDate":"Feb.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"5","isNumber":"5395752","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"61","xplore-issue":"5395752","articleId":"5395766","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5395767,"authors":[{"name":"Jos Akhtman","affiliation":["School of ECS, University of Southampton, Southampton, UK"],"firstName":"Jos","lastName":"Akhtman","id":"37298482900"},{"name":"Lajos Hanzo","affiliation":["School of ECS, University of Southampton, Southampton, UK"],"firstName":"Lajos","lastName":"Hanzo","id":"37276255400"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9219"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2256"}],"articleNumber":"5395767","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":13,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":797},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE","url":"http://www.ieee.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wireless communication","Network topology","Peer to peer computing","Mobile ad hoc networks","Ubiquitous computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ad hoc networks","cellular radio","local area networks","metropolitan area networks","personal area networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["heterogeneous wireless networking","ubiquitous wireless communication","personal area network","metropolitan area network","local area network","MAN","LAN","PAN","mobile ad hoc network","MANET","cellular network","telecommunications technology","cellular networks","societal constitution"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5395767","doi":"10.1109/JPROC.2009.2037213","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JPROC.2009.2037213","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5395752","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel5/5/5395752/05395767.pdf","startPage":"135","endPage":"138","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Heterogeneous Networking: An Enabling Paradigm for Ubiquitous Wireless Communications [Point of View]","abstract":"It is a widely accepted notion that the long-term aim of the technological progress in the field of wireless communications is constituted by the provision of ubiquitous connectivity between individuals, as well as a multiplicity of existing and future pervasive devices which increasingly permeate our environment. In this context the currently dominant cellular (a combination of metropolitan, local, and personal area networks-MANs, LANs, and PANs, respectively), as well as the emerging mobile ad hoc network (MANET) architectures constitute the two major contenders for the role of systemic paradigm, which would facilitate the realization of ubiquitous wireless networking. Against this background, we would like to maintain that in order to achieve the required level of integration, performance and efficiency, the future telecommunications technology may have to infer cues from the structural characteristics of the human society itself. Correspondingly, in this paper we would like to consider some of the relevant aspects of the societal constitution, which may hold crucial clues to identifying the promising avenues towards further technological advancement. More specifically, in this paper we explore the principle of heterogeneous wireless networking, constituted by the fusion of classic cellular and ad hoc network topologies. Specifically, we would like to maintain, that the heterogeneous network inherits the vital complementary characteristics of both aforementioned architectures, and thus has the potential of attaining the levels of performance and efficiency required by the future wireless communications.","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5395767/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 January 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5395767/","dateOfInsertion":"22 January 2010","publicationDate":"Feb. 2010","accessionNumber":"11102435","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"98","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Heterogeneous Networking: An Enabling Paradigm for Ubiquitous Wireless Communications [Point of View]","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Heterogeneous Networking: An Enabling Paradigm for Ubiquitous Wireless Communications [Point of View]","sourcePdf":"jproc-akhtman-2037213.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.036424S","chronDate":"Feb.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"5","isNumber":"5395752","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"5395752","articleId":"5395767","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":5395770,"authors":[{"name":"Anantha P.

An added challenge is that many of these applications have dynamic workloads. To reduce the energy consumption under these variable computation requirements, the underlying circuits must function efficiently over a wide range of supply voltages. This paper presents voltage-scalable circuits such as logic cells, SRAMs, ADCs, and dc-dc converters. Using these circuits as building blocks, two different applications are highlighted. First, we describe an H.264/AVC video decoder that efficiently scales between QCIF and 1080p resolutions, using a supply voltage varying from 0.5 V to 0.85 V. Second, we describe a 0.3 V 16-bit micro-controller with on-chip SRAM, where the supply voltage is generated efficiently by an integrated dc-dc converter.","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5395770/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 January 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2010","volume":"98","issue":"2","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11087576","dateOfInsertion":"22 January 2010","publicationDate":"Feb. 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5395770/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Technologies for Ultradynamic Voltage Scaling","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Technologies for Ultradynamic Voltage Scaling","sourcePdf":"jproc-finchelstein-2033621.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.155343S","chronDate":"Feb.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"5","isNumber":"5395752","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"95","xplore-issue":"5395752","articleId":"5395770","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5395771,"authors":[{"name":"Dejan Markovic","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, University of California, San Diego, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5/5395752/5395771/5395771-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Dejan Markovi\u0107 (Member, IEEE) received the Dipl.

Yet, the penalty in performance is huge. In this paper, we explore how design in the moderate inversion region helps to recover some of that lost performance, while staying quite close to the minimum-energy point. An energy-delay modeling framework that extends over the weak, moderate, and strong inversion regions is developed. The impact of activity and design parameters such as supply voltage and transistor sizing on the energy and performance in this operational region is derived. The quantitative benefits of operating in near-threshold region are established using some simple examples. The paper shows that a 20% increase in energy from the minimum-energy point gives back ten times in performance. Based on these observations, a pass-transistor based logic family that excels in this operational region is introduced. The logic family operates most of its logic in the above-threshold mode (using low-threshold transistors), yet containing leakage to only those in subthreshold. Operation below minimum-energy point of CMOS is demonstrated. In leakage-dominated ultralow-power designs, time-multiplexing will be shown to yield not only area, but also energy reduction due to lower leakage. Finally, the paper demonstrates the use of ultralow-power design techniques in chip synthesis.","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5395771/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 January 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2010","volume":"98","issue":"2","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11074180","dateOfInsertion":"22 January 2010","publicationDate":"Feb. 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5395771/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Ultralow-Power Design in Near-Threshold Region","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Ultralow-Power Design in Near-Threshold Region","sourcePdf":"jproc-markovic-2035453.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.101187S","chronDate":"Feb.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"5","isNumber":"5395752","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"250","xplore-issue":"5395752","articleId":"5395771","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5395777,"authors":[{"name":"Ching-Ling Huang","affiliation":["Systems Engineering group, Civil and Environmental Engineering Department, University of California Berkeley, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Ching-Ling Huang (chingling@berkeley.edu) received B.S. and M.S. degrees from National Taiwan University, both in electrical engineering.

In this article we propose a transmission control protocol that adapts communication rate and power based on the dynamics of a vehicular network and safety-driven tracking process.

As a cornerstone of the system, vehicles need to be aware of other vehicles in the vicinity. This cooperative awareness is achieved by beaconing, the exchange of periodic single-hop broadcast messages that include data on the status of a vehicle. While the concept of beaconing has been developed in the first phase of research on VANETs, recent studies have revealed limitations with respect to network performance. Obviously, the frequency of beacon messages directly translates into accuracy of cooperative awareness and thus traffic safety. There is an indisputable trade-off between required bandwidth and achieved accuracy. In this work we analyze this trade-off from different perspectives considering the consequences for safety applications. As a solution to the problem of overloading the channel, we propose to control the offered load by adjusting the beacon frequency dynamically to the current traffic situation while maintaining appropriate accuracy. To find an optimal adaptation, we elaborate on several options that arise when determining the beacon frequency. As a result, we propose situation-adaptive beaconing. It depends on the vehicle's own movement and the movement of surrounding vehicles, macroscopic aspects like the current vehicle density, or microscopic aspects.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.-Feb.  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5395778/","volume":"24","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/5395778/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan.-Feb. 2010","accessionNumber":"11087730","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"22 January 2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 January 2010","displayDocTitle":"Exploration of adaptive beaconing for efficient intervehicle safety communication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Exploration of adaptive beaconing for efficient intervehicle safety communication","sourcePdf":"006SCHMIDTLAYOUT.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.038604S","chronDate":"Jan.-Feb.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"65","isNumber":"5395772","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"65","citationCount":"139","xplore-issue":"5395772","articleId":"5395778","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":5395779,"authors":[{"name":"Rex Chen","affiliation":["University of California, Irvine, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Rex Chen (rex@uci.edu) is a Ph.D. candidate in computer science (networked systems) at the University of California, Irvine (UCI).

The ability of vehicles to communicate is a promising way to alleviate traffic accidents by reducing the response time associated with human reaction to nearby drivers. Vehicle mobility patterns caused by varying traffic dynamics and travel behavior lead to considerable complexity in the efficiency and reliability of vehicular communication networks.

However, a large range of ULP applications continue to face performance constraints at certain times that exceed the capabilities of subthreshold operation. In this paper, we give two different examples to show that designing flexibility into ULP systems across the architecture and circuit levels can meet both the ULP requirements and the performance demands. Specifically, we first present a method that expands on ultradynamic voltage scaling (UDVS) to combine multiple supply voltages with component level power switches to provide more efficient operation at any energy-delay point and low overhead switching between points. This system supports operation across the space from maximum performance, when necessary, to minimum energy, when possible. It thus combines the benefits of single-\n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">V</i>\n \n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">DD</sub>\n, multi-\n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">V</i>\n \n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">DD</sub>\n, and dynamic voltage scaling (DVS) while improving on them all. Second, we propose that reconfigurable subthreshold circuits can increase applicability for ULP embedded systems. Since ULP devices conventionally require custom circuit design but the manufacturing volume for many ULP applications is low, a subthreshold field programmable gate array (FPGA) offers a cost-effective custom solution with hardware flexibility that makes it applicable across a wide range of applications. We describe the design of a subthreshold FPGA to support ULP operation and identify key challenges to this effort.","doi":"10.1109/JPROC.2009.2037211","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel5/5/5395752/05395783.pdf","startPage":"267","endPage":"282","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5395752","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JPROC.2009.2037211","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Flexible Circuits and Architectures for Ultralow Power","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5395783","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2010","displayDocTitle":"Flexible Circuits and Architectures for Ultralow Power","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5395783/","publicationDate":"Feb. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"22 January 2010","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"11074181","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5395783/","volume":"98","issue":"2","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 January 2010","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Flexible Circuits and Architectures for Ultralow Power","sourcePdf":"jproc-calhoun-2037211.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.106704S","chronDate":"Feb.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"5","isNumber":"5395752","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"65","xplore-issue":"5395752","articleId":"5395783","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5395799,"authors":[{"name":"Chamni Jaipradidtham","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, Kasem Bundit University, Bangkok, Thailand"],"firstName":"Chamni","lastName":"Jaipradidtham","id":"37294374200"},{"name":"Prayuth Inban","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Faculty of Industrial Technology, Rajabhat Rajanagarindra University, Chachoengsao, Thailand"],"firstName":"Prayuth","lastName":"Inban","id":"37062974700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4546-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4547-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2159-3442"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2159-3450"}],"articleNumber":"5395799","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":554},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Discrete wavelet transforms","Impedance","Voltage","Transient analysis","AC-DC power converters","Harmonic analysis","Wavelet analysis","Power harmonic filters","Power system harmonics","HVDC transmission"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["AC-DC power convertors","discrete wavelet transforms","frequency response","HVDC power convertors","power harmonic filters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["harmonic impedances","voltage source transients model","pulse AC-DC converters","harmonic flow analysis","discrete wavelet transform","harmonic voltage source converter","harmonic domain algorithm","VSC-based HVDC converters","terminal bus voltage control","power exchange balance","frequency response","DWT filter banks","nonstationary power system waveforms"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["discrete wavelet transform","impedances","harmonic flow","voltage source converter","HVDC system"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents of harmonics flow analysis with the 12-pulse converters of HVDC link which are harmonic voltage source converter (VSC) in the AC-DC systems.

An illustrative example of applying the concept for an antenna problem is discussed.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5395818/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-26 Jan. 2009","publicationDate":"Nov. 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"23-26 Jan. 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5395818/","dateOfInsertion":"22 January 2010","accessionNumber":"11134959","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Applying micro GA concept for problems with large and rugged solution space","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Applying micro GA concept for problems with large and rugged solution space","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"P0568.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059857S","chronDate":"23-26 Jan. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5375730","isNumber":"5395786","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5375730","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5395786","articleId":"5395818","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5395835,"authors":[{"name":"Nagesh Prabhu","affiliation":["Canara Engineering College, Mangalore, India"],"firstName":"Nagesh","lastName":"Prabhu","id":"37417018900"},{"name":"M.

This can be achieved by suitable combination of passive elements and active FACTS controllers. In this paper, series passive compensation and shunt active compensation provided by a static synchronous compensator (STATCOM) connected at the electrical center of the transmission line are considered. This paper presents investigation of subsynchronous resonance (SSR) characteristics of the system and proposes a novel method for the extraction of subsynchronous component of line current using filter. The extracted subsynchronous frequency component of line current is injected to the system by the STATCOM which prevents the flow of subsynchronous current through the generator and increases the damping of the system at critical torsional frequencies. This novel technique is termed as subsynchronous current injector (SSCI). The design of SSCI is based on damping torque analysis. The 3-phase model of the STATCOM is based on switching functions. By neglecting harmonics in the switching function, D-Q model is derived which is combined with similar models of the other system components for linear analysis. The results of the linear analysis are validated by carrying out transient simulation based on the detailed nonlinear models.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5395835/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-26 Jan. 2009","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"23-26 Jan. 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5395835/","dateOfInsertion":"22 January 2010","publicationDate":"Nov. 2009","accessionNumber":"11102790","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Damping of subsynchronous resonance by subsynchronous current injector with STATCOM","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Damping of subsynchronous resonance by subsynchronous current injector with STATCOM","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"P0527.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053971S","chronDate":"23-26 Jan. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5375730","isNumber":"5395786","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5375730","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"5395786","articleId":"5395835","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":5395837,"authors":[{"name":"Rashmi Ramesh Rachh","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, KLE college of Engineering and Technology, Belgaum, India"],"firstName":"Rashmi Ramesh","lastName":"Rachh","id":"38096347400"},{"name":"B.

Define the stability region as the set of packet arrival rates for which finite queue lengths are feasible in the steady state. Consider perfect feedback of channel state information (CSI) and equal power allocation over the scheduled queues. The stability region is proved to be a convex polytope with the derived vertices. For any set of arrival rates in this region, multiuser queues are shown to be stabilized by the joint queue-and-beamforming control policy that maximizes the departure-rate-weighted sum of queue lengths. For quantized CSI feedback (limited feedback), the reduced stability region is proved to be inner bounded by the perfect-CSI counterpart multiplied by a factor close to one. This bound is achieved by scaling the number of feedback bits per mobile logarithmically with the inverse of the above factor.","doi":"10.1109/TENCON.2009.5395899","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5395786","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","pdfPath":"/iel5/5375730/5395786/05395899.pdf","publicationTitle":"TENCON 2009 - 2009 IEEE Region 10 Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"TENCON 2009 - 2009 IEEE Region 10 Conference","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TENCON.2009.5395899","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Stability of zero-forcing SDMA with limited feedback","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Stability","Multiaccess communication","Array signal processing","State feedback","Interference","Delay","Base stations","Space technology","Steady-state","Channel state information"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antennas","array signal processing","feedback","space division multiple access"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["stability","zero-forcing SDMA","limited feedback","multi-antenna space division multiple access","zero-forcing beamforming","packet data services","channel state information"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"23-26 Jan. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Stability of zero-forcing SDMA with limited feedback","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5395899/","dateOfInsertion":"22 January 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5395899/","accessionNumber":"11102830","publicationDate":"Nov. 2009","conferenceDate":"23-26 Jan. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Stability of zero-forcing SDMA with limited feedback","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"P1288.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068254S","chronDate":"23-26 Jan. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5375730","isNumber":"5395786","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5375730","xplore-issue":"5395786","articleId":"5395899","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5395914,"authors":[{"name":"Young Ju Hwang","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Yonsei University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Young Ju","lastName":"Hwang","id":"37652803000"},{"name":"Seung-Woo Ko","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Yonsei University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Seung-Woo","lastName":"Ko","id":"37875789200"},{"name":"Sang Il Lee","affiliation":["Agency for Defence Development, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Sang Il","lastName":"Lee","id":"37678085100"},{"name":"Byoung In Cho","affiliation":["Agency for Defence Development, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Byoung In","lastName":"Cho","id":"37671869600"},{"name":"Seong-Lyun Kim","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Yonsei University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Seong-Lyun","lastName":"Kim","id":"37279276000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4546-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4547-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2159-3442"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2159-3450"}],"articleNumber":"5395914","dbTime":"71 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":99},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5395914","abstract":"To maximize the gain of multi-hop transmissions, we have to let the number of hops as small as possible, decreasing multi-hop transmission delay. In this paper, we propose how the average number of hop counts can be reduced in wireless multi-hop networks by constructing a few long-range edges that can act as if they were highways in the networks. For this purpose, we adopt the concept of small-world phenomenon and suggest two methods for giving randomness in connectivity, power control and beamforming. Based on these methods, we investigate how the network capacity can be improved by utilizing the small-world characteristics. From our numerical examples, we have found that power control with single antenna decreases not the average hop counts, but also the end-to-end throughput of the network. Power control with beamforming, however, can somewhat overcome this throughput degradation only with two antennas, where the average number of hop counts is reduced like in small-world networks.","doi":"10.1109/TENCON.2009.5395914","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","displayPublicationTitle":"TENCON 2009 - 2009 IEEE Region 10 Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5375730/5395786/05395914.pdf","publicationTitle":"TENCON 2009 - 2009 IEEE Region 10 Conference","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TENCON.2009.5395914","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5395786","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Wireless small-world networks with beamforming","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Array signal processing","Spread spectrum communication","Wireless networks","Wireless sensor networks","Power control","Road transportation","Throughput","Base stations","Wires","Network topology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","power control","radio networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wireless small-world networks","beamforming","multihop transmission delay","wireless multihop networks","power control","network capacity","end-to-end throughput"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5395914/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-26 Jan. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Wireless small-world networks with beamforming","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5395914/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"22 January 2010","conferenceDate":"23-26 Jan. 2009","accessionNumber":"11102842","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Wireless small-world networks with beamforming","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"P1201.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057771S","chronDate":"23-26 Jan. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5375730","isNumber":"5395786","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5375730","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5395786","articleId":"5395914","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5395917,"authors":[{"name":"Hao Yu","affiliation":["Department of Electronic and Computer Engineering, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Hao","lastName":"Yu","id":"37593343500"},{"name":"Shunqing Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Electronic and Computer Engineering, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Shunqing","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37403497400"},{"name":"Vincent K.N.

In the network MIMO systems, open-loop transmission scheme is used to support mobiles with high mobilities because the BSs do not need to track the fast varying channel fading. In this paper, we consider an open-loop network MIMO system with L BSs serving L+1 mobiles based on partial cooperation where all the L BSs cooperatively serve a cell-edge MS. Exploiting the heterogeneous path loss between cell-center MS and cell-edge MS, each of the L BS also serves a cell-center MS non-cooperatively. We first propose a flexible open-loop SDMA scheme to address potential issues associated with dynamic and heterogeneous MIMO configurations and to adjust the long-term power allocation between the cell-edge MS (cooperatively served by L BSs) and the cell-center MS at each of the L BSs, we formulate the long-term distributive power control problem using game theoretic approach. Through numerical simulations, we show that the proposed open-loop SDMA scheme with distributed long-term power allocation can achieve significant performance advantages over the other reference baseline schemes.","doi":"10.1109/TENCON.2009.5395917","publicationTitle":"TENCON 2009 - 2009 IEEE Region 10 Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"TENCON 2009 - 2009 IEEE Region 10 Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5375730/5395786/05395917.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TENCON.2009.5395917","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5395786","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Game theoretical power control for open-loop network MIMO systems with partial cooperation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5395917","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Game theoretical power control for open-loop network MIMO systems with partial cooperation","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-26 Jan. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5395917/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"23-26 Jan. 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2009","accessionNumber":"11134995","dateOfInsertion":"22 January 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5395917/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Game theoretical power control for open-loop network MIMO systems with partial cooperation","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"P1200.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053648S","chronDate":"23-26 Jan. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5375730","isNumber":"5395786","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5375730","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5395786","articleId":"5395917","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5395935,"authors":[{"name":"Seung Chun Bae","affiliation":["School of Electronic Engineering, Soongsil University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Seung Chun","lastName":"Bae","id":"38258164000"},{"name":"Jae Wook Park","affiliation":["School of Electronic Engineering, Soongsil University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Jae Wook","lastName":"Park","id":"37859424300"},{"name":"Won Cheol Lee","affiliation":["School of Electronic Engineering, Soongsil University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Won Cheol","lastName":"Lee","id":"37335553500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4546-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4547-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2159-3442"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2159-3450"}],"articleNumber":"5395935","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":77},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5395935","abstract":"To alleviate positioning error using wireless ultra wideband (UWB) is primary concern, and it has been studied how to reduce the positioning error effectively. Thanks to many repeated transmissions of UWB signals, we can have a variety of selections to point out the most precise positioning result. Towards this, scanning method has been preferred to be used due to its simplicity. This exhaustive method firstly fixes the candidate position, and calculates the sum of distances from observed positions. However, it has tremendous number of computations, and the complexity is more serious if the size of two-dimensional range is the larger.

Two major types of spread spectrum multiple access (SSMA) schemes are: i. direct sequence spread spectrum (DSSS) and ii. frequency hopped multiple access (FHMA). The benefits and technical advantages of CDMA could be translated in the optical-CDMA (OCDMA) for faster data throughput and better physical layer security. In this paper prime and one-coincidence frequency hop codes are being analyzed for auto-and-cross correlation properties and applied in an optical fiber Bragg grating array (FBGA) to study multiple access interference (MAI) in an optical fast-frequency hopping code division multiple access (OFFH-CDMA) system. A novel frequency-overlapping multigroup scheme for a passive OFFH-CDMA is being used for high speed code hopping, higher spectral efficiency, and interference reduction. In this paper OFFH-CDMA with frequency-overlapping multigroup scheme using prime code is proposed and the result is compared with the previously reported paper. The BER of the proposed prime code shows better performance with respect to one-coincidence code.","doi":"10.1109/TENCON.2009.5395957","publicationTitle":"TENCON 2009 - 2009 IEEE Region 10 Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"TENCON 2009 - 2009 IEEE Region 10 Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5375730/5395786/05395957.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TENCON.2009.5395957","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5395786","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An optical fast-frequency hopping code division multiple access (OFFH-CDMA) system using Fiber Bragg Grating Array (FBGA) with frequency-overlapping multigroup of prime codes","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5395957","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-26 Jan. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5395957/","displayDocTitle":"An optical fast-frequency hopping code division multiple access (OFFH-CDMA) system using Fiber Bragg Grating Array (FBGA) with frequency-overlapping multigroup of prime codes","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2009","accessionNumber":"11102867","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5395957/","conferenceDate":"23-26 Jan. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"22 January 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An optical fast-frequency hopping code division multiple access (OFFH-CDMA) system using Fiber Bragg Grating Array (FBGA) with frequency-overlapping multigroup of prime codes","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"P0854.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.035768S","chronDate":"23-26 Jan. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5375730","isNumber":"5395786","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5375730","xplore-issue":"5395786","articleId":"5395957","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5395966,"authors":[{"name":"Bidyadhar Subudhi","affiliation":["Center of Industrial Electronics & Robotics, Department of Electrical Engineering, National Institute of Technology, Rourkela, India"],"firstName":"Bidyadhar","lastName":"Subudhi","id":"38475274600"},{"name":"Debashisha Jena","affiliation":["Center of Industrial Electronics & Robotics, Department of Electrical Engineering, National Institute of Technology, Rourkela, India"],"firstName":"Debashisha","lastName":"Jena","id":"37585323600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4546-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4547-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2159-3442"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2159-3450"}],"articleNumber":"5395966","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":11,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":856},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Nonlinear systems","MIMO","Neural networks","System identification","Laboratories","Transmission line measurements","Multilayer perceptrons","Multi-layer neural network","Search methods","Genetic algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["backpropagation","genetic algorithms","identification","MIMO systems","multilayer perceptrons","nonlinear systems","particle swarm optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["twin rotor MIMO system","multiinput multioutput system","multilayer perceptron","genetic algorithm","particle swarm optimization","differential evolution","gradient descent method","backpropagation algorithm","evolving neural networks","memetic algorithm","nonlinear system identification"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Differential evolution","Evolutionary computation","Nonlinear system identification","Back propagation","Twin rotor system"]}],"abstract":"This work presents system identification using neural network approaches for modelling a laboratory based twin rotor multi-input multi-output system (TRMS).

In most previous works on relay-based cellular networks, immediate relaying at relay stations (RSs) was assumed, without allowing the opportunistic scheduling at RSs. Hence, each RS should transmit the received data from the base station (BS) to the corresponding mobile stations (MSs) immediately within a single time-slot and the effective data rate of the two-hop transmission (BS-RS and RS-MS links) is limited by the achievable data rate of the link with worse channel state among two links, resulting in wastes of radio resources. However, if the opportunistic scheduling is allowed at each RS, the time-varying channel state of each link can be fully exploited, and thus more efficient radio resource allocation is possible. Hence, in this paper, we consider an opportunistic subchannel scheduling at both BS and RSs. We formulate a stochastic optimization problem that aims at maximizing the average sum-rate of the relay-based network where the time-varying wireless channel is modeled as a stochastic process. By solving the problem, we develop an optimal opportunistic subchannel scheduling algorithm for both BS and RSs. Numerical results show that we can significantly improve system performance by allowing the opportunistic scheduling at RSs.","doi":"10.1109/TENCON.2009.5396001","publicationTitle":"TENCON 2009 - 2009 IEEE Region 10 Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"TENCON 2009 - 2009 IEEE Region 10 Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5375730/5395786/05396001.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TENCON.2009.5396001","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5395786","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Opportunistic subchannel scheduling for OFDMA cellular networks with scheduling at relay stations","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5396001","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Opportunistic subchannel scheduling for OFDMA cellular networks with scheduling at relay stations","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-26 Jan. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5396001/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"23-26 Jan. 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2009","accessionNumber":"11102895","dateOfInsertion":"22 January 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5396001/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Opportunistic subchannel scheduling for OFDMA cellular networks with scheduling at relay stations","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"P1147.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048659S","chronDate":"23-26 Jan. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5375730","isNumber":"5395786","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5375730","xplore-issue":"5395786","articleId":"5396001","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5396002,"authors":[{"name":"R Savitha","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"firstName":"R","lastName":"Savitha","id":"37662267900"},{"name":"S Vigneswaran","affiliation":["Continental AG, Singapore"],"firstName":"S","lastName":"Vigneswaran","id":"38109084800"},{"name":"S Suresh","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology, New Delhi, India"],"firstName":"S","lastName":"Suresh","id":"37270114200"},{"name":"N Sundararajan","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"firstName":"N","lastName":"Sundararajan","id":"37268927700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4546-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4547-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2159-3442"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2159-3450"}],"articleNumber":"5396002","dbTime":"26 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":16,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":535},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Array signal processing","Radial basis function networks","Adaptive arrays","Signal processing algorithms","Least squares approximation","Interference","Sensor arrays","Neural networks","Direction of arrival estimation","Antenna arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive antenna arrays","array signal processing","beam steering","electrical engineering computing","interference","learning (artificial intelligence)","radial basis function networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive beamforming","fully complex-valued radial basis function neural networks","array signal processing problem","beam pattern","sensors","beam pointing","interference direction","null-steering","learning speed","matrix method"]}],"abstract":"Beamforming is an array signal processing problem of forming a beam pattern of an array of sensors.

With regards to convergence, using the full cycle implementation the DWT's initial response was faster but reached the new value at the same time as the DFT. Using the half cycle implementation the effect is more pronounced with higher levels of recursion of the DWT showing a further improvement of its performance. With regards to the decaying DC offset, using the full cycle implementation the DWT was largely affected by the DC offset, whereas the DFT was able to filter the majority of it out and give an accurate phasor estimation. With the half cycle implementation both did poorly with much oscillation around the nominal value. A method for removing the decaying DC offset prior to the phasor estimation algorithm would be required.","doi":"10.1109/TENCON.2009.5396018","publicationTitle":"TENCON 2009 - 2009 IEEE Region 10 Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"TENCON 2009 - 2009 IEEE Region 10 Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5375730/5395786/05396018.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TENCON.2009.5396018","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5395786","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Evaluation of Discrete Wavelet Transform implementation for protective relaying","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5396018","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Evaluation of Discrete Wavelet Transform implementation for protective relaying","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-26 Jan. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5396018/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"23-26 Jan. 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2009","accessionNumber":"11135029","dateOfInsertion":"22 January 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5396018/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Evaluation of Discrete Wavelet Transform implementation for protective relaying","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"P0931.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.083904S","chronDate":"23-26 Jan. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5375730","isNumber":"5395786","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5375730","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5395786","articleId":"5396018","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5396024,"authors":[{"name":"Htay Htay Yee","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"firstName":"Htay Htay","lastName":"Yee","id":"38112051700"},{"name":"Foo Say Wei","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"firstName":"Foo Say","lastName":"Wei","id":"37271090000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4546-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4547-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2159-3442"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2159-3450"}],"articleNumber":"5396024","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":145},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Watermarking","Error correction codes","Time frequency analysis","Galois fields","Psychoacoustic models","Linear code","Streaming media","Character generation","Encoding","Energy states"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["audio coding","cyclic codes","error correction codes","time-frequency analysis","watermarking"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["audio watermarking","error-correcting code","two-channel time-frequency digital bits","cyclic code","time-frequency compression-expansion technique","psychoacoustic model","stereo audio signal"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Audio signal","digital watermarking","two-channel compression-expansion","error-correcting codes"]}],"abstract":"A non-blind two-channel time-frequency digital bits audio watermarking scheme with error-correcting code is described in this paper.

A comparative study is made in different training algorithms - particle swarm optimization (PSO), genetic algorithm (GA), gradient descent (GD) and hybrid of PSO&GD for neural network in the mentioned problem. Simulation results show superiority of hybrid algorithm (a combination of GD&PSO) as optimizer over other techniques.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-26 Jan. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5396064/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11102931","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5396064/","publicationDate":"Nov. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"22 January 2010","conferenceDate":"23-26 Jan. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"PSO & neural-network based signature recognition for harmonic source identification","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"PSO & neural-network based signature recognition for harmonic source identification","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"P1113.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068842S","chronDate":"23-26 Jan. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5375730","isNumber":"5395786","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5375730","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"5395786","articleId":"5396064","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":5396075,"authors":[{"name":"Jhing-Fa Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Jhing-Fa","lastName":"Wang","id":"37280532500"},{"name":"Yung-Chuan Jiang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Yung-Chuan","lastName":"Jiang","id":"37422039500"},{"name":"Zheng-Wei Sun","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Zheng-Wei","lastName":"Sun","id":"37676998000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4546-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4547-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2159-3442"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2159-3450"}],"articleNumber":"5396075","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":185},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"FPGA implementation of a novel far-field sound localization system","abstract":"Sound localization systems (SLS) identify the direction of a sound source.

Techniques like Prony analysis and Kalman filter have been proposed to extract oscillation parameters. However, Prony analysis finds it difficult to detect time-varying parameters and the performance of Kalman Filter, which is an adaptive tracking method, is dependent on initial conditions. Therefore, in this paper, Extended Complex Kalman Filter (ECKF) is investigated to adaptively detect multiple poorly damped power system oscillations under noisy conditions. Unlike Kalman Filter, the proposed technique is nonlinear and uses Hankel Singular Value Decomposition (HSVD) to accurately estimate its initial conditions. Thus, the convergence rate can be significantly improved. Additionally, the HSVD-based ECKF is capable of approximating multiple damping factors as well as the standard frequency parameters.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5395786","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TENCON.2009.5396137","publicationTitle":"TENCON 2009 - 2009 IEEE Region 10 Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"TENCON 2009 - 2009 IEEE Region 10 Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5375730/5395786/05396137.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doi":"10.1109/TENCON.2009.5396137","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Detection of lightly damped inter-area power oscillations using extended complex Kalman Filter","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-26 Jan. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Detection of lightly damped inter-area power oscillations using extended complex Kalman Filter","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"23-26 Jan. 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5396137/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2009","accessionNumber":"11102976","dateOfInsertion":"22 January 2010","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5396137/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Detection of lightly damped inter-area power oscillations using extended complex Kalman Filter","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"P0444.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052795S","chronDate":"23-26 Jan. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5375730","isNumber":"5395786","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5375730","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"5395786","articleId":"5396137","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":5396138,"authors":[{"name":"Yutana Jewajinda","affiliation":["National Science and Technology Development Agency, National Electronics and Computer Technology Center, Bangkok, Thailand"],"firstName":"Yutana","lastName":"Jewajinda","id":"37658555000"},{"name":"Prabhas Chongstitvatana","affiliation":["Department of Computer Engineering, Chulalongkom University, Bangkok, Thailand"],"firstName":"Prabhas","lastName":"Chongstitvatana","id":"37299250300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4546-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4547-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2159-3442"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2159-3450"}],"articleNumber":"5396138","dbTime":"20 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":127},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hardware","Field programmable gate arrays","Genetic algorithms","Computer architecture","Concurrent computing","Pipelines","Genetic engineering","Evolutionary computation","Workstations","Distributed processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","genetic algorithms","parallel architectures"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hardware architecture","FPGA","parallel elitism-based compact genetic algorithm","EC-CGA","probability model migration"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Hardware","FPGA","Genetic algorithms"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5396138","abstract":"This paper presents hardware architecture and FPGA implementation of a parallel genetic algorithm called elitism-based compact genetic algorithm (EC-CGA).

The cooperative MIMO scheme is employed in the outer cell while a single base station serves in the inner cell. We compare two types of model and give those performances.

Finally, a simple method to lower the peak transient voltage is proposed.","doi":"10.1109/TENCON.2009.5396164","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TENCON.2009.5396164","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","displayPublicationTitle":"TENCON 2009 - 2009 IEEE Region 10 Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5375730/5395786/05396164.pdf","publicationTitle":"TENCON 2009 - 2009 IEEE Region 10 Conference","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5395786","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Simulation analysis of transient behavior of class E amplfiier due to load variation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"23-26 Jan. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Simulation analysis of transient behavior of class E amplfiier due to load variation","conferenceDate":"23-26 Jan. 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"22 January 2010","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5396164/","accessionNumber":"11104876","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5396164/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Simulation analysis of transient behavior of class E amplfiier due to load variation","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"P0397.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.032273S","chronDate":"23-26 Jan. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5375730","isNumber":"5395786","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5375730","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5395786","articleId":"5396164","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":5396167,"authors":[{"name":"Mukul Sutaone","affiliation":["Electronics and Telecommunication, College of Engineering, Pune, India"],"firstName":"Mukul","lastName":"Sutaone","id":"37568550800"},{"name":"Madan Mali","affiliation":["Electronics and Telecommunication, College of Engineering, Pune, India"],"firstName":"Madan","lastName":"Mali","id":"37567974600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4546-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4547-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2159-3442"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2159-3450"}],"articleNumber":"5396167","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":77},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Random access memory","Mathematical model","Semiconductor memory","Energy consumption","Embedded computing","Engines","Power dissipation","Fault tolerance","Signal design","Signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fault tolerance","low-power electronics","SRAM chips","vector quantisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["rhythmic codebook","semiconductor memory","SRAM chips","vector quantizers","gating transistor power saving technique","power dissipation","access time","fault tolerance","bitline passive leakage","codebook memory","voltage 300 V","memory size 32 KByte","power 0.25 muW","voltage 620 mV","voltage 500 mV"]}],"abstract":"The effective design of semiconductor memory pertaining to the power consumption, speed and area penalty has always been the crucial task in embedded computing applications.

The channel estimator is based on the theory of polynomial prediction and Taylor series expansion of the underlying channel model in time domain. It is a simplification of a previously developed generalized recursive least squares (GRLS) estimator, achieved by replacing the online recursive computation of the `intermediate' matrix by an offline pre-computed matrix. Similar to the GRLS estimator, it is able to operate in Rayleigh or Rician fading environment without reconfiguration of the state transition matrix to accommodate the non-random mean components. Simulation results show that it is able to offer a trade-off between reduced complexity channel estimation and good system performance.","doi":"10.1109/TENCON.2009.5396185","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5395786","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","pdfPath":"/iel5/5375730/5395786/05396185.pdf","publicationTitle":"TENCON 2009 - 2009 IEEE Region 10 Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"TENCON 2009 - 2009 IEEE Region 10 Conference","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TENCON.2009.5396185","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A reduced complexity channel estimation algorithm with equalization","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Channel estimation","Decision feedback equalizers","Error analysis","Polynomials","Taylor series","Predictive models","Least squares approximation","Recursive estimation","State estimation","Rician channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","decision feedback equalisers","least mean squares methods","polynomial approximation","Rayleigh channels","Rician channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["reduced complexity channel estimation algorithm","decision feedback equalizer","minimum mean square error","Taylor series expansion","polynomial prediction","generalized recursive least squares estimator","Rician fading","Rayleigh fading","state transition matrix"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"23-26 Jan. 2009","displayDocTitle":"A reduced complexity channel estimation algorithm with equalization","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5396185/","dateOfInsertion":"22 January 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5396185/","accessionNumber":"11135072","publicationDate":"Nov. 2009","conferenceDate":"23-26 Jan. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A reduced complexity channel estimation algorithm with equalization","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"P0345.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049811S","chronDate":"23-26 Jan. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5375730","isNumber":"5395786","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5375730","xplore-issue":"5395786","articleId":"5396185","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5396201,"authors":[{"name":"B.

The frequency response of the CUT is simulated under various fault conditions and the corresponding bandwidth for each fault is obtained. It can be observed that the bandwidth is different for different fault conditions. Therefore using fault dictionary all single and multiple faults in the CUT can be detected. The fuzzy inference system is used to classify the faults effectively. The feasibility of this method is validated through second order Sallen-Key band pass filter and fourth order Leapfrog low pass filter circuits.

H.264. The conventional implementation does some approximation to the transform matrix elements to facilitate integer arithmetic, for which hardware is suitably prepared. Though the transform coding does not involve any multiplications, quantization process requires sixteen 16-bit multiplications. The algorithm used here eliminates the process of approximation in transform coding and multiplication in the quantization process, by usage of algebraic integer coding. We propose an area-efficient implementation of the transform and quantization blocks based on the algebraic integer coding. The designs were synthesized with 90 nm TSMC CMOS technology and were also implemented on a Xilinx FPGA.

The increasing importance of embedded SRAM is due to its low circuit activity factor, leading to low active power density, and productivity of design. The power consumption has become an important issue and has lead to the development of numerous schemes aimed at limiting that component of power during both standby and active operation. In the present paper, we have proposed a symmetric 11-T SRAM cell to reduce power consumption during read/write operation. We have simulated the designed circuit with the help of Tanner EDA tools for 0.25 \u00bfm technology and simulated results were compared with 6T and ZA cell. It was found that proposed cell consumes 28% lower power than conventional 6T during write mode. During read operation, the average power saving is around 33% compared to conventional cell. The write delay is more in our proposed cell. By choosing width of tail transistors are equal to 3 \u00bfm, the write delay of the proposed cell can be equated to conventional cell.","doi":"10.1109/TENCON.2009.5396237","publicationTitle":"TENCON 2009 - 2009 IEEE Region 10 Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"TENCON 2009 - 2009 IEEE Region 10 Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5375730/5395786/05396237.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TENCON.2009.5396237","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5395786","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5396237","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A proposed symmetric and balanced 11-T SRAM cell for lower power consumption","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-26 Jan. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5396237/","displayDocTitle":"A proposed symmetric and balanced 11-T SRAM cell for lower power consumption","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5396237/","publicationDate":"Nov. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"22 January 2010","conferenceDate":"23-26 Jan. 2009","accessionNumber":"11104922","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A proposed symmetric and balanced 11-T SRAM cell for lower power consumption","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"P0199.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.103179S","chronDate":"23-26 Jan. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5375730","isNumber":"5395786","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5375730","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"5395786","articleId":"5396237","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5396242,"authors":[{"name":"T.

The proposed fast blind equalization algorithm applies the two-stage convergence scheme and the SDD part uses the scheme with an adaptively selected decision region. In the first convergence stage, the joint GMMA and modified SDD equalization is applied for the purpose of the fast convergence. When the convergence process reaches the enough steady state, the convergence detector changes the first stage equalization to the second stage. In the second stage, the modified SDD scheme is applied to reduce the mean square error (MSE) further. On the wired cable channel at the 64/256/1024QAM modes, the proposed blind algorithm performs faster convergence speed than the previous blind methods do; meanwhile, the proposed algorithm also achieves smaller MSE than the other methods at the same signal-to-noise ratio (SNR).","displayPublicationTitle":"TENCON 2009 -

The system presented in this article considers user requirements, including novel advances, all in an integral home automation solution suitable for many services. The architecture's modular nature allows direct adaptation to specific cases using standard domotic technologies, for managing in-house devices, and a proposal of an IP-based network for connecting the main home automation module with other platform elements. A remote security system has been developed, and managing tasks are enabled via in-home control panels and an advanced 3D application for local and remote homeowner access. The system has been deployed on a prototype house, testing a wide set of domotic services. Moreover, the range of indoor pervasive applications has also been extended to e-health, elderly adaptation, greenhouse automation, and energy efficiency.","doi":"10.1109/MPRV.2010.20","publicationTitle":"IEEE Pervasive Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Pervasive Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/7756/5586685/05396313.pdf","startPage":"66","endPage":"77","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MPRV.2010.20","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5586685","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5396313","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Integral and Networked Home Automation Solution for Indoor Ambient Intelligence","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"An Integral and Networked Home Automation Solution for Indoor Ambient Intelligence","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5396313/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 January 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"October-December  2010","volume":"9","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5396313/","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2011","publicationDate":"October-December 2010","accessionNumber":"11729570","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Integral and Networked Home Automation Solution for Indoor Ambient Intelligence","sourcePdf":"mpc2010040066.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.037093S","chronDate":"October-December  2010","xplore-pub-id":"7756","isNumber":"5586685","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7756","citationCount":"90","xplore-issue":"5586685","articleId":"5396313","onlineDate":"22 January 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-21"},{"_id":5396331,"authors":[{"name":"Mingqiang Li","affiliation":["Institute of High-Performance Computing, Department of Computer Science and Technology, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/12/5557296/5396331/5396331-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Mingqiang Li received the BSc degree in mathematics from the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China in 2006 and is currently working toward the PhD degree in the Department of Computer Science and Technology at Tsinghua University.

All the existing technologies based on the conventional disk can provide very limited performance improvement. This paper presents a new Disk Architecture with Composite Operation (DACO), whose disk media access interface consists of three kinds of operations: READ, WRITE, and Composite Operation (CO). The CO adopts a sector-based pipeline technology to implement block-level data modify operations, and thus, can replace the read-modify-write operations involved in small-write operations. When the DACO is adopted in a large-scale erasure-coded storage system with t fault tolerance, t I/Os and t disk media access operations can be reduced in each small-write operation, respectively. This alleviates both I/O congestion and disk media access congestion in nature, and thus, can remarkably improve the performance of large-scale erasure-coded storage systems. A simulation study shows that the DACO can provide significant performance improvement: reducing the average I/O response time by up to 31.16 percent even in the worst case where t=1. This paper also discusses the important implementation issues of the DACO and investigates the additional cost involved in the DACO.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"DACO: A High-Performance Disk Architecture Designed Specially for Large-Scale Erasure-Coded Storage Systems","doi":"10.1109/TC.2010.22","endPage":"1362","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/12/5557296/05396331.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","startPage":"1350","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TC.2010.22","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5557296","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5396331","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Media","Strips","Fault tolerance","Fault tolerant systems","Disk drives","Data mining","Computer architecture"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["digital storage","disc storage","pipeline processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["high performance disk architecture designed","large scale erasure coded storage systems","I/O congestion","disk media access congestion","read-modify-write operations","Disk Architecture with Composite Operation","disk media access interface","sector based pipeline technology","fault tolerance"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Disk architecture","erasure code","small-write problem","storage system."]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"DACO: A High-Performance Disk Architecture Designed Specially for Large-Scale Erasure-Coded Storage Systems","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5396331/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 January 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2010","volume":"59","issue":"10","htmlLink":"/document/5396331/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"26 August 2010","accessionNumber":"11498734","isDynamicHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"DACO: A High-Performance Disk Architecture Designed Specially for Large-Scale Erasure-Coded Storage Systems","sourcePdf":"ttc2010101350.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.150633S","chronDate":"Oct.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"12","isNumber":"5557296","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"5557296","articleId":"5396331","onlineDate":"22 January 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":5396333,"authors":[{"name":"Martin Oma\u00f1a","affiliation":["DEIS, University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/12/5586714/5396333/5396333-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Martin Oma\u00f1a received the degree in electronic engineering from the University of Buenos Aires, Argentina, in 2000, and the PhD degree in electronic engineering and computer science from the Electronics Department of the University of Bologna, Italy, in 2005, which he joined in 2002 after receiving a MADESS grant and is now a postdoctoral fellow.

The underlying idea is to learn a map from input low-resolution images to target high-resolution images based on example pairs of input and output images. Kernel ridge regression (KRR) is adopted for this purpose. To reduce the time complexity of training and testing for KRR, a sparse solution is found by combining the ideas of kernel matching pursuit and gradient descent. As a regularized solution, KRR leads to a better generalization than simply storing the examples as has been done in existing example-based algorithms and results in much less noisy images. However, this may introduce blurring and ringing artifacts around major edges as sharp changes are penalized severely. A prior model of a generic image class which takes into account the discontinuity property of images is adopted to resolve this problem. Comparison with existing algorithms shows the effectiveness of the proposed method.","doi":"10.1109/TPAMI.2010.25","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel5/34/5452163/05396341.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPAMI.2010.25","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5452163","startPage":"1127","endPage":"1133","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Single-Image Super-Resolution Using Sparse Regression and Natural Image Prior","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5396341","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Single-Image Super-Resolution Using Sparse Regression and Natural Image Prior","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5396341/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 January 2010","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"32","issue":"6","publicationDate":"June 2010","accessionNumber":"11256715","pubMedId":"20431136","dateOfInsertion":"19 April 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5396341/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Single-Image Super-Resolution Using Sparse Regression and Natural Image Prior","sourcePdf":"ttp2010061127.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.069844S","chronDate":"June  2010","xplore-pub-id":"34","isNumber":"5452163","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"533","xplore-issue":"5452163","articleId":"5396341","onlineDate":"22 January 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-22"},{"_id":5397174,"authors":[{"name":"Shimon Even","affiliation":["Applied Mathematics Department, Sperry Rand Research Center, Sudbury, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Shimon","lastName":"Even","id":"37323315700"}],"articleNumber":"5397174","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":26},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Automata","Automatic testing","Delay"]}],"abstract":"A generalized model of automata is defined in which the outputs are sequences of letters (rather than single letters) for each input letter.

Likewise, the same theorem permits unnecessary input variables to be eliminated. Next, the table is \"unitized\" by complementing those rows where F is to be O. Finally, a reduction theorem often permits many of the rows of this \"unitized\" table to be eliminated. Various synthesis procedures are described based on this reduced table. Two \"canonical\" realizations are shown which follow immediately from the table. A more comprehensive procedure for three-input gates is then described.

The following types of theorems are proved: From an arbitrary incomplete machine M a machine M* is constructed which is transition complete, i.e., has a transition defined for every state and every input. Given a special type of partition of Q we construct from M a machine M' whose states correspond to the members of the partition. Relations between the C-classes of M and M' are given, and in particular, sufficient conditions are given for which the state minimization problems for M and M' are equivalent. Through the use of a class of sets of states \"generated\" by a given set of states of M, and a restricted type of compatibility relation between sets of states, certain sets of compatible states are shown not to be elements of any minimum C-class for M. Conditions are given on compatible sets S and S' of Q, where S' S/supseteq$S, such that if S is an element of a C-class Sigma for M, then (Sigma- {S}) $\\cup$ {S'} is a C-class for M.

Particularly significant among these advantages is the feature of testability. One would naturally expect that the iterative structure and the short intercell connections of a cellular logic array would allow it to be tested from its edge terminals much more easily than a relatively disorganized interconnection of the same number of gates. In this paper we confirm this conjecture, and we describe procedures for deriving minimal (or near-minimal) schedules of test inputs, to be applied to a combinational cellular array in order to detect the presence of any single faulty cell. In addition, necessary and sufficient conditions are presented for some types of arrays of unilaterally connected, identical cells to be completely testable for single faults. For one-dimensional arrays, these conditions are based upon known results in sequential network theory. For two-dimensional arrays, a relationship to the \"domino problem\" (which is known to be insoluble) is described, but is shown to be largely avoidable and nonrestricting in the present case.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-20 Oct. 1967","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5397209/","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"18-20 Oct. 1967","publicationDate":"Oct. 1967","dateOfInsertion":"22 January 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Testing for faults in combinational cellular logic arrays","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Testing for faults in combinational cellular logic arrays","confLoc":"Austin, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"5397209.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.033014S","chronDate":"18-20 Oct. 1967","isNumber":"5397191","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5397190","citationCount":"143","articleId":"5397209","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1967","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5397244,"authors":[{"name":"R.

The only restriction on circuit configurations is that no feedback loops may occur. The procedure is an outgrowth of one given by Roth. The decomposition techniques are generalizations of those discussed by Ashenhurst. Given a function F (A, B, C), where A, B, and C are states of binary variables and F may have don't care combinations, a representation of the form F = G [alpha (A, B), B, C] is called decomposition of F. Any loop-free circuit can be described by a sequence of decompositions. Efficient procedures for the detection of decompositions are given in terms of a convenient normal form representation of switching functions. Simplifications obtained by considering only the subclass of so called vertex-functions are discussed. The program carries out a systematic search through the admissable sequences of decompositions, using a lexicographic ordering, designed so that the most promising sequences are investigated first. Several further refinements are used to limit the search. The calculation yields a list of successively improved implementations, eventually including one of minimum cost. Examples are given of several circuits of minimum or near minimum cost derived by the program.","doi":"10.1109/FOCS.1961.1","publicationTitle":"2nd Annual Symposium on Switching Circuit Theory and Logical Design (SWCT 1961)","displayPublicationTitle":"2nd Annual Symposium on Switching Circuit Theory and Logical Design (SWCT 1961)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5397266/5397267/05397283.pdf","startPage":"182","endPage":"194","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FOCS.1961.1","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5397267","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A computer program for the synthesis of combinational switching circuits","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A computer program for the synthesis of combinational switching circuits","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"22 January 2010","publicationDate":"Oct. 1961","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5397283/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-20 Oct. 1961","conferenceDate":"17-20 Oct. 1961","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A computer program for the synthesis of combinational switching circuits","confLoc":"Detroit, MI, USA","sourcePdf":"5397283.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.030667S","chronDate":"17-20 Oct. 1961","isNumber":"5397267","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5397266","citationCount":"15","articleId":"5397283","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1961","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5397284,"authors":[{"name":"C.

The synchronous cells in these networks have unit switching delays separating their receipts of external x and left-neighbor alpha inputs from their corresponding productions of external z and right-neighbor alpha outputs. Three basic types of alpha transient behavior are discussed for such networks. In the first type, all transients extend to no more than a bounded number of cells to the right of each x change; in the second, all transients propagate all the way to the right boundary of the network; and in the third, any transient may or may not propagate to the right boundary of the network depending upon the x sequence to the right of the x change in question. In all three cases, necessary and sufficient conditions are given on the type of alpha logic allowed. These conditions are expressed in terms of corresponding alpha state graph structure. The paper's main results hinge on certain properties of a new type of state subgraph, and on an indirect application of permutation groups to the state-pair transition problem. A section of examples proves that individual graphs can contain any mixture of the above three types of transient behavior.","doi":"10.1109/FOCS.1961.13","publicationTitle":"2nd Annual Symposium on Switching Circuit Theory and Logical Design (SWCT 1961)","displayPublicationTitle":"2nd Annual Symposium on Switching Circuit Theory and Logical Design (SWCT 1961)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5397266/5397267/05397289.pdf","startPage":"133","endPage":"151","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5397267","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FOCS.1961.13","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5397289","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-20 Oct. 1961","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5397289/","displayDocTitle":"Delayed-logic and finite-state machines","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 1961","dateOfInsertion":"22 January 2010","conferenceDate":"17-20 Oct. 1961","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Delayed-logic and finite-state machines","confLoc":"Detroit, MI, USA","sourcePdf":"5397289.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.022503S","chronDate":"17-20 Oct. 1961","isNumber":"5397267","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5397266","citationCount":"35","articleId":"5397289","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1961","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5397302,"authors":[{"name":"Saburo Muroga","affiliation":["IBM Research Center, Yorktown Heights, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Saburo","lastName":"Muroga","id":"37318515700"}],"articleNumber":"5397302","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":45},"abstract":"Functional forms of the majority functions and a wider class of functions, called \"dual-comparable functions are discussed.

The method employs the integer linear programming algorithm developed by R. E. Gomory and takes advantage of a new technique for obtaining the required integer matrix. From a boolean function Phi A = |aij| is defined by setting aij = 1 if prime implicant j covers canonical term i and aij = 0 otherwise. Then, for example, minimization of the expression Sigma jxj, subject to restrictions Sigma jaijxj $\\gg$ 1 and xj a non-negative integer, is equivalent to obtaining a normal form for Phi with a minimal number of clauses. In practice A can be advantageously reduced in size prior to the integer programming. This reduced matrix is obtainable fairly directly from an expression for Phi by a succession of simple operations. The method has been programmed for the IBM 704 and tested on several hundred problems. In speed and range of problems solvable, it compares favorably with minimization techniques presently in use.","doi":"10.1109/FOCS.1961.5","publicationTitle":"2nd Annual Symposium on Switching Circuit Theory and Logical Design (SWCT 1961)","displayPublicationTitle":"2nd Annual Symposium on Switching Circuit Theory and Logical Design (SWCT 1961)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5397266/5397267/05397308.pdf","startPage":"3","endPage":"9","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FOCS.1961.5","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5397267","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An application of linear programming to the minimization of Boolean functions","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5397308","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-20 Oct. 1961","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5397308/","displayDocTitle":"An application of linear programming to the minimization of Boolean functions","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 1961","conferenceDate":"17-20 Oct. 1961","dateOfInsertion":"22 January 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An application of linear programming to the minimization of Boolean functions","confLoc":"Detroit, MI, USA","sourcePdf":"5397308.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.023328S","chronDate":"17-20 Oct. 1961","isNumber":"5397267","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5397266","citationCount":"14","articleId":"5397308","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1961","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":5397344,"authors":[{"name":"Qiucheng Deng","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Science and Technology, University of Science and Technology, Hefei, Anhui, China"],"firstName":"Qiucheng","lastName":"Deng","id":"38112760800"},{"name":"Xuefei Bai","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Science and Technology, University of Science and Technology, Hefei, Anhui, China"],"firstName":"Xuefei","lastName":"Bai","id":"37592488500"},{"name":"Li Guo","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Science and Technology, University of Science and Technology, Hefei, Anhui, China"],"firstName":"Li","lastName":"Guo","id":"37306672000"},{"name":"Yao Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Science and Technology, University of Science and Technology, Hefei, Anhui, China"],"firstName":"Yao","lastName":"Wang","id":"37678502300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4668-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4669-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2159-2144"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2159-2160"}],"articleNumber":"5397344","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":238},"abstract":"In this paper, a fast hardware implementation of multiplicative inversion in GF(2\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">m</sup>\n) using the optimal normal basis of type II is presented.

This paper designs three peripheral circuits that are needed in the building process, including row-selecting circuit suitable for the dual control signal character of 9T SRAM cell, simplified writing circuit that can effectively pull down the bit-lines and choose which to pull with only three N-type transistors and power-reduced sense amplifier with its switch transistor controlled by the logic `and' result of one external and two internal signals that can shut down the circuit when there is enough voltage difference between outputs. The active power consumption of the sense amplifier with and-gate is 38% lower than the one without it.

We model the licensed channel as a finite-state Markov channel (FSMC) and the CR user selects one channel to access and decides transmission rate and power in order to maximize its energy efficiency. We propose a game theoretic framework to formulate this problem and apply a learning algorithm called modified regret-matching leading to correlated equilibrium which is more practical than the regret-matching learning algorithm applied in the related work. The only thing that each user needs to know is his own realized payoffs and actions. From the simulation results, the modified learning algorithm provides impressive performance.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICICS.2009.5397468","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5397465","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 7th International Conference on Information, Communications and Signal Processing (ICICS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5383381/5397465/05397468.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Energy-efficient dynamic spectrum access using no-regret learning","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5397468/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 Dec. 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5397468/","displayDocTitle":"Energy-efficient dynamic spectrum access using no-regret learning","conferenceDate":"8-10 Dec. 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","accessionNumber":"11089171","dateOfInsertion":"22 January 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy-efficient dynamic spectrum access using no-regret learning","confLoc":"Macau, China","sourcePdf":"WeA43P0657.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.075005S","chronDate":"8-10 Dec. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5383381","isNumber":"5397465","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5383381","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5397465","articleId":"5397468","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5397471,"authors":[{"name":"Nan Li","affiliation":["National Key Laboratory of Science and Technology on Communications, University of Electronic Science and Technology, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Nan","lastName":"Li","id":"38107063600"},{"name":"Lei Gong","affiliation":["National Key Laboratory of Science and Technology on Communications, University of Electronic Science and Technology, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Lei","lastName":"Gong","id":"37647956400"},{"name":"Shaoqian Li","affiliation":["National Key Laboratory of Science and Technology on Communications, University of Electronic Science and Technology, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Shaoqian","lastName":"Li","id":"37279617000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4656-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4657-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5397471","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":175},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Relays","Routing","Cognitive radio","Pricing","Laboratories","Communications technology","Consumer electronics","Base stations","Interference","Iterative algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","pricing","spread spectrum communication","telecommunication network routing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["price based spectrum allocation relay routing","cognitive radio network","collaborative routing strategy","pricing scheme","cognitive radio base station","network profit maximization","iterative price adaptation","route selection"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cognitive radio","HSSN","spectrum allocation","pricing scheme","relay routing"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Price-based spectrum-allocation relay routing in cognitive radio networks","doi":"10.1109/ICICS.2009.5397471","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5397465","endPage":"5","publicationTitle":"2009 7th International Conference on Information, Communications and Signal Processing (ICICS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 7th International Conference on Information, Communications and Signal Processing (ICICS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5383381/5397465/05397471.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICICS.2009.5397471","startPage":"1","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5397471","abstract":"In this paper, we consider a collaborative routing strategy in cognitive radio network.

It is known that the segregate quality of FD-BSS degrades severely in the challenging scenario of reverberant enclosures or moving source situations. A robust two-stage dynamic programming approach based on inter-frequency correlation is presented to solving the permutation ambiguity correction problem. Moreover, binary masking method and the non-stationary spectral subtraction techniques are combined to estimate and reduce the residual cross-talk components. The subtraction parameter is adaptively determined by estimated local Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR). An optimization scheme is proposed aiming at obtaining a tradeoff between the residual noise reduction and generated distortion suppression.

Previous works in MIMO two-way relay network have focused on an equidistant topology of the relay nodes. However such a topology rarely exists in a practical situation. In a non-equidistant topology, the end-to-end network capacity degrades severely due to the bottleneck link caused by uneven SNR. Furthermore, the end-to-end network capacity also degrades at high SNR due to overreach interference from far nodes existing in multi-hop relay networks. In this paper, we focus on the non-equidistant topology of the MIMO two-way relay network, and apply three transmit power allocation schemes for balancing and maximizing the SINR of each link, i.e. Eigen-value based Power Allocation (EPA), Optimal Power Allocation (OPA) and Distributed Power Allocation (DPA) schemes. The efficiency of proposed schemes is validated using numerical simulations.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 7th International Conference on Information, Communications and Signal Processing (ICICS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5383381/5397465/05397526.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","publicationTitle":"2009 7th International Conference on Information, Communications and Signal Processing (ICICS)","doi":"10.1109/ICICS.2009.5397526","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICICS.2009.5397526","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5397465","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5397526","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Power allocation for MIMO two-way relay network","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Relays","Network topology","Spread spectrum communication","Degradation","Signal to noise ratio","Multiple access interference","Interference cancellation","Power engineering and energy","Numerical simulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO communication","telecommunication network topology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO two-way relay network","multihop relay networks","nonequidistant topology","end-to-end network capacity","power allocation schemes","optimal power allocation schemes","distributed power allocation schemes","SINR","eigenvalue based power allocation schemes"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["MIMO two-way relay network","power allocation","perron-frobenius theorem","quasi-convex"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5397526/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 Dec. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Power allocation for MIMO two-way relay network","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5397526/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","accessionNumber":"11119308","dateOfInsertion":"22 January 2010","conferenceDate":"8-10 Dec. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Power allocation for MIMO two-way relay network","confLoc":"Macau, China","sourcePdf":"WeA52P0576.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047796S","chronDate":"8-10 Dec. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5383381","isNumber":"5397465","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5383381","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5397465","articleId":"5397526","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":5397527,"authors":[{"name":"Yun-Jung Hsieh","affiliation":["Graduate Institute of Communication Engineering, National Chi Nan University, Nantou, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Yun-Jung","lastName":"Hsieh","id":"37399776400"},{"name":"Hong-Wei Shieh","affiliation":["Graduate Institute of Communication Engineering, National Chi Nan University, Nantou, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Hong-Wei","lastName":"Shieh","id":"37397961000"},{"name":"Yinman Lee","affiliation":["Graduate Institute of Communication Engineering, National Chi Nan University, Nantou, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Yinman","lastName":"Lee","id":"37407199500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4656-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4657-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5397527","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":77},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","MIMO","Transmitting antennas","Diversity reception","Fourier transforms","Receiving antennas","System performance","Computational modeling","Multipath channels","Computational complexity"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","block codes","communication complexity","fast Fourier transforms","MIMO communication","OFDM modulation","receiving antennas","space-time codes","transmitting antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["preFFT combining","STBC-OFDM systems","space-time block-code","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing systems","signal-to-noise ratio","semidefinite relaxation","transmit-receive antennas","multipath channel","computational complexity","multiple-input multiple-output channel","MIMO","prefast Fourier transform"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM)","multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)","space-time block code (STBC)","pre-fast Fourier transform (pre-FFT) combining","max-min fair criterion"]}],"abstract":"Recently, pre-fast Fourier transform (pre-FFT) combining has been introduced for space-time block-coded (STBC) orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems.

Simulation results show that the error-rate performance of the proposed pre-FFT combining scheme can be improved as compared with that of the conventional one under various numbers of transmit/receive antennas and multipath channel environments with affordable computational complexity.","doi":"10.1109/ICICS.2009.5397527","publicationTitle":"2009 7th International Conference on Information, Communications and Signal Processing (ICICS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 7th International Conference on Information, Communications and Signal Processing (ICICS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5383381/5397465/05397527.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICICS.2009.5397527","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5397465","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Pre-FFT combining with balanced subcarrier performance for STBC-OFDM systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5397527","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 Dec. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5397527/","displayDocTitle":"Pre-FFT combining with balanced subcarrier performance for STBC-OFDM systems","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","accessionNumber":"11119309","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5397527/","conferenceDate":"8-10 Dec. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"22 January 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Pre-FFT combining with balanced subcarrier performance for STBC-OFDM systems","confLoc":"Macau, China","sourcePdf":"WeA53P0571.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043518S","chronDate":"8-10 Dec. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5383381","isNumber":"5397465","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5383381","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5397465","articleId":"5397527","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5397528,"authors":[{"name":"Tai Liu","affiliation":["School of Information and Telecommunication Engineering, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Peking, China"],"firstName":"Tai","lastName":"Liu","id":"37986254700"},{"name":"Junjie Chen","affiliation":["School of Information and Telecommunication Engineering, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Peking, China"],"firstName":"Junjie","lastName":"Chen","id":"37068908100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4656-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4657-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5397528","dbTime":"17 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":184},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Downlink","Array signal processing","MIMO","Transmitting antennas","Constraint optimization","Base stations","Lagrangian functions","Receiving antennas","Signal to noise ratio","Transmitters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","MIMO communication","optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["joint downlink transmit beamforming","receive beamforming","power allocation","multiuser multiple-input multiple-output downlink","Lagrangian dual","per-antenna power constrained optimization","virtual uplink noises","MIMO downlink"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5397528","doi":"10.1109/ICICS.2009.5397528","publicationTitle":"2009 7th International Conference on Information, Communications and Signal Processing (ICICS)","abstract":"Conditioned with per-antenna power constraints, power allocation over transmit antennas must be controlled in joint optimization of transmit beamformers and receive beam-formers in multi-user multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) downlink.

We propose an interference mitigation method that changes the time-frequency code (TFC) number of transmitter for the desired piconet according to the packet error rate (PER) of the two TFCs colliding. This proposed method can reduce the symbol collisions of SOP interference effectively.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5397567/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 Dec. 2009","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","accessionNumber":"11089209","htmlLink":"/document/5397567/","dateOfInsertion":"22 January 2010","publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","conferenceDate":"8-10 Dec. 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Interference mitigation for simultaneous operating piconets in MB-OFDM systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Interference mitigation for simultaneous operating piconets in MB-OFDM systems","confLoc":"Macau, China","sourcePdf":"WeM64P0632.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.039821S","chronDate":"8-10 Dec. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5383381","isNumber":"5397465","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5383381","xplore-issue":"5397465","articleId":"5397567","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5397575,"authors":[{"name":"Qingyi Quan","affiliation":["Wireless Signal Processing and Network Laboratory Key Laboratory of Universal Wireless Communication, Ministry of Education, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Qingyi","lastName":"Quan","id":"37280114500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4656-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4657-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5397575","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":149},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hopfield neural networks","OFDM","Phase noise","Performance evaluation","Bit error rate","Interference","Signal design","Transmitters","Phase estimation","Automatic testing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["error statistics","Hopfield neural nets","intercarrier interference","OFDM modulation","phase noise","radio receivers","radio transmitters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multilevel Hopfield neural network","OFDM system","phase noise","common phase error","intercarrier interference","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","OFDM signal receiver","transmitter","matrix estimation","self-evolution","likelihood function","HNN based detection","single carrier system","bit error rate","BER performance"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Hopfield neural network","OFDM","ICI","Phase noise"]}],"abstract":"Phase noise causes common phase error (CPE) and intercarrier interference (ICI) in orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) system. To mitigate the effects of phase noise, many schemes have been proposed, but they are either computationally complex or at the price of sacrificing spectral efficiency. In this paper, a continuous Hopfield neural network (HNN) is designed for OFDM signal receiver as a component to mitigate the effects of phase noise. This component does not require any special assistance from transmitter side, but it should be used in conjunction with phase noise matrix estimation. HNN, through self-evolution, performances likelihood test with possible symbols, and outputs a symbol for which the likelihood function has a relatively large value. The performance of the proposed HNN based detection is evaluated via computer simulations and compared to both the conventional detection and a single carrier system. It is shown that the HNN based detection can significantly improve the bit error rate (BER) performance in the presence of phase noise.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A multilevel Hopfield neural network for OFDM system with phase noise","publicationTitle":"2009 7th International Conference on Information, Communications and Signal Processing (ICICS)","doi":"10.1109/ICICS.2009.5397575","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 7th International Conference on Information, Communications and Signal Processing (ICICS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5383381/5397465/05397575.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICICS.2009.5397575","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5397465","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5397575","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5397575/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 Dec. 2009","displayDocTitle":"A multilevel Hopfield neural network for OFDM system with phase noise","conferenceDate":"8-10 Dec. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5397575/","dateOfInsertion":"22 January 2010","publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","accessionNumber":"11089211","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A multilevel Hopfield neural network for OFDM system with phase noise","confLoc":"Macau, China","sourcePdf":"WeP21P0562.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067416S","chronDate":"8-10 Dec. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5383381","isNumber":"5397465","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5383381","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5397465","articleId":"5397575","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5397576,"authors":[{"name":"Chia-Peng Chou","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Chi Nan University, Nantou, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chia-Peng","lastName":"Chou","id":"38184068300"},{"name":"Wen-Jeng Lin","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Chi Nan University, Nantou, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Wen-Jeng","lastName":"Lin","id":"38024051800"},{"name":"Jung-Shan Lin","affiliation":["Graduate Institute of Communication Engineering, National Chi Nan University, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Jung-Shan","lastName":"Lin","id":"37349894800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4656-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4657-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5397576","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":145},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Timing","Frequency synchronization","OFDM modulation","Wireless LAN","Redundancy","Computational complexity","DSL","Quadrature amplitude modulation","Degradation","System performance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","distortion","error compensation","frequency division multiple access","OFDM modulation","synchronisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["timing synchronization","zero-padding preambles","OFDM systems","signal distortion","timing error compensation","computational complexity"]}],"abstract":"Synchronization for both time and frequency is a well-known issue in OFDM systems.

When implementing multi-view video coding, there are lots of temporal and inter-viewpoint redundancy among viewpoints, which makes the compression work more challenging. It is found that the inter-viewpoint relationship is subject to the epipolar geometry, which provides constraints between the two image sequences of multi-view video. To efficiently encode data-intensive multi-view imaging content, a fast disparity estimation (DE) search method is proposed in this paper based on the rectified epipolar lines. Theoretical analysis and experimental results prove that the proposed disparity estimation search method can efficiently confine the search range in the process of disparity estimation.

In recent publication, a cross-layer design employing multiple antenna techniques and network coding called MIMO two-way relay is proposed for one dimensional mesh network. Owing to interference cancellation ability of MIMO, bi-directional flow multiplexing capability of network coding in combination with an efficient channel access scheme of TDMA/TDD, MIMO two-way relay provides significantly high end-to-end capacity. In this paper, we propose MIMO two-way relay as an alternative PHY/MAC protocol of CSMA/CA.

The error probability for each fading channel is estimated fast and accurately by using Gauss quadrature rules (GQR) which can approximate the probability density function (pdf) of the ISI-like CCI in each fading channel.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5397608/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 Dec. 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"8-10 Dec. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"22 January 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5397608/","accessionNumber":"11089228","displayDocTitle":"Exact error probability for MMSE combining and comparison with maximal ratio combining for digital radio with cochannel interference","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Exact error probability for MMSE combining and comparison with maximal ratio combining for digital radio with cochannel interference","confLoc":"Macau, China","sourcePdf":"TuM54P0238.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.083473S","chronDate":"8-10 Dec. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5383381","isNumber":"5397465","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5383381","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5397465","articleId":"5397608","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":5397609,"authors":[{"name":"Mahdi Shaghaghi","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"firstName":"Mahdi","lastName":"Shaghaghi","id":"37593379600"},{"name":"Yong Liang Guan","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"firstName":"Yong Liang","lastName":"Guan","id":"37272208800"},{"name":"Kui Cai","affiliation":["Data Storage Institute, National University of Singapore, Singapore"],"firstName":"Kui","lastName":"Cai","id":"37391393000"},{"name":"Zhiliang Qin","affiliation":["Data Storage Institute, National University of Singapore, Singapore"],"firstName":"Zhiliang","lastName":"Qin","id":"37401670400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4656-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4657-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5397609","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":188},"abstract":"In this paper, the combined normalized and offset min-sum algorithm is proposed for efficient decoding of low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes in optical and magnetic storage systems.

The performance improvement is presented for a partial response magnetic recording channel. Our simulations are based on an LDPC code from the class of finite-geometry LDPC codes. It will be shown that the proposed method has a performance very close to that of the belief propagation algorithm which has a much higher complexity.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 7th International Conference on Information, Communications and Signal Processing (ICICS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5383381/5397465/05397609.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","publicationTitle":"2009 7th International Conference on Information, Communications and Signal Processing (ICICS)","doi":"10.1109/ICICS.2009.5397609","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICICS.2009.5397609","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5397465","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5397609","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Combined normalized and offset min-sum decoding over partial response channels","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Partial response channels","Parity check codes","Iterative decoding","Belief propagation","Iterative algorithms","Detectors","Magnetic memory","Magnetic recording","Computational complexity","Degradation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decoding","error statistics","parity check codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["combined normalized decoding","offset min-sum decoding","partial response channels","low-density parity-check codes","optical storage systems","magnetic storage systems","BER performance","finite-geometry LDPC codes","belief propagation algorithm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Turbo decoding","LDPC codes","belief propagation","normalized/offset min-sum algorithms"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5397609/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 Dec. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Combined normalized and offset min-sum decoding over partial response channels","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5397609/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","accessionNumber":"11089229","dateOfInsertion":"22 January 2010","conferenceDate":"8-10 Dec. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Combined normalized and offset min-sum decoding over partial response channels","confLoc":"Macau, China","sourcePdf":"TuM47P0410.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049722S","chronDate":"8-10 Dec. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5383381","isNumber":"5397465","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5383381","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5397465","articleId":"5397609","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5397610,"authors":[{"name":"Yunxin Li","affiliation":["NICTA, Eveleigh, NSW, Australia"],"firstName":"Yunxin","lastName":"Li","id":"37538213600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4656-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4657-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5397610","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":164},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Modems","Quadrature amplitude modulation","Baseband","Chip scale packaging","Standards development","OFDM modulation","Channel coding","Convolutional codes","Convolution","Reed-Solomon codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["convolutional codes","costing","modems","OFDM modulation","Reed-Solomon codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["OFDM modem","soft-demapping scheme","square QAM constellation","R-QAM constellation","convolutional codes","Reed-Solomon codes","optimum log-likelihood ratio demapper","frequency 60 GHz"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["60 GHz","Gigabit wireless modem","LLR","OFDM","QAM","Reed-Solomon code","Soft-decision decoding","Viterbi algorithm"]}],"abstract":"A simple soft-demapping scheme for rectangular quadrature amplitude modulation (R-QAM) signals is developed for a low-cost 60 GHz OFDM baseband chip design, conforming to the IEEE802.15.3C standard.

In this paper, fractional base station cooperation cellular network (FBSC-CN) is proposed in which a combination of single BS MIMO and BSC multiuser (MU) MIMO is performed in order to achieve gains both at the cell-inner and cell-edge with limited complexity. Furthermore, by cooperating with each BS autonomously and distributedly, cooperative BSs are able to select the most suitable transmission schemes to the users accordingly.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICICS.2009.5397644","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5397465","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 7th International Conference on Information, Communications and Signal Processing (ICICS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5383381/5397465/05397644.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fractional Base Station Cooperation Cellular Network","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5397644/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 Dec. 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5397644/","displayDocTitle":"Fractional Base Station Cooperation Cellular Network","conferenceDate":"8-10 Dec. 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","accessionNumber":"11089246","dateOfInsertion":"22 January 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fractional Base Station Cooperation Cellular Network","confLoc":"Macau, China","sourcePdf":"TuA52P0590.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068296S","chronDate":"8-10 Dec. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5383381","isNumber":"5397465","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5383381","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"5397465","articleId":"5397644","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5397645,"authors":[{"name":"Han Zhang","affiliation":["School of Physics & Telecommunications, South China Normal University, Guangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Han","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37406824600"},{"name":"Xianhua Dai","affiliation":["Department of Electronics, School of Information Science & Technology, Guangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Xianhua","lastName":"Dai","id":"37279595100"},{"name":"Dong Li","affiliation":["Department of Electronics, School of Information Science & Technology, Guangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Dong","lastName":"Li","id":"37290665000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4656-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4657-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5397645","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":224},"abstract":"In this paper, we present a low-complexity equalizer for orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems over rapidly time-varying multi-path channels.

The normal K-best sphere decoding algorithm (SDA) can guarantee a fixed throughput, but it induces a large bit error rate (BER) degradation. In order to achieve close-to-ML performance, the K value needs to be sufficiently large. Thus, it needs large computation with long latency and low throughput. In this paper, a reconfigurable K-best SDA is proposed by using fixed K values for different layers of K-best detection, which can increase the MIMO detection performance.

Here, we iteratively learn a guidance vector field from training data and recover the missing region by solving the Poisson equation using the learned guidance vector field with Dirichlet boundary conditions. In addition, we also propose a method to select the best training set by using the correlation between neighboring patches of the damaged input image and training images.

In addition, the results in various cases of the PLI show that the proposed technique is superior to the results of the ASIC algorithm.","doi":"10.1109/ICICS.2009.5397681","publicationTitle":"2009 7th International Conference on Information, Communications and Signal Processing (ICICS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 7th International Conference on Information, Communications and Signal Processing (ICICS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5383381/5397465/05397681.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICICS.2009.5397681","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5397465","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An enhanced adaptive algorithm for PLI cancellation in ECG signals","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5397681","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"An enhanced adaptive algorithm for PLI cancellation in ECG signals","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 Dec. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5397681/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"8-10 Dec. 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","accessionNumber":"11119335","dateOfInsertion":"22 January 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5397681/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An enhanced adaptive algorithm for PLI cancellation in ECG signals","confLoc":"Macau, China","sourcePdf":"ThP24P0165.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046186S","chronDate":"8-10 Dec. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5383381","isNumber":"5397465","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5383381","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"5397465","articleId":"5397681","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5397694,"authors":[{"name":"Chia-Hao Yang","affiliation":["Department of Electric Engineering, National Taiwan Ocean University, Keelung, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chia-Hao","lastName":"Yang","id":"38106419700"},{"name":"Hoang-Yang Lu","affiliation":["Department of Electric Engineering, National Taiwan Ocean University, Keelung, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Hoang-Yang","lastName":"Lu","id":"37274986700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4656-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4657-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5397694","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":29},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multiuser detection","Multiaccess communication","Detectors","Bit error rate","Multiple access interference","Degradation","Oceans","Computational complexity","Computational modeling","High performance computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiple access","computational complexity","error statistics","multiuser detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["group decision aided multiuser detection","overloaded multirate CDMA","uplink multirate code division multiple access systems","computational complexity","MMSE criterion","bit error rate","BER performance"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we present a multistage group-decision-aid MUD (MG-MUD) for the uplink multirate code division multiple access (CDMA) systems. To provide good tradeoff between the performance and computational complexity, the new MUD is based on the widely MMSE criterion and constructed by a bank of group detectors in each stage. First, the users are classified into different groups according to their transmission rates. Thereafter, these groups of users are detected in parallel by the set of the group detectors stage by stage. In addition, in each stage of the new MUD, the decision outputs of the group detectors are gleaned to refine the interference estimates to enhance the detection. To further reduce the computational overheads, the reduce-complexity MG-MUD is also presented, which divides the multiple symbols of the users in the higher rate groups into appropriate subgroups according to their transmission orders.

Single carrier cyclic prefix (SCCP) is used in the system to combat intersymbol interference (ISI) in frequency-selective fading channels. The transmission process is divided into two phases. At phase 1, both users send their information to R simultaneously. R then amplifies and transmits its received signals at Phase 2. We propose an algorithm to estimate the channel information at end users based on the least-square principle. To further minimize the mean square error (MSE) of the estimate, a method to design the optimal training sequences is also proposed. The proposed method does not estimate individual channels between each end user and R but incorporates them into composite channels. Simulation results show that the performance achieved by our optimal design is close to that with perfect channel information.","doi":"10.1109/ICICS.2009.5397702","publicationTitle":"2009 7th International Conference on Information, Communications and Signal Processing (ICICS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 7th International Conference on Information, Communications and Signal Processing (ICICS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5383381/5397465/05397702.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICICS.2009.5397702","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5397465","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimum training sequence design for multi-input multi-output (MIMO) two-way wireless relay networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5397702","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Optimum training sequence design for multi-input multi-output (MIMO) two-way wireless relay networks","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 Dec. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5397702/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"8-10 Dec. 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","accessionNumber":"11134792","dateOfInsertion":"22 January 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5397702/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimum training sequence design for multi-input multi-output (MIMO) two-way wireless relay networks","confLoc":"Macau, China","sourcePdf":"ThM42P0731.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052681S","chronDate":"8-10 Dec. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5383381","isNumber":"5397465","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5383381","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5397465","articleId":"5397702","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5397707,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaomin Cao","affiliation":["National ICT Australia (NICTA) Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University of Melbourne, VIC, Australia"],"firstName":"Xiaomin","lastName":"Cao","id":"38041493400"},{"name":"Margreta Kuijper","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University of Melbourne, VIC, Australia"],"firstName":"Margreta","lastName":"Kuijper","id":"37282995700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4656-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4657-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5397707","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":63},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Source coding","Polynomials","Block codes","Hamming distance","Image coding","Shift registers","Parity check codes","Decoding","Image sensors","Sensor phenomena and characterization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["block codes","cyclic codes","matrix algebra","parity check codes","source coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed source coding","cyclic codes","multiple correlated sources","Hamming distance","parity check matrix","block code"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5397707","abstract":"We consider the problem of compression of multiple correlated sources.

Landmark recognition is one of the mobile applications that are gaining more attention in recent years. The main idea of the application is that a user will use a camera phone to capture the image of a landmark or building and then the system will analyze, identify, and inform the user the name of the captured landmark together with its related information. A new mobile landmark recognition method is proposed in this paper: first, a set of multi-scale patches are extracted from the landmark images. Discriminative patches of the images are then selected based on a Gaussian mixture model (GMM). A combination of color, texture and scale-invariant feature transform (SIFT) descriptors are then extracted from the selected patches. They are used to train support vector machine (SVM) classifiers for each category of landmark. Experimental results using a database of 4000 landmark images illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A multi-scale learning approach for landmark recognition using mobile devices","publicationTitle":"2009 7th International Conference on Information, Communications and Signal Processing (ICICS)","doi":"10.1109/ICICS.2009.5397713","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 7th International Conference on Information, Communications and Signal Processing (ICICS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5383381/5397465/05397713.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICICS.2009.5397713","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5397465","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5397713","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5397713/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 Dec. 2009","displayDocTitle":"A multi-scale learning approach for landmark recognition using mobile devices","conferenceDate":"8-10 Dec. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5397713/","dateOfInsertion":"22 January 2010","publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","accessionNumber":"11134797","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A multi-scale learning approach for landmark recognition using mobile devices","confLoc":"Macau, China","sourcePdf":"ThM14P0400.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.11839S","chronDate":"8-10 Dec. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5383381","isNumber":"5397465","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5383381","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"5397465","articleId":"5397713","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5397728,"authors":[{"name":"Yadong Liu","affiliation":["National Key Laboratory of Science and Technology on Communications, University of Electronic Science and Technology, Chengdu, Sichuan, China"],"firstName":"Yadong","lastName":"Liu","id":"38106671600"},{"name":"Gang Wu","affiliation":["National Key Laboratory of Science and Technology on Communications, University of Electronic Science and Technology, Chengdu, Sichuan, China"],"firstName":"Gang","lastName":"Wu","id":"37290990500"},{"name":"Shu Fang","affiliation":["National Key Laboratory of Science and Technology on Communications, University of Electronic Science and Technology, Chengdu, Sichuan, China"],"firstName":"Shu","lastName":"Fang","id":"37401407600"},{"name":"Xianxue Fan","affiliation":["National Key Laboratory of Science and Technology on Communications, University of Electronic Science and Technology, Chengdu, Sichuan, China"],"firstName":"Xianxue","lastName":"Fan","id":"37672423200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4656-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4657-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5397728","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":232},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Downlink","MIMO","Resource management","Radiofrequency interference","Processor scheduling","Interchannel interference","Laboratories","Communications technology","Base stations","Nash equilibrium"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","cochannel interference","interference suppression","iterative methods","MIMO communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["base station scheduling","iterative power allocation","multicell downlink MIMO systems","multicell cochannel interference mitigation","interbase communication","signaling overhead","threshold judgment","semidistributed dynamic resource allocation scheme","Nash equilibrium theory","power allocation methods"]}],"abstract":"Coordinated multiple point transmission and reception (CoMP) has attracted a lot of attention recently because of its potential for multi-cell co-channel interference (CCI) mitigation and spectral efficiency increase. CoMP inevitably requires increased signaling overhead and inter-base communication. Therefore in practice, only a limited number of Base Stations (BS) can cooperate with acceptable overhead. In addition, the resource allocation is another intrinsic problem of CoMP. In this paper, a novel scheme of BS scheduling based on threshold judgment has been proposed by taking into count the complexity reduce. Simulation results show that the BS scheduling scheme with lower complexity we proposed can achieve the same performance as that mentioned in. We also develope a semi-distributed dynamic resource allocation scheme based on Nash equilibrium (NE) theory for the downlink of multi-cell systems with spectrum reuse factor of 1. It is quantified the improvement in the terms of system capacity and transmission power reduction compared with the existing power allocation methods.","doi":"10.1109/ICICS.2009.5397728","publicationTitle":"2009 7th International Conference on Information, Communications and Signal Processing (ICICS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 7th International Conference on Information, Communications and Signal Processing (ICICS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5383381/5397465/05397728.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICICS.2009.5397728","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5397465","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"BS scheduling and iterative power allocation for the multi-cell downlink MIMO systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5397728","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 Dec. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5397728/","displayDocTitle":"BS scheduling and iterative power allocation for the multi-cell downlink MIMO systems","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","accessionNumber":"11134810","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5397728/","conferenceDate":"8-10 Dec. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"22 January 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"BS scheduling and iterative power allocation for the multi-cell downlink MIMO systems","confLoc":"Macau, China","sourcePdf":"ThA53P0169.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058033S","chronDate":"8-10 Dec. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5383381","isNumber":"5397465","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5383381","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5397465","articleId":"5397728","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":5397738,"authors":[{"name":"Pham Duc Long","affiliation":["Thai Nguyen University Vietnam, Thai Nguyen, Vietnam"],"firstName":"Pham Duc","lastName":"Long","id":"38179901700"},{"name":"Pham Thuong Cat","affiliation":["Institute of Information Technology, Vietnam Academy of Science and Technology, Hanoi, Vietnam"],"firstName":"Pham Thuong","lastName":"Cat","id":"37396639300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4656-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4657-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5397738","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":91},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Speckle","Cellular neural networks","Filters","Anisotropic magnetoresistance","Noise reduction","Image processing","Information technology","Ultrasonic imaging","Turing machines","Concurrent computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular neural nets","hybrid simulation","image denoising","speckle"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["real time speckle reduction","cellular neural network universal machine","ultrasound images","SAR images","hybrid parallel computing structure","hybrid serial computing structure","real time image processing","speckle noise reduction"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Speckle Reducing Anisotropic Diffusion","Image processing","Celllular Neural Network"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5397738","abstract":"Speckle noises often appear in ultrasound and SAR images and demand for speckle reducing in real-time is increasing in many applications.

Level shifters allow for effective interfacing between voltage domains supplied by different voltage levels. In this paper we present a low power level shifters in the 90 nm technology node capable of converting subthreshold voltage signals to above threshold voltage signals. The level shifter makes use of MTCMOS design technique which gives more design flexibility, especially in low power systems. Post layout simulations indicate low power consumption and low energy consumption across process-, mismatch- and temperature variations. Minimum input voltage attainable while maintaining robust operation is found to be around 180 mV, at maximum frequency of 1 MHz. The level shifter employs an enable/disable feature, allowing for power saving when the level shifter is not in use.","doi":"10.1109/NORCHP.2009.5397793","publicationTitle":"2009 NORCHIP","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 NORCHIP","pdfPath":"/iel5/5374435/5397790/05397793.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NORCHP.2009.5397793","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5397790","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Low-power subthreshold to above threshold level shifter in 90 nm process","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5397793","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-17 Nov. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5397793/","displayDocTitle":"Low-power subthreshold to above threshold level shifter in 90 nm process","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2009","accessionNumber":"11089284","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5397793/","conferenceDate":"16-17 Nov. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"22 January 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low-power subthreshold to above threshold level shifter in 90 nm process","confLoc":"Trondheim, Norway","sourcePdf":"9203.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045102S","chronDate":"16-17 Nov. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5374435","isNumber":"5397790","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5374435","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"5397790","articleId":"5397793","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5397796,"authors":[{"name":"Tuan Anh Vu","affiliation":["Department of Informatics, University of Oslo, Norway"],"firstName":"Tuan Anh","lastName":"Vu","id":"37528691700"},{"name":"Malihe Zarre Dooghabadi","affiliation":["Department of Informatics, University of Oslo, Norway"],"firstName":"Malihe Zarre","lastName":"Dooghabadi","id":"37542932500"},{"name":"Shanthi Sudalaiyandi","affiliation":["Department of Informatics, University of Oslo, Norway"],"firstName":"Shanthi","lastName":"Sudalaiyandi","id":"37542933200"},{"name":"H\u00e5kon A.

Two flavors of the architecture has been designed and evaluated in this article, one, a register based implementation for the buffer and the other using a random access memory (RAM). The tradeoff between the two is throughput versus area. The register based implementation is fast requiring only one clock cycle to complete the calculation (i.e a read, calculate and write back) for every incoming FTN symbol. However, it becomes prohibitive when systems with large number of sub-carriers (>64) is considered. The RAM based implementation provides a better solution in terms of area with slightly lower throughput. The mapper has been targetted for both FPGA (Xilinx Virtex-II Pro) and ASIC (130 nm standard cell CMOS) implementations. The design has been successfully tested on the FPGA and its output verified with the reference MATLAB model.","doi":"10.1109/NORCHP.2009.5397801","publicationTitle":"2009 NORCHIP","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 NORCHIP","pdfPath":"/iel5/5374435/5397790/05397801.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NORCHP.2009.5397801","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5397790","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hardware implementation of mapper for faster-than-Nyquist signaling transmitter","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5397801","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Hardware implementation of mapper for faster-than-Nyquist signaling transmitter","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-17 Nov. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5397801/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"16-17 Nov. 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2009","accessionNumber":"11134827","dateOfInsertion":"22 January 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5397801/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hardware implementation of mapper for faster-than-Nyquist signaling transmitter","confLoc":"Trondheim, Norway","sourcePdf":"8202.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064156S","chronDate":"16-17 Nov. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5374435","isNumber":"5397790","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5374435","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"5397790","articleId":"5397801","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5397810,"authors":[{"name":"Mehdi Taassori","affiliation":["Majlesi Branch, Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Islamic Azad University\uc2a0, Iran"],"firstName":"Mehdi","lastName":"Taassori","id":"38111142900"},{"name":"Mohsen Mossavi","affiliation":["Faculty of Engineering, Department of Electronic Engineering, Isfahan University, Iran"],"firstName":"Mohsen","lastName":"Mossavi","id":"38110818000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4310-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4311-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5397810","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":165},"abstract":"In this paper we present an adaptive compression technique that reduce the power consumption when compare to the compressed and original uncompressed data.

Basics and examples of the generalized rotation matrix are given. Algorithms for implementation of parametrical rotator are provided. Architectures of rotator are briefly described. Different rotator versions are compared by the number of operations. Rotator with serial input is recommended for the further development and mostly applications because of twice reduced number of adders and multipliers.

Mastering the linearity vs. efficiency trade-off is not trivial. Switch-mode power amplifiers can provide high power efficiency. However, they exhibit significant nonlinearities, which make them difficult to apply in modern high linear modulation wireless systems. In order to enable their use in such systems, a LUT-based predistortion technique targeting switch-mode PA linearization is introduced. Particularly the predistortion function derivation for handling the whole input interval of the nonlinearity predistortion is described. A 0.18\u00bfm CMOS Class F power amplifier is used as the study-case for testing and evaluating the proposed approach.

The presented data shows that it is possible to use these kind of advanced channel estimation strategies in wireless receivers, even though there has been no prior reports of these being implemented.","doi":"10.1109/NORCHP.2009.5397840","publicationTitle":"2009 NORCHIP","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 NORCHIP","pdfPath":"/iel5/5374435/5397790/05397840.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NORCHP.2009.5397840","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5397790","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hardware implementation of an SVD based MIMO OFDM channel estimator","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5397840","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Hardware implementation of an SVD based MIMO OFDM channel estimator","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-17 Nov. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5397840/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"16-17 Nov. 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2009","accessionNumber":"11089301","dateOfInsertion":"22 January 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5397840/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hardware implementation of an SVD based MIMO OFDM channel estimator","confLoc":"Trondheim, Norway","sourcePdf":"4003.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053521S","chronDate":"16-17 Nov. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5374435","isNumber":"5397790","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5374435","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5397790","articleId":"5397840","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5397841,"authors":[{"name":"Isael Diaz","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Information Technology, Lund University, Lund, Sweden"],"firstName":"Isael","lastName":"Diaz","id":"37529432900"},{"name":"Leif Wilhelmsson","affiliation":["Ericsson Research Limited, Finland"],"firstName":"Leif","lastName":"Wilhelmsson","id":"37294075300"},{"name":"Joachim Rodrigues","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Information Technology, Lund University, Lund, Sweden"],"firstName":"Joachim","lastName":"Rodrigues","id":"37270890900"},{"name":"Thomas Olsson","affiliation":["Ericsson Research Limited, Finland"],"firstName":"Thomas","lastName":"Olsson","id":"37267975600"},{"name":"Viktor \u00d6wall","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Information Technology, Lund University, Lund, Sweden"],"firstName":"Viktor","lastName":"\u00d6wall","id":"37271343400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4310-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4311-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5397841","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":143},"abstract":"This paper presents a hardware mapping of an auto-correlator for Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing stage for three radio standards: LTE, DVB-H, and IEEE 802.11n.

efficiency. Since the channel suffers the frequency selective fading, the received signal contains strong inter-symbol interference (ISI). To obtain the diversity- and code-gains, an iterative receiving algorithm is presented. By jointly using diversity combining, interference cancellation and soft decoding, the proposed iterative receiving algorithm properly decodes the information bits in the strong ISI environment. Consequently, all the subcarriers of FD-COFDM participate in diversity so that the system can achieve full frequency diversity in most practical channels. The new receiving algorithm is relatively simple compared to the maximum likelihood estimation algorithm, and is therefore a better alternative to balance the algorithm complexity and system performance.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Walsh-Hadamard coded spectral efficient full frequency diversity OFDM system","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2010.01.070605","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/5397885/05397891.pdf","startPage":"28","endPage":"34","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2010.01.070605","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5397885","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5397891","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5397891/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 January 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"January  2010","displayDocTitle":"A Walsh-Hadamard coded spectral efficient full frequency diversity OFDM system","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"58","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/5397891/","dateOfInsertion":"22 January 2010","publicationDate":"January 2010","accessionNumber":"11087659","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Walsh-Hadamard coded spectral efficient full frequency diversity OFDM system","sourcePdf":"028-tc1001-wang.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.072251S","chronDate":"January  2010","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"5397885","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"30","xplore-issue":"5397885","articleId":"5397891","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":5397893,"authors":[{"name":"Ugo Silva Dias","affiliation":["Wireless Technology Laboratory WissTek, Department of Communications, School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, State University of Campinas-UNICAMP, Sao Paulo, Brazil"],"firstName":"Ugo Silva","lastName":"Dias","id":"37541873800"},{"name":"Michel Daoud Yacoub","affiliation":["Wireless Technology Laboratory WissTek, Department of Communications, School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, State University of Campinas-UNICAMP, Sao Paulo, Brazil"],"firstName":"Michel Daoud","lastName":"Yacoub","id":"37272286500"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0090-6778"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-0857"}],"articleNumber":"5397893","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":20,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":524},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"abstract":"This paper derives an exact closed-form expression for the phase-envelope joint distribution of the \u03ba-\u03bc fading environment, a general fading model that includes the Rice and the Nakagami-m models as special cases.

It is assumed that both source and relay use equal allocated time in transmission. Depending on the quality of the source-relay channel, the relay may choose either Decode-and-Forward (DF), Amplify-and-Forward (AF), or Direct-Transmission (DT) to forward signals. It turns out that in terms of outage probability, two selection relaying schemes are better than others: selecting between DF and AF protocols (DF-AF) or selecting between DF and DT protocols (DF-DT). It is shown that with an equal power allocation, both of the DF-AF and DF-DT selection relaying protocols have the same asymptotic outage probability. However, with an optimum power allocation strategy, the DF-AF selection scheme is in general better than the DF-DT selection scheme. Note that the optimum power allocations depend on channel variances, not on instantaneous channel gains. When the quality of the relay-destination link is much better than that of the source-relay link, observed from simulation, the outage probability of the DF-AF selection protocol with its optimum power allocation is 1.5 dB better than that of the DF-DT selection with its own optimum power allocation. Extensive simulations are presented to validate the analytical results.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2010.01.060691","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/5397885/05397895.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2010.01.060691","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5397885","startPage":"52","endPage":"57","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On optimum selection relaying protocols in cooperative wireless networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5397895","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"On optimum selection relaying protocols in cooperative wireless networks","chronOrPublicationDate":"January  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5397895/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 January 2010","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"58","issue":"1","publicationDate":"January 2010","accessionNumber":"11074189","dateOfInsertion":"22 January 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5397895/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On optimum selection relaying protocols in cooperative wireless networks","sourcePdf":"052-tc1001-su.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.096301S","chronDate":"January  2010","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"5397885","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"46","xplore-issue":"5397885","articleId":"5397895","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-13"},{"_id":5397896,"authors":[{"name":"Ehsan Bayaki","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada"],"firstName":"Ehsan","lastName":"Bayaki","id":"37670153700"},{"name":"Robert Schober","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada"],"firstName":"Robert","lastName":"Schober","id":"37281221400"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0090-6778"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-0857"}],"articleNumber":"5397896","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":49,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":898},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5397896","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optical modulation","Fading","Intensity modulation","Gamma ray detection","Gamma ray detectors","Pairwise error probability","Space time codes","Photodetectors","Radio frequency","Analytical models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["atmospheric turbulence","intensity modulation","optical links","space-time codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["space-time coding","free-space optics communication","atmospheric turbulence","intensity modulation","direct detection","Gamma-Gamma fading","repetition coding"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Space-time coding, free-space optical systems","intensity modulation and direct detection, gamma-gamma fading","repetition coding"]}],"abstract":"Atmospheric turbulence-induced fading is one of the main impairments affecting free-space optics (FSO) communications.

The main advantage of this technique is that the diversity gain can be achieved without the need to install multiple antennas at the transmitter or the receiver. In this paper, we investigate the performance of the best-relay selection scheme where the \"best\" relay only participates in the relaying. Therefore, two channels only are needed in this case (one for the direct link and the other one for the best indirect link) regardless of the number of relays (M). The best relay is selected as the relay node that can achieve the highest signal-to-noise ratio at the destination node. A general mathematical probability model is developed to study the outage performance of the best-relay selection adaptive decode-and-forward cooperative networks. In particular, closed-form expressions for the outage probability and average channel capacity are derived. Results show that the best-relay selection not only reduces the amount of required resources but also can maintain a full diversity order.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2010.01.080080","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/5397885/05397898.pdf","startPage":"68","endPage":"72","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2010.01.080080","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5397885","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance analysis of adaptive decode-and-forward cooperative diversity networks with best-relay selection","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5397898","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 January 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"January  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5397898/","displayDocTitle":"Performance analysis of adaptive decode-and-forward cooperative diversity networks with best-relay selection","volume":"58","issue":"1","publicationDate":"January 2010","accessionNumber":"11087663","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5397898/","dateOfInsertion":"22 January 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance analysis of adaptive decode-and-forward cooperative diversity networks with best-relay selection","sourcePdf":"068-tc1001-ikki.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.074851S","chronDate":"January  2010","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"5397885","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"195","xplore-issue":"5397885","articleId":"5397898","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5397899,"authors":[{"name":"A.

It is further shown that the optimal scheduling scheme without quality of service constraints and the opportunistic scheduling schemes fall out as special cases of a more generalized class of scheduling schemes derived in this paper.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The effective capacity of a time division downlink scheduling system","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2010.01.080122","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/5397885/05397899.pdf","startPage":"73","endPage":"78","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2010.01.080122","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5397885","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5397899","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5397899/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 January 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"January  2010","displayDocTitle":"The effective capacity of a time division downlink scheduling system","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"58","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/5397899/","dateOfInsertion":"22 January 2010","publicationDate":"January 2010","accessionNumber":"11074191","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The effective capacity of a time division downlink scheduling system","sourcePdf":"073-tc1001-balasubramanian.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.12521S","chronDate":"January  2010","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"5397885","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"24","xplore-issue":"5397885","articleId":"5397899","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5397900,"authors":[{"name":"Ahmed Iyanda Sulyman","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, College of Engineering, King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia"],"firstName":"Ahmed Iyanda","lastName":"Sulyman","id":"37265095300"},{"name":"Mostafa Hefnawi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Royal Military College of Canada, Kingston, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Mostafa","lastName":"Hefnawi","id":"37284260800"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0090-6778"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-0857"}],"articleNumber":"5397900","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":14,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":890},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Array signal processing","Antenna arrays","Bit error rate","Error analysis","Closed-form solution","Channel capacity","Transmitting antennas","OFDM","Frequency division multiplexing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","MIMO systems","OFDM modulation","performance evaluation","space division multiple access"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["performance evaluation","capacity-aware MIMO beamforming schemes","OFDM-SDMA systems","symbol error rate","MIMO-MRC system"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["MIMO beamforming, OFDM-SDMA systems","capacity, symbol error rate (SER)"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents the symbol error rate (SER) performance of a capacity-aware adaptive MIMO beamforming scheme, which seeks iteratively, the beamforming weight vectors that enhance the capacity of OFDM-SDMA systems.

Such channels appear in many communication systems, e.g., orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing systems. When channel knowledge is available at both the transmitter and receiver, following the literature, we consider allotted LDPC codes which carefully assign different parts of the code to sub-channels. To reduce the number of design parameters and allow for efficient design, semi-regular allotted codes have been suggested. We first formulate the design of semi-regular codes as a mixed integer linear programming. Relaxing the semi-regularity constraint broadens the search space which results in improved codes and also a more efficient design via linear programming. While information theoretic results suggest that having channel state information-for a fixed power assignment-does not change the capacity, we show that under non-optimal decoding or when the maximum degree allowed in the code is small, allotted codes significantly outperform conventional ones. Finally, for the case that neither side has the channel knowledge (thus capacity-loss is inevitable), we see that the reduced capacity can still be approached by LDPC codes.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2010.01.060685","startPage":"101","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/5397885/05397904.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2010.01.060685","endPage":"109","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5397885","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"LDPC code design considerations for non-uniform channels","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5397904/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 January 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"January  2010","displayDocTitle":"LDPC code design considerations for non-uniform channels","volume":"58","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/5397904/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"11074192","dateOfInsertion":"22 January 2010","publicationDate":"January 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"LDPC code design considerations for non-uniform channels","sourcePdf":"101-tc1001-sanaei.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.059531S","chronDate":"January  2010","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"5397885","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"5397885","articleId":"5397904","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5397905,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaojun Yuan","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, City University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China","Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Hawaii, Manoa, HI, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/5397885/5397905/5397905-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Xiaojun Yuan (S'04-M'08) received the B.S. degree in electronic and information systems from Shanghai Jiaotong University, the M.S. degree in circuit and systems from Fudan University, and the Ph.D degree at City University of Hong Kong.

An important property of the proposed designs is the flexibility to select the number of constituent variable node degrees P. The proposed designs include existing systematic designs as a special case with P = N - 1, where N is the maximum variable node degree. Compared to the existing systematic designs, for a given rate and a given \u00bf > 0, the designed ensembles can have a threshold in \u00bf-neighborhood of the capacity upper bound with smaller values of P and N.

This paper studies the impact of removing these assumptions. We characterize the mean square error (MSE) of various linear channel estimation methods, and we derive analytical expressions for the BER performance. The derivations are kept generic so that they apply to both time-division and frequency-division multiplexing of the pilot signal and the data subcarriers. The analysis is specialized to the BER performance characterization of OFDM-based UWB systems for different realistic channel estimation methods with residual time and frequency errors. The effect of inter-carrier interference (ICI) on channel estimation is shown to be small. However, inter-symbol interference (ISI) severely impacts the quality of the channel estimates and hence can yield a large (>2 dB) data demodulation performance degradation.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Channel estimation","OFDM","Performance analysis","Bit error rate","Interference","Delay effects","Delay estimation","Frequency synchronization","Mean square error methods","Frequency division multiplexing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adjacent channel interference","channel estimation","error statistics","intersymbol interference","mean square error methods","OFDM modulation","ultra wideband communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","mean square error","BER performance","time-division multiplexing","frequency-division multiplexing","OFDM-based UWB system","inter-carrier interference","inter-symbol interference"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["OFDM, channel estimation, UWB, ICI, ISI"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5397909","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2010.01.070650","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/5397885/05397909.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2010.01.070650","startPage":"146","endPage":"156","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5397885","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Channel estimation for non-ideal OFDM systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Channel estimation for non-ideal OFDM systems","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5397909/","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"January  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 January 2010","volume":"58","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/5397909/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"22 January 2010","publicationDate":"January 2010","accessionNumber":"11087668","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Channel estimation for non-ideal OFDM systems","sourcePdf":"146-tc1001-montojo.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.086899S","chronDate":"January  2010","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"5397885","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"5397885","articleId":"5397909","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5397910,"authors":[{"name":"Rong Li","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, National University of Singapore, Singapore"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/5397885/5397910/5397910-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Rong Li received the B.

Each complex gain time-variation, within one OFDM symbol, is approximated by a polynomial representation. Based on the Jakes process, an auto-regressive (AR) model of the polynomial coefficients dynamics is built, making it possible to employ the Kalman filter estimator for the polynomial coefficients. Hence, the channel matrix is easily computed, and the data symbol is estimated with free inter-sub-carrier-interference (ICI) thanks to the use of a QR-decomposition of the channel matrix. Our claims are supported by theoretical analysis and simulation results, which are obtained considering Jakes' channels with high Doppler spreads.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2010.01.080296","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/5397885/05397911.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2010.01.080296","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5397885","startPage":"170","endPage":"178","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint data QR-detection and Kalman estimation for OFDM time-varying Rayleigh channel complex gains","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5397911","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Joint data QR-detection and Kalman estimation for OFDM time-varying Rayleigh channel complex gains","chronOrPublicationDate":"January  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5397911/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 January 2010","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"58","issue":"1","publicationDate":"January 2010","accessionNumber":"11074196","dateOfInsertion":"22 January 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5397911/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint data QR-detection and Kalman estimation for OFDM time-varying Rayleigh channel complex gains","sourcePdf":"170-tc1001-hijazi.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.076762S","chronDate":"January  2010","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"5397885","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"82","xplore-issue":"5397885","articleId":"5397911","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5397912,"authors":[{"name":"Young Gil Kim","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Seoul, Seoul, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/5397885/5397912/5397912-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Young Gil Kim received the B.Sc.

In previous works, the subscriber station (SS) feeds back the entire channel matrix to the base station (BS) and the BS designs its zero-forcing transmit beamformer and each user's receive beamformer, and feeds forward each user its respective receive beamformer. In this paper, each SS designs its receive beamformer using only its own channel and independent of the other user's channels and feeds back only a vector this framework is called non-collaborative. Assuming zero-forcing beamforming (ZFBF) with a single stream to each SS, we derive the optimal receive beamformer using the average SNR metric and determine the feedback vector based on this optimal receive beamformer. We show that the average receive SNR per user degrades linearly with increasing number of users assuming isotropically distributed MIMO channels and that the dominant right singular vector of the channel matrix is the optimal SS receive beamformer. This optimality holds even when the MIMO channels are correlated. Furthermore, we propose a receive beamformer design in the presence of external interference which can be caused due to aggressive time-frequency reuse in neighboring cells.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2010.01.070174","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/5397885/05397916.pdf","startPage":"218","endPage":"227","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2010.01.070174","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5397885","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal receive array beamforming for non-collaborative MIMO space division multiple access","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5397916","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 January 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"January  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5397916/","displayDocTitle":"Optimal receive array beamforming for non-collaborative MIMO space division multiple access","volume":"58","issue":"1","publicationDate":"January 2010","accessionNumber":"11087673","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5397916/","dateOfInsertion":"22 January 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal receive array beamforming for non-collaborative MIMO space division multiple access","sourcePdf":"218-tc1001-mundarath.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.08746S","chronDate":"January  2010","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"5397885","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5397885","articleId":"5397916","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5397918,"authors":[{"name":"Anh Tuan Hoang","affiliation":["Department of Modulation and Coding, Institute for Infocomm Research, Singapore"],"firstName":"Anh Tuan","lastName":"Hoang","id":"38187051700"},{"name":"Ying-Chang Liang","affiliation":["Department of Modulation and Coding, Institute for Infocomm Research, Singapore"],"firstName":"Ying-Chang","lastName":"Liang","id":"37275171800"},{"name":"Yonghong Zeng","affiliation":["Department of Modulation and Coding, Institute for Infocomm Research, Singapore"],"firstName":"Yonghong","lastName":"Zeng","id":"37271453200"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0090-6778"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-0857"}],"articleNumber":"5397918","dbTime":"35 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":72,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1206},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5397918","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Adaptive scheduling","Data communication","Cognitive radio","Chromium","Time-varying channels","Scheduling algorithm","Throughput","Communication system traffic control","Stochastic processes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive scheduling","adaptive signal processing","cognitive radio","data communication","queueing theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive joint scheduling","spectrum sensing","data transmission","cognitive radio networks","primary network","virtual sensing packet","standard queueing model"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Adaptive joint scheduling, spectrum sensing","data transmission, cognitive radio networks"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2010.01.070270","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/5397885/05397918.pdf","startPage":"235","endPage":"246","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2010.01.070270","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5397885","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive joint scheduling of spectrum sensing and data transmission in cognitive radio networks","abstract":"We consider a cognitive radio (CR) network that makes opportunistic use of a set of channels licensed to a primary network. During operation, the CR network is required to carry out spectrum sensing to detect active primary users, thereby avoiding interfering with them. However, spectrum sensing may cause negative effect on the performance of the CR network, as all CR communications has to be postponed during channel sensing. This paper focuses on adaptively scheduling spectrum sensing and data transmission so that negative impacts to the performance of the CR network are minimized. We first consider the case when CR nodes always have data to transmit and experience time-varying channels. Based on knowledge of channel conditions, the sensing periods are adaptively scheduled to maximize the spectrum efficiency of the CR operation. We show how optimal sensing/transmission scheduling policies can be obtained and prove some important structural properties of such optimal policies. We then consider the case when CR nodes experience both stochastic data arrival and time-varying channels. By treating each sensing period as a 'virtual sensing packet'', we convert the problem of joint spectrum-sensing/datatransmission scheduling into a standard queueing model. Based on that, an efficient scheduling algorithm that takes into account channel and queue conditions of the CR network is proposed.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"January  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5397918/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 January 2010","volume":"58","issue":"1","accessionNumber":"11074198","publicationDate":"January 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5397918/","dateOfInsertion":"22 January 2010","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive joint scheduling of spectrum sensing and data transmission in cognitive radio networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive joint scheduling of spectrum sensing and data transmission in cognitive radio networks","sourcePdf":"235-tc1001-hoang.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.086033S","chronDate":"January  2010","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"5397885","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"72","xplore-issue":"5397885","articleId":"5397918","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5397921,"authors":[{"name":"Yuan Shen","affiliation":["Laboratory for Information and Decision Systems LIDS, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/5397885/5397921/5397921-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yuan Shen (S'05) received his B.S. degree (with highest honor) from Tsinghua University, China, in 2005, and S.M. degree from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in 2008, both in electrical engineering.

Time-of-arrival (TOA) and angle-of-arrival (AOA) are the two most commonly used signal metrics for localizing nodes with unknown positions. In this paper, we consider a wireless network in which each node is equipped with a wideband antenna array capable of performing both TOA and AOA measurements. Since both the position and orientation of the agent are of interest, we propose a localization framework that jointly estimates these two parameters. The notion of equivalent fisher information is applied to derive the squared error bounds for the position and orientation. Since our analysis starts from the received waveforms rather than directly from the signal metrics, these bounds characterize the fundamental limits of the position and orientation accuracy. Surprisingly, our result reveals that AOA measurements obtained by wideband antenna arrays do not further improve position accuracy beyond that provided by TOA measurements.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2010.01.080141","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/5397885/05397921.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2010.01.080141","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5397885","startPage":"270","endPage":"280","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the accuracy of localization systems using wideband antenna arrays","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5397921","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"On the accuracy of localization systems using wideband antenna arrays","chronOrPublicationDate":"January  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5397921/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 January 2010","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"58","issue":"1","publicationDate":"January 2010","accessionNumber":"11087677","dateOfInsertion":"22 January 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5397921/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the accuracy of localization systems using wideband antenna arrays","sourcePdf":"270-tc1001-shen.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.094138S","chronDate":"January  2010","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"5397885","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"95","xplore-issue":"5397885","articleId":"5397921","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":5397922,"authors":[{"name":"Ketan Rajawat","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Minnesota, MN, USA","Department of Electrical Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur, India"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/5397885/5397922/5397922-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Ketan Rajawat (S'06) received his B.Tech.and M.Tech.degrees in Electrical Engineering from Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur in 2007.

It is known that the eigenvectors of the optimal input covariance matrix are the same as the eigen-vectors of the channel mean or covariance matrix. However, the optimal power allocation across the eigen-vectors is much less understood. In this paper, two scenarios are investigated: (1) Rician MIMO channels with mean channel feedback, and (2) Rayleigh MIMO channels with covariance channel feedback. We first derive a suboptimal power allocation algorithms in the spatial domain for expected mutual information maximization for two transmit antennas systems, based on an upper bound for the ergodic capacity of a MIMO channel with either channel mean or covariance information at the transmitter. Then, we extend heuristically the results to systems with multiple antennas at both the transmitter and receiver side. The proposed power allocation solution permits a closed-form expression and has a water-filling interpretation. Simulation results reveal that the proposed method performs nearly the same as the optimal solution (which requires highly complex optimization routines over random processes) with inappreciable difference.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/5397885/05397923.pdf","startPage":"289","endPage":"300","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2010.01.070377","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2010.01.070377","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5397885","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5397923","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Near-optimal power allocation for MIMO channels with mean or covariance feedback","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Feedback","Covariance matrix","Transmitting antennas","Transmitters","Fading","Rician channels","Mutual information","Upper bound","Receiving antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","MIMO communication","Rayleigh channels","Rician channels","statistical analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["near optimal power allocation","mean channel feedback","covariance channel feedback","covariance matrix","MIMO fading channel","eigen vectors","Rician channels","Rayleigh channels","ergodic capacity","closed form expression","water filling interpretation","optimization routines","random process"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Covariance, ergodic capacity, feedback, mean","MIMO, power allocation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5397923/","chronOrPublicationDate":"January  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 January 2010","displayDocTitle":"Near-optimal power allocation for MIMO channels with mean or covariance feedback","volume":"58","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/5397923/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"January 2010","accessionNumber":"11087679","dateOfInsertion":"22 January 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Near-optimal power allocation for MIMO channels with mean or covariance feedback","sourcePdf":"289-tc1001-li.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.121242S","chronDate":"January  2010","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"5397885","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"25","xplore-issue":"5397885","articleId":"5397923","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5397924,"authors":[{"name":"Jane Wei Huang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/5397885/5397924/5397924-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jane Wei Huang (S'07) received her bachelor's degree from Zhejiang University, China in 2005, and M.Phil. from Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong in 2007.

We assume that each secondary user can access the channel according to a decentralized predefined access rule based on the channel quality and the transmission delay of each secondary user. By modeling secondary user block fading channel qualities as a finite state Markov chain, we formulate the transmission rate adaptation problem of each secondary user as a general-sum Markovian dynamic game with a delay constraint. Conditions are given so that the Nash equilibrium transmission policy of each secondary user is a randomized mixture of pure threshold policies. Such threshold policies can be easily implemented. We then present a stochastic approximation algorithm that can adaptively estimate the Nash equilibrium policies and track such policies for non-stationary problems where the statistics of the channel and user parameters evolve with time.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2010.01.080157","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/5397885/05397924.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2010.01.080157","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5397885","startPage":"301","endPage":"310","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Transmission control in cognitive radio as a Markovian dynamic game: Structural result on randomized threshold policies","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5397924","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Transmission control in cognitive radio as a Markovian dynamic game: Structural result on randomized threshold policies","chronOrPublicationDate":"January  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5397924/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 January 2010","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"58","issue":"1","publicationDate":"January 2010","accessionNumber":"11087680","dateOfInsertion":"22 January 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5397924/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Transmission control in cognitive radio as a Markovian dynamic game: Structural result on randomized threshold policies","sourcePdf":"301-tc1001-huang.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.080754S","chronDate":"January  2010","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"5397885","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"34","xplore-issue":"5397885","articleId":"5397924","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5397942,"authors":[{"name":"K.

The circuit employs additional inhibitory and local excitory feedback based on a common voltage computation and this improves both speed and precision drastically. As a result, a single stage cell provides better resolution and speed in comparison to previous works. where cascading is necessary in to improve resolution. However in our previous work we observed resolution is 0.5mv and the circuit was functioning only for two cells, and also low dynamic range. Whereas the circuit described here is tested with 3 (three) contending cells and was giving better dynamic range and resolution. Simulations in Cadence show that a single cell can resolve voltage differences as small as 0.2mV in around 60-80ns in comparison to 100mV in and 0.5mV in. Detailed simulation results along with appropriate mathematical relations have been provided. This circuit is a fundamental building block in the competitive layer of self organizing neural networks, non linear filters, fuzzy and neuromorphic systems.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-15 Dec. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5397942/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11134675","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5397942/","publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"22 January 2010","conferenceDate":"14-15 Dec. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A 200\u00b5v resolution and high speed VLSI Winner-take-all circuit for self-organising neural network","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A 200\u00b5v resolution and high speed VLSI Winner-take-all circuit for self-organising neural network","confLoc":"New Delhi, India","sourcePdf":"57Ficm073.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04881S","chronDate":"14-15 Dec. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5379692","isNumber":"5397927","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5379692","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5397927","articleId":"5397942","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":5397970,"authors":[{"name":"Bapi Chatterjee","affiliation":["Department of Mathematics, Indian Institute of Technology Delhi, New Delhi, India"],"firstName":"Bapi","lastName":"Chatterjee","id":"38100019700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5051-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5397970","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":41,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":2855},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Nash equilibrium","Mathematical model","Optimization methods","Space technology","Quadratic programming","Software performance","Performance analysis","Constraint optimization","Approximation algorithms","Computer science"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["game theory","graphical user interfaces","mathematics computing","quadratic programming","software performance evaluation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["nonlinear optimization model formulation","Nash equilibrium computation","finite n-person non cooperative game","game strategies","zero optimal value","MATLAB","sequential quadratic programming","quasi Newton technique","GUI enabled software","software performance analysis"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Game theory","Nash equilibrium","n-person matrix game","nonlinear constrained optimization"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we consider a finite n-person non cooperative game.

Among them, this paper focuses on 3D IC partitioning, especially at the architectural level to maximize its benefits. We first derive logical formulations for 3D IC partitioning problems and then transform the formulations into integer linear programs (ILPs). The ILPs can minimize the footprint and the usage of vertical interconnects simultaneously. Our results conducted on the GSRC benchmark show that our approach outperforms the extended multi-way partitioning method in the usage of vertical interconnects under the same footprint settings. More importantly, our approach is very flexible and can readily extend to the partitioning problems with variant objectives and constraints, and with different abstract levels, e.g., from the architectural level down to the physical level. This flexibility makes the ILP formulations superior alternatives to the 3D IC partitioning problems.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International SOC Conference (SOCC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5379508/5397993/05398032.pdf","startPage":"321","endPage":"324","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International SOC Conference (SOCC)","doi":"10.1109/SOCCON.2009.5398032","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SOCCON.2009.5398032","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5397993","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5398032","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Generic integer linear programming formulation for 3D IC partitioning","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Integer linear programming","Three-dimensional integrated circuits","Through-silicon vias","Integrated circuit interconnections","LAN interconnection","Electronic design automation and methodology","Debugging","Logic devices","Iris","Design methodology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electronic design automation","integer programming","integrated circuit interconnections","integrated circuit layout","linear programming","three-dimensional integrated circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["3D integrated circuit partitioning","electronic design automation","vertical interconnects","GSRC floorplanning","generic integer linear programming","EDA","ILP"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5398032/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-11 Sept. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Generic integer linear programming formulation for 3D IC partitioning","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5398032/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"11134577","dateOfInsertion":"22 January 2010","conferenceDate":"9-11 Sept. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Generic integer linear programming formulation for 3D IC partitioning","confLoc":"Belfast, UK","sourcePdf":"074TB21.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042747S","chronDate":"9-11 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5379508","isNumber":"5397993","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5379508","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"5397993","articleId":"5398032","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5398041,"authors":[{"name":"Saeed Fouladi Fard","affiliation":["Ukalta Engineering, Edmonton, AB, Canada"],"firstName":"Saeed Fouladi","lastName":"Fard","id":"37569994800"},{"name":"Amirhossein Alimohammad","affiliation":["Ukalta Engineering, Edmonton, AB, Canada"],"firstName":"Amirhossein","lastName":"Alimohammad","id":"37295113600"},{"name":"Bruce Cockburn","affiliation":["University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB, Canada"],"firstName":"Bruce","lastName":"Cockburn","id":"37272651800"},{"name":"Christian Schlegel","affiliation":["University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB, Canada"],"firstName":"Christian","lastName":"Schlegel","id":"37275119900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4940-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4941-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2164-1676"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2164-1706"}],"articleNumber":"5398041","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":95},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fading","System-on-a-chip","MIMO","Wireless communication","Hardware","Acceleration","Transmitters","Measurement","Prototypes","Baseband"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fading channels","field programmable gate arrays","formal verification","MIMO communication","multipath channels","receivers","transmitters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO communication systems","versatile fading simulator","on-chip verification","data source","MIMO transmitter","MIMO receiver","multipath fading channel","data sink","baseband fading channel simulator","field programmable gate arrays"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we present a single-chip design for the accelerated verification of multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) wireless communication systems.

In contrast to early attempts of energy harvesting image sensor, we propose an asynchronous sensor in which the photodetector itself within the pixel can be used as an energy harvesting device, so that the total available energy will be increased. Low power operation is achieved since the time-to-first spike (TFS) pixel only fires once per frame. Utilizing address-event-representation, the imager can make efficient use of the output bandwidth. System architecture and operation are discussed together with the simulation results. Measurement results for a test structure fabricated in standard 0.35 \u00bfm CMOS process are also provided. A system model is developed to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A CMOS image sensor with reconfigurable resolution for energy harvesting applications","publicationTitle":"SENSORS, 2009 IEEE","doi":"10.1109/ICSENS.2009.5398193","displayPublicationTitle":"SENSORS, 2009 IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel5/5379507/5398121/05398193.pdf","startPage":"197","endPage":"200","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSENS.2009.5398193","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5398121","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5398193","pubTopics":[{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5398193/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-28 Oct. 2009","displayDocTitle":"A CMOS image sensor with reconfigurable resolution for energy harvesting applications","conferenceDate":"25-28 Oct. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5398193/","dateOfInsertion":"22 January 2010","publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","accessionNumber":"11134465","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A CMOS image sensor with reconfigurable resolution for energy harvesting applications","confLoc":"Christchurch, New Zealand","sourcePdf":"0445332.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.0406S","chronDate":"25-28 Oct. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5379507","isNumber":"5398121","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5379507","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5398121","articleId":"5398193","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5398195,"authors":[{"name":"Ph.

An array of four FBG strain sensors was tested experimentally and the maximum measurement error was 9.1 \u00bf\u00bf.","doi":"10.1109/ICSENS.2009.5398380","pdfPath":"/iel5/5379507/5398121/05398380.pdf","startPage":"1256","endPage":"1259","displayPublicationTitle":"SENSORS, 2009 IEEE","publicationTitle":"SENSORS, 2009 IEEE","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSENS.2009.5398380","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5398121","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improved spectral tag method for FBG sensor multiplexing with equally spaced spectral codes and simulated annealing algorithm","pubTopics":[{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5398380/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-28 Oct. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Improved spectral tag method for FBG sensor multiplexing with equally spaced spectral codes and simulated annealing algorithm","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"22 January 2010","accessionNumber":"11119229","publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5398380/","conferenceDate":"25-28 Oct. 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improved spectral tag method for FBG sensor multiplexing with equally spaced spectral codes and simulated annealing algorithm","confLoc":"Christchurch, New Zealand","sourcePdf":"2895840.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064934S","chronDate":"25-28 Oct. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5379507","isNumber":"5398121","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5379507","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5398121","articleId":"5398380","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5398420,"authors":[{"name":"Brian Dick","affiliation":["Advanced Circuits and Sensors Branch, Space and Naval Warfare System Center Pacific, San Diego, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Brian","lastName":"Dick","id":"37992579800"},{"name":"Mark Fralick","affiliation":["Advanced Circuits and Sensors Branch, Space and Naval Warfare System Center Pacific, San Diego, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Mark","lastName":"Fralick","id":"37992771400"},{"name":"Hugo Jazo","affiliation":["Advanced Circuits and Sensors Branch, Space and Naval Warfare System Center Pacific, San Diego, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Hugo","lastName":"Jazo","id":"37992880300"},{"name":"Maxwell Kerber","affiliation":["Advanced Circuits and Sensors Branch, Space and Naval Warfare System Center Pacific, San Diego, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Maxwell","lastName":"Kerber","id":"38014091000"},{"name":"Jerry Brewer","affiliation":["Advanced Circuits and Sensors Branch, Space and Naval Warfare System Center Pacific, San Diego, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Jerry","lastName":"Brewer","id":"38106212500"},{"name":"Richard Waters","affiliation":["Advanced Circuits and Sensors Branch, Space and Naval Warfare System Center Pacific, San Diego, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Richard","lastName":"Waters","id":"37992752600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4548-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-5335-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1930-0395"},{"format":"CD","value":"1930-0395"}],"articleNumber":"5398420","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":254},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Kinetic energy","Magnets","Coils","Wireless sensor networks","Design optimization","Acceleration","Springs","Magnetic fields","Solid modeling","Thermoelectricity"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electromagnetic devices","energy harvesting","iterative methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electromagnetic kinetic energy harvester optimization","low amplitude vibration","iterative design process","nonlinear device"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5398420","doi":"10.1109/ICSENS.2009.5398420","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSENS.2009.5398420","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5398121","publicationTitle":"SENSORS, 2009 IEEE","displayPublicationTitle":"SENSORS, 2009 IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel5/5379507/5398121/05398420.pdf","startPage":"1840","endPage":"1843","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimization of kinetic energy harvester for low amplitude vibration","abstract":"This paper presents the steps involved in optimizing the design of an electromagnetic kinetic energy harvester (KEH).

Recently, many researches reported that high dynamic range can be achieved through processing the image signals with ADCs or counters built inside the pixel, and some other methods require adjustable circuit block to maneuver photo-generated charges by a longer integration time. However, the inevitable consumption of power due to additional circuits alleviates the practicality. In this paper, a CMOS image sensor based on 3T active pixel sensor (APS) with 5.5 \u00bfm pixel pitch is investigated, successfully increasing DR without charging additional power by implementing a total of 4 sets of image arrays, of which 3 are new designs and one is typical type as control group. The arrays are 32 \u00d7 32 pixels, implemented in a 0.18 \u00bfm CMOS fabrication process, where photodiode has an n-well and p-substrate structure. Testing result is an increment of DR by estimated 7 to 18 dB among the experimental groups with no power consumption. The idea of in-pixel DR enhancement technique is verified, and one conclusion is made that in-pixel analog design is one direction for designers.","doi":"10.1109/ICSENS.2009.5398509","publicationTitle":"SENSORS, 2009 IEEE","displayPublicationTitle":"SENSORS, 2009 IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel5/5379507/5398121/05398509.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSENS.2009.5398509","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5398121","startPage":"1644","endPage":"1647","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A CMOS image sensor zero power dynamic range increasing technique","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5398509","pubTopics":[{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A CMOS image sensor zero power dynamic range increasing technique","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-28 Oct. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5398509/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"25-28 Oct. 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","accessionNumber":"11134524","dateOfInsertion":"22 January 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5398509/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A CMOS image sensor zero power dynamic range increasing technique","confLoc":"Christchurch, New Zealand","sourcePdf":"3765610.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060586S","chronDate":"25-28 Oct. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5379507","isNumber":"5398121","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5379507","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5398121","articleId":"5398509","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5398511,"authors":[{"name":"Shun Kawada","affiliation":["Graduate School of Engineering, University of Tohoku, Sendai, Japan"],"firstName":"Shun","lastName":"Kawada","id":"37395404600"},{"name":"Shin Sakai","affiliation":["Graduate School of Engineering, University of Tohoku, Sendai, Japan"],"firstName":"Shin","lastName":"Sakai","id":"37411486800"},{"name":"Nana Akahane","affiliation":["Graduate School of Engineering, University of Tohoku, Sendai, Japan"],"firstName":"Nana","lastName":"Akahane","id":"37296244800"},{"name":"Rihito Kuroda","affiliation":["Graduate School of Engineering, University of Tohoku, Sendai, Japan"],"firstName":"Rihito","lastName":"Kuroda","id":"37294742300"},{"name":"Shigetoshi Sugawa","affiliation":["Graduate School of Engineering, University of Tohoku, Sendai, Japan"],"firstName":"Shigetoshi","lastName":"Sugawa","id":"37284703100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4548-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-5335-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1930-0395"},{"format":"CD","value":"1930-0395"}],"articleNumber":"5398511","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":918},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Dynamic range","CMOS image sensors","Pixel","Optical filters","Reproducibility of results","Optical imaging","Infrared image sensors","Capacitors","Capacitance","Image sensors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["capacitors","CMOS image sensors","optical filters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["color reproducibility imaging","lateral overflow integration capacitor","infrared cut filter","WRGB LOFIC CMOS image sensor","wide dynamic range checkered-color CMOS image sensor","IR-cut RGB pixel","visible-to-near-IR pixels","noise figure 102 dB"]}],"abstract":"A single-chip wide dynamic range (DR) CMOS image sensor is demonstrated with good color reproducibility imaging for the visible wave band, as well as a high sensitivity for the wide waveband coverage through visible to near infrared (near-IR) wavebands.

The currently available analytical models of multi-layered IDCs are targeted to those fabricated by conventional semiconductor process. For this reason, we have adapted two promising models and assessed their accuracies by comparison with experimental data. We modified these models by treating the paper as non-infinite thick substrate and taking the effect of printed metal thickness into account. The models are studied further to reveal the relationship between the response of capacitance change and various geometric parameters which enables a quick way of obtaining the optimum IDC structure design. The modified Gevorgian model fits our experimental data best, and the sensitivity of IDCs is largely affected by its spatial wavelength and the thickness of sensing material layer, while the finger number, length and metallization ratio have minor impact.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"25-28 Oct. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5398531/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"11134533","publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","conferenceDate":"25-28 Oct. 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5398531/","dateOfInsertion":"22 January 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Development and experimental verification of analytical models for printable interdigital capacitor sensors on paperboard","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Development and experimental verification of analytical models for printable interdigital capacitor sensors on paperboard","confLoc":"Christchurch, New Zealand","sourcePdf":"2365821.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059675S","chronDate":"25-28 Oct. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5379507","isNumber":"5398121","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5379507","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"5398121","articleId":"5398531","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5398537,"authors":[{"name":"T.

It is shown that selection of the unit cell is very important and can highly influence the sensitivity. The shown principle is very powerful and can be scaled up to THz frequencies, only limited by available fabrication technology. A built planar differential microwave sensor based on artificial lines working at 2.3 GHz is presented. It features a simple output power evaluation instead of a classic but more complicated phase difference measurement. With power variation of up to 60 dB in dependence of small environmental dielectric changes it shows a very high sensitivity and dynamic range. Functional layer coatings can be applied easily due to its planarity and open wide application areas for biomedical sensing.","displayPublicationTitle":"SENSORS, 2009 IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel5/5379507/5398121/05398538.pdf","startPage":"755","endPage":"758","publicationTitle":"SENSORS, 2009 IEEE","doi":"10.1109/ICSENS.2009.5398538","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSENS.2009.5398538","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5398121","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5398538","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Artificial transmission lines for high sensitive microwave sensors","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Transmission lines","Microwave sensors","Power transmission lines","Capacitive sensors","Frequency","Fabrication","Power generation","Biomedical measurements","Dielectric measurements","Power measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["high-frequency transmission lines","microwave detectors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["artificial transmission lines","planar differential microwave","output power evaluation","functional layer coatings","capacitive sensors","small environmental dielectric changes","biomedical sensing","frequency 2.3 GHz"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5398538/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-28 Oct. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Artificial transmission lines for high sensitive microwave sensors","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5398538/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","accessionNumber":"11134550","dateOfInsertion":"22 January 2010","conferenceDate":"25-28 Oct. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Artificial transmission lines for high sensitive microwave sensors","confLoc":"Christchurch, New Zealand","sourcePdf":"1735532.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043578S","chronDate":"25-28 Oct. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5379507","isNumber":"5398121","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5379507","citationCount":"33","xplore-issue":"5398121","articleId":"5398538","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5398782,"authors":[{"name":"Marco Conti","affiliation":["Institute of the Italian National Research Council (CNR), IIT"],"bio":{"p":["Marco Conti is a research director at IIT, an institute of the Italian National Research Council (CNR).

The proposed schemes are based on tracking the output waveform of a composite PN-correlator (CPC), which provides sufficient correlative gains to detect its peaks even in the presence of large CFOs. From the correlation peaks, we can extract useful information for estimating the synchronization offsets. CFO is recovered by a multi-stage CPC scheme, of which the parameters are adjustable for meeting the system's demands on the tracking range and accuracy. According to the inter-frame variations of correlation waveform, we estimate SFO for a large scale and correct SFO through an interpolator. Meanwhile, frame timing is investigated in this paper, and the analysis indicates a very fast and robust timing scheme is possible for TDS-OFDM receiver. The developed synchronizer is quite robust against a large CFO even in very adverse fading channels, and it is shown by computer simulation that the residual synchronization error has little effect on the performance of TDS-OFDM receiver.","doi":"10.1109/TBC.2009.2039520","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Broadcasting","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Broadcasting","pdfPath":"/iel5/11/5419214/05398819.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TBC.2009.2039520","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5419214","startPage":"77","endPage":"85","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Composite PN-Correlation Based Synchronizer for TDS-OFDM Receiver","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5398819","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A Composite PN-Correlation Based Synchronizer for TDS-OFDM Receiver","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5398819/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 January 2010","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"56","issue":"1","publicationDate":"March 2010","accessionNumber":"11154884","dateOfInsertion":"22 February 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5398819/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Composite PN-Correlation Based Synchronizer for TDS-OFDM Receiver","sourcePdf":"tbc-liu-2039520.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.094159S","chronDate":"March  2010","xplore-pub-id":"11","isNumber":"5419214","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"11","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"5419214","articleId":"5398819","onlineDate":"26 January 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5398820,"authors":[{"name":"Tao Yang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology, Sichuan, China","Department of Electrical Engineering, University of California, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/22/5409964/5398820/5398820-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Tao Yang (S'09) received the B.

The circuit is a combination of a shunt resonant circuit and series resonant circuit. With this combination, lower resonant frequency is achieved as compared to the single shunt and series resonant circuits. As a result, a compact resonator with smaller size can be achieved as compared to the conventional quarter- and half-wave resonators. Besides the size reduction, the proposed resonant circuit is able to introduce a transmission zero to improve the stopband suppression in filter design. Based on this circuit, a very compact interdigital coupled microstrip resonator is proposed in this paper. The resonator achieves a small length of nearly 1/10 guided wavelength (\u00bf\n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">g</i>\n), which has a length reduction of 63% as compared to the conventional uniform quarter-wave resonator.

Both good performance and miniaturization are achieved for the proposed filters, and the expected transmission zeros are also observed.

The proposed scheme addresses both state and output faults by considering separate time profiles. The faults, which could be incipient or abrupt, are modeled using input and output signals of the system. The fault-detection (FD) scheme comprises online approximator in discrete time (OLAD) with a robust adaptive term. An output residual is generated by comparing the FD estimator output with that of the measured system output. A fault is detected when this output residual exceeds a predefined threshold. Upon detecting the fault, the robust adaptive terms and the OLADs are initiated wherein the OLAD approximates the unknown fault dynamics online while the robust adaptive terms help in ensuring asymptotic stability of the FD design. Using the OLAD outputs, a fault diagnosis scheme is introduced. A stable parameter update law is developed not only to tune the OLAD parameters but also to estimate the time to failure (TTF), which is considered as a first step for prognostics. The asymptotic stability of the FDP scheme enhances the detection and TTF accuracy. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated using a fourth-order MIMO satellite system.","doi":"10.1109/TNN.2009.2037498","startPage":"404","endPage":"423","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNN.2009.2037498","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5420315","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/72/5420315/05398833.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Model-Based Fault-Detection and Prediction Scheme for Nonlinear Multivariable Discrete-Time Systems With Asymptotic Stability Guarantees","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5398833/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A Model-Based Fault-Detection and Prediction Scheme for Nonlinear Multivariable Discrete-Time Systems With Asymptotic Stability Guarantees","volume":"21","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/5398833/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11151945","pubMedId":"20106734","publicationDate":"March 2010","dateOfInsertion":"25 February 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 January 2010","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Model-Based Fault-Detection and Prediction Scheme for Nonlinear Multivariable Discrete-Time Systems With Asymptotic Stability Guarantees","sourcePdf":"tnn-thumati-2037498.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.10779S","chronDate":"March  2010","xplore-pub-id":"72","isNumber":"5420315","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"72","citationCount":"66","xplore-issue":"5420315","articleId":"5398833","onlineDate":"26 January 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5398834,"authors":[{"name":"Radhakrishnan Nagarajan","affiliation":["Infinera Corporation, Sunnyvale, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/2944/5594752/5398834/5398834-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Radhakrishnan Nagarajan (S\u201985\u2013M\u201986\u2013SM\u201997\u2013F\u201908) obtained the B.Eng.

To improve the signal-to-noise ratio prior to the equalization process, three different techniques are proposed to blindly implement the multidimensional matched filtering. Different from the blind channel identification techniques for SIMO channels in the literature, the proposed techniques require neither the implementation inefficient matrix decomposition methods nor the higher-order statistics of the received data. Therefore, they are favorable over existing methods due to their simplicity in application. The matched filter equivalents are established through the use of an adaptive filter as well as the channel equalization being performed blindly. It has been shown that the equalization performance of the proposed methods are close to the matched filter bound, and to support this, a comparison between the matched filter estimation error performances of our proposed techniques is also provided. A short discussion to improve the convergence speed of the proposed approaches is also included in this paper.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 January 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5398837/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2010","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"59","issue":"5","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May 2010","dateOfInsertion":"05 April 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5398837/","accessionNumber":"11208298","displayDocTitle":"Blind Multidimensional Matched Filtering Techniques for Single Input Multiple Output Communications","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Blind Multidimensional Matched Filtering Techniques for Single Input Multiple Output Communications","sourcePdf":"tim-coskun-2038291.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.075181S","chronDate":"May  2010","xplore-pub-id":"19","isNumber":"5443470","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"19","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"5443470","articleId":"5398837","onlineDate":"26 January 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5398843,"authors":[{"name":"Olivier Kramer","affiliation":["D\u00e9partement de G\u00e9nie \u00c9lectrique, Poly Grames Research Center, \u00c9cole Polytechnique de Montr\u00e9al, Montreal, QUE, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8/5443538/5398843/5398843-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Olivier Kramer was born in Lyon, France, in 1984.

The classical Yagi-Uda antenna may be useful in meeting such demands, which however, becomes very large in size to achieve a high-gain performance due to a large number of directors as well as space required between those elements. In this paper, high-gain yet compact stacked multilayered Yagi antennas are proposed and demonstrated at 5.8 GHz for LPS applications. This structure makes use of vertically stacked Yagi-like parasitic director elements that allow easily obtaining a simulated gain of 12 dB. Two different antenna configurations are presented, one based on dipole geometry for single polarization, and the other on a circular patch to achieve dual polarization. The characteristics of these antennas with respect to various geometrical parameters are studied in order to obtain the desired performance. Measured results of the fabricated antenna prototypes are in good agreement with simulated results. The measured dipole Yagi antenna yields 11 dB gain over 14% bandwidth with a size of 80 \u00d7 80 \u00d7 29 mm\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">3</sup>\n.

The resulting expressions are very simple to interpret, completely general, explicit and without approximations in terms of the currents flowing on the device. They are also fast since they involve integrals solely over the device generating the field. The new technique is very feasible to be used in cases where the electric and magnetic reactive energies are important in practice, especially in the case of radiating structures. Used there, they allow to study the effect of the shape of the device on the amount of reactive energy, and thus on the Q of the device. The implementation of the new expressions in numerical CAD tools is extremely simple and straightforward.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel5/8/5443538/05398856.pdf","startPage":"1112","endPage":"1127","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","doi":"10.1109/TAP.2010.2041166","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.2010.2041166","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5443538","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5398856","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reactive Energies, Impedance, and - Factor of Radiating Structures","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Impedance","Magnetic separation","Electromagnetic fields","Shape","Bandwidth","Topology","Electromagnetic devices","Wire","Microwave antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna radiation patterns","electric impedance","electromagnetic devices","Q-factor"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["impedance","Q factor","radiating structure","electromagnetic field","electromagnetic device","electric reactive energy","magnetic reactive energy","numerical CAD tool"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Poynting theorem","${\\rm Q}$  factor","radiation","reactive energy"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5398856/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 January 2010","displayDocTitle":"Reactive Energies, Impedance, and <formula formulatype=\"inline\"> <tex Notation=\"TeX\">${\\rm Q}$</tex></formula> Factor of Radiating Structures","volume":"58","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/5398856/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2010","accessionNumber":"11208253","dateOfInsertion":"05 April 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reactive Energies, Impedance, and <formula formulatype=\"inline\"> <tex Notation=\"TeX\">${\\rm Q}$</tex></formula> Factor of Radiating Structures","sourcePdf":"tap-gvandenbosch-2041166.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.058043S","chronDate":"April  2010","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"5443538","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"129","xplore-issue":"5443538","articleId":"5398856","onlineDate":"26 January 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-27"},{"_id":5398858,"authors":[{"name":"Luigi Vallozzi","affiliation":["Information Technology Department INTEC, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8/5443538/5398858/5398858-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Luigi Vallozzi was born in Ortona, Italy, in 1980.

The proposed FSS consists of a two-dimensional periodic array of microstrip lines. For an incident wave of linear polarization perpendicular to the printed lines, virtual magnetic walls are formed between the microstrip lines. Since a microstrip line shielded with magnetic side walls supports two quasi-TEM modes, the two-dimensional array effectively forms a dual-mode resonator. The elliptic response is thus realized by coupling the incident wave to both modes of the resonator. A wideband pseudo-elliptic response is achieved by including higher-order modes of the array. To analyze this FSS, we treat it as a cascaded junction of air-to-microstrip line discontinuities, and investigate the problem using the full-wave mode-matching method. We provide useful design guidelines for both narrow-band and wide-band FSSs, while explaining the effect of various geometrical parameters on the performance of this FSS. Narrow-band and wideband FSS prototypes are fabricated and measured results validate our design concept. This new class of FSS is easy-to-assemble, exhibits a superior performance, and is thus potentially useful for many practical applications.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel5/8/5443538/05398862.pdf","startPage":"1220","endPage":"1226","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","doi":"10.1109/TAP.2010.2041167","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.2010.2041167","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5443538","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5398862","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Novel Band-Reject Frequency Selective Surface With Pseudo-Elliptic Response","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Frequency selective surfaces","Wideband","Microstrip antenna arrays","Magnetic shielding","Narrowband","Polarization","Microstrip resonators","Magnetic analysis","Mode matching methods","Guidelines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","frequency selective surfaces","microstrip discontinuities","periodic structures"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["band-reject frequency selective surface","pseudo-elliptic band-reject response","two-dimensional periodic array","microstrip lines","linear polarization","printed lines","virtual magnetic walls","magnetic side walls","dual mode resonator","incident wave","wideband pseudo-elliptic response","air-to-microstrip line discontinuities","full wave mode matching"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Band-reject response","dual-mode resonator","elliptic response","frequency selective surface","microstrip line shielded with magnetic side walls"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5398862/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 January 2010","displayDocTitle":"A Novel Band-Reject Frequency Selective Surface With Pseudo-Elliptic Response","volume":"58","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/5398862/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2010","accessionNumber":"11208228","dateOfInsertion":"05 April 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Novel Band-Reject Frequency Selective Surface With Pseudo-Elliptic Response","sourcePdf":"tap-zshen-2041167.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.051053S","chronDate":"April  2010","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"5443538","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"110","xplore-issue":"5443538","articleId":"5398862","onlineDate":"26 January 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5398863,"authors":[{"name":"Francesco Vacondio","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering Center for Optics Photonics and Lasers, Universit\u00e9 Laval, QUE, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/2944/5406274/5398863/5398863-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Francesco Vacondio was born on December 18, 1981 in Reggio Emilia, Italy.

The antenna provides broadside radiation. By using a solid rectangular dielectric resonator mounted on a vertical ground plane edge, the total antenna volume is considered to be less than that with a perpendicular ground plane. A wide impedance matching bandwidth is achieved. In addition, a modified version of the rectangular dielectric resonator antenna, which has two dielectric pieces removed to have an A-shaped resonator, provides wider impedance matching bandwidth of around 93% with much better broadside radiation characteristics and lighter weight is also considered. Comparison between the two antennas is presented with parametric study. The modified antenna is built and tested and very good agreement between computed and measured results is obtained.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.2010.2041160","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5443538","startPage":"1047","endPage":"1053","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel5/8/5443538/05398868.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Ultrawideband Dielectric Resonator Antenna With Broadside Patterns Mounted on a Vertical Ground Plane Edge","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5398868/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 January 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5398868/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Ultrawideband Dielectric Resonator Antenna With Broadside Patterns Mounted on a Vertical Ground Plane Edge","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2010","accessionNumber":"11208264","dateOfInsertion":"05 April 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"58","issue":"4","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Ultrawideband Dielectric Resonator Antenna With Broadside Patterns Mounted on a Vertical Ground Plane Edge","sourcePdf":"tap-sryu-2041160.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.053974S","chronDate":"April  2010","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"5443538","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"80","xplore-issue":"5443538","articleId":"5398868","onlineDate":"26 January 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5398869,"authors":[{"name":"Yakir Hadad","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, Beersheba, Israel"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8/5443538/5398869/5398869-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yakir Hadad was born in Beer Sheva, Israel, in 1984.

In this paper, we contribute two stochastic algorithms, the archiving molecular memetic algorithm (AMMA) and the archiving basin hopping algorithm (ABHA) for sampling low-energy isomers on the landscapes of pure water clusters (H\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sub>\nO)\n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">n</i>\n.

Our algorithms not only reproduced previously-found best minima, but also discovered new global minima candidates for sizes 9-15 on OSS2. Further numerical results show that AMMA and ABHA outperformed a baseline stochastic multistart local search algorithm in terms of convergence and isomer archival. Noting a performance differential between TTM2.1-F and OSS2, we analyzed both model landscapes to reveal that the global and local correlation properties of the empirical models differ significantly. In particular, the OSS2 landscape was less correlated and hence, more difficult to explore and optimize. Guided by our landscape analyses, we proposed and demonstrated the effectiveness of a hybrid local search algorithm, which significantly improved the sampling performance of AMMA on the larger OSS2 landscapes. Although applied to pure water clusters in this paper, AMMA and ABHA can be easily modified for subsequent studies in computational chemistry and biology. Moreover, the landscape analyses conducted in this paper can be replicated for other molecular systems to uncover landscape properties and provide insights to both physical chemists and evolutionary algorithmists.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5398873/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 January 2010","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11325643","volume":"14","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/5398873/","publicationDate":"June 2010","dateOfInsertion":"27 May 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Discovering Unique, Low-Energy Pure Water Isomers: Memetic Exploration, Optimization, and Landscape Analysis","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Discovering Unique, Low-Energy Pure Water Isomers: Memetic Exploration, Optimization, and Landscape Analysis","sourcePdf":"tevc-hsoh-2033584.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.127106S","chronDate":"June  2010","xplore-pub-id":"4235","isNumber":"5473158","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4235","citationCount":"30","xplore-issue":"5473158","articleId":"5398873","onlineDate":"26 January 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5398874,"authors":[{"name":"Woo-Tae Kim","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Yonsei University, Seoul, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8/5443538/5398874/5398874-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Woo-Tae Kim was born in Seoul, Korea.

The difference equations approximate the spatial derivatives in Maxwell's equation using more spatial sampling points distributed in an isotropic manner. The final spatial difference equation is a weighted summation of the two new difference and the conventional central difference equations. Therefore, based on the proposed spatial difference equation and choices of the weighting factors, seven different FDTD schemes can be formulated, which include the Yee scheme. Among the seven schemes, three methods can show isotropy of the dispersion superior to that of the Yee scheme. The weighting factors for the three schemes are numerically determined to minimize the anisotropy of the dispersion by using an optimization technique. In this paper, the dispersion & stability characteristics and the numerical complexity of the three ID-FDTD schemes are addressed. Also, the upper bound of the Courant number of the three ID-FDTD schemes is heuristically proposed and numerically verified. One scattering problem is considered to show the improved accuracy of the proposed ID-FDTD scheme.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel5/8/5443538/05398874.pdf","startPage":"1251","endPage":"1259","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","doi":"10.1109/TAP.2010.2041311","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.2010.2041311","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5443538","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5398874","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"3D Isotropic Dispersion (ID)-FDTD Algorithm: Update Equation and Characteristics Analysis","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Algorithm design and analysis","Difference equations","Maxwell equations","Time domain analysis","Sampling methods","Finite difference methods","Anisotropic magnetoresistance","Stability","Upper bound","Scattering"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["finite difference time-domain analysis","Maxwell equations","optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["3D isotropic dispersion-FDTD algorithm","update equation","characteristics analysis","3D isotropic dispersion-finite-difference time-domain algorithm","spatial difference equations","Maxwell equation","spatial sampling points","central difference equation","Yee scheme","weighting factors","optimization technique","stability characteristics"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) methods","isotropic dispersion","stability analysis"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5398874/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 January 2010","displayDocTitle":"3D Isotropic Dispersion (ID)-FDTD Algorithm: Update Equation and Characteristics Analysis","volume":"58","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/5398874/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2010","accessionNumber":"11208252","dateOfInsertion":"05 April 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"3D Isotropic Dispersion (ID)-FDTD Algorithm: Update Equation and Characteristics Analysis","sourcePdf":"tap-ikoh-2041311.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.069648S","chronDate":"April  2010","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"5443538","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"5443538","articleId":"5398874","onlineDate":"26 January 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5398878,"authors":[{"name":"Andrea Chimenton","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Ingegneria, Universit\u00e0 di Ferrara, Ferrara, Italy"],"firstName":"Andrea","lastName":"Chimenton","id":"37282750300"},{"name":"Cristian Zambelli","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Ingegneria, Universit\u00e0 di Ferrara, Ferrara, Italy"],"firstName":"Cristian","lastName":"Zambelli","id":"37397410700"},{"name":"Piero Olivo","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Ingegneria, Universit\u00e0 di Ferrara, Ferrara, Italy"],"firstName":"Piero","lastName":"Olivo","id":"37282751100"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0741-3106"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-0563"}],"articleNumber":"5398878","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":10,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":287},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Electron Devices Society","url":"http://www.ieee.org/eds/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Analytical models","Phase change memory","Phase change materials","Crystallization","Voltage","Physics","Semiconductor device measurement","Statistical analysis","Nonvolatile memory","Conductivity"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["phase change memories","statistical analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["erasing operation","phase-change memories","filamentation picture","electronic switching process","statistical analysis"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Compact modeling","erase operation","nonvolatile memory","phase-change memory (PCM)"]}],"abstract":"In this letter, we present a new analytical model of the erasing operation in phase-change memories (PCMs).

The generalized stability criterion is applicable for all 3-D FDTD schemes, such as time-average (TA), time-forward (TF), time-backward (TB) and exponential time differencing (ETD). It is reducible to either electrically lossy, magnetically lossy or lossless media. The stability criterion for perfectly matched layer (PML) matching condition can also be obtained as a special case to the doubly lossy media. It is shown that, for doubly lossy media, the stability criterion for ETD and TF becomes even more relaxed, and for TB, even more stringent compared to either electrically lossy, magnetically lossy or lossless media. On the other hand, the stability criterion for TA remains unchanged even in doubly lossy media. As numerical demonstration, the tunneling of electromagnetic wave through a very thin doubly lossy conductor is simulated. Numerical experiments further show the maximum allowed time step as dictated by the derived stability criterion for different schemes.","doi":"10.1109/TAP.2010.2041175","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel5/8/5443538/05398881.pdf","startPage":"1421","endPage":"1425","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.2010.2041175","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5443538","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Generalized Stability Criterion of 3-D FDTD Schemes for Doubly Lossy Media","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5398881","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 January 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5398881/","displayDocTitle":"Generalized Stability Criterion of 3-D FDTD Schemes for Doubly Lossy Media","volume":"58","issue":"4","publicationDate":"April 2010","accessionNumber":"11208259","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5398881/","dateOfInsertion":"05 April 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Generalized Stability Criterion of 3-D FDTD Schemes for Doubly Lossy Media","sourcePdf":"tap-dheh-2041175.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.088961S","chronDate":"April  2010","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"5443538","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5443538","articleId":"5398881","onlineDate":"26 January 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5398884,"authors":[{"name":"Jim Wang","affiliation":["Lockheed Martin Space Systems Company, Newtown, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Jim","lastName":"Wang","id":"37539003500"},{"name":"Sudhakar K.

Scanning circular arrays that use a single microphone to acquire measurements at a range of spatial sampling positions have been employed to gather an entire array data. Uniform sampling along the circle is typically used, but this scheme may not allow experimental flexibility. If, for any reason, the experiment was not completed in full, the data gathered may not be sufficient to perform the required processing. This paper presents an alternative spatial sampling scheme for scanning circular microphone arrays, which is more robust against uncertainty in the duration of the experiment. The proposed spatial sampling method is based on fixed-angle steps along the circle defined by the golden-ratio. Theoretical analysis of the golden-ratio sampling method is presented, supported by simulation examples, showing that experimental flexibility is achieved, but at the expanse of some reduction in numerical robustness.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5398886/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 January 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5398886/","dateOfInsertion":"07 September 2010","publicationDate":"Nov. 2010","accessionNumber":"11513408","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"18","issue":"8","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Golden-Ratio Sampling for Scanning Circular Microphone Arrays","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Golden-Ratio Sampling for Scanning Circular Microphone Arrays","sourcePdf":"18tasl05-brafaely-2041117-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.056546S","chronDate":"Nov.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"10376","isNumber":"5559658","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10376","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5559658","articleId":"5398886","onlineDate":"26 January 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":5398887,"authors":[{"name":"Ruiyuan Tian","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Information Technology, Lund University, Lund, Sweden"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8/5443538/5398887/5398887-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Ruiyuan Tian (S'07) received the Bachelor's degree in electronic engineering from Beijing Institute of Technology (BIT), China, in 2005, and the M.S. degree in digital communications from Chalmers University of Technology, Sweden, in 2007.

However, the compactness of terminal devices limits the number of spatial degrees of freedom (DOFs) in such systems, which motivates efficient antenna design techniques to exploit all available DOFs. In this contribution, we present a compact six-port dielectric resonator antenna (DRA) array which utilizes spatial, polarization and angle diversities. To evaluate the proposed DRA array, a measurement campaign was conducted at 2.65 GHz in indoor office scenarios for four 6 \u00d7 6 multiple antenna systems. Compared to the reference system of monopole arrays which only exploit spatial diversity, the use of dual-polarized patch antennas at the transmitter enriches the channel's DOF in the non-line-of-sight scenario. Replacing the monopole array at the receiver with the DRA array that has a 95% smaller ground plane, the 10% outage capacity evaluated at 10 dB reference signal-to-noise ratio becomes equivalent to that of the reference system, due to the DRA's rich diversity characteristics. In the line-of-sight scenario, the DRA array gives a higher DOF than the monopole array as the receive counterpart to the transmit patch array. However, the outage capacity is 1.5 bits/s/Hz lower, due to the DRA array's lower channel gain.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Compact Six-Port Dielectric Resonator Antenna Array: MIMO Channel Measurements and Performance Analysis","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","doi":"10.1109/TAP.2010.2041174","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel5/8/5443538/05398887.pdf","startPage":"1369","endPage":"1379","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.2010.2041174","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5443538","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5398887","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5398887/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 January 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2010","displayDocTitle":"A Compact Six-Port Dielectric Resonator Antenna Array: MIMO Channel Measurements and Performance Analysis","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"58","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/5398887/","dateOfInsertion":"05 April 2010","publicationDate":"April 2010","accessionNumber":"11208239","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Compact Six-Port Dielectric Resonator Antenna Array: MIMO Channel Measurements and Performance Analysis","sourcePdf":"tap-tian-2041174.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.088494S","chronDate":"April  2010","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"5443538","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"38","xplore-issue":"5443538","articleId":"5398887","onlineDate":"26 January 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5398889,"authors":[{"name":"Guoning Hu","affiliation":["Ohio State Uinversity, Columbus, OH, USA"],"firstName":"Guoning","lastName":"Hu","id":"37272827500"},{"name":"DeLiang Wang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering and Center of Cognitive Science, Ohio State Uinversity, Columbus, OH, USA"],"firstName":"DeLiang","lastName":"Wang","id":"37077285500"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1558-7916"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-7924"}],"articleNumber":"5398889","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":111,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1089},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.signalprocessingsociety.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Iterative algorithms","Speech analysis","Interference","Image analysis","Auditory system","Noise robustness","Automatic speech recognition","Speech enhancement","Performance evaluation","Background noise"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["iterative methods","speech processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["tandem algorithm","pitch estimation","voiced speech segregation","computational auditory scene analysis","monaural mixtures","target utterance","temporal continuity","pitch determination","pitch extraction","iterative procesure"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Computational auditory scene analysis (CASA)","iterative procedure","pitch estimation","speech segregation","tandem algorithm"]}],"abstract":"A lot of effort has been made in computational auditory scene analysis (CASA) to segregate speech from monaural mixtures. The performance of current CASA systems on voiced speech segregation is limited by lacking a robust algorithm for pitch estimation. We propose a tandem algorithm that performs pitch estimation of a target utterance and segregation of voiced portions of target speech jointly and iteratively. This algorithm first obtains a rough estimate of target pitch, and then uses this estimate to segregate target speech using harmonicity and temporal continuity. It then improves both pitch estimation and voiced speech segregation iteratively. Novel methods are proposed for performing segregation with a given pitch estimate and pitch determination with given segregation. Systematic evaluation shows that the tandem algorithm extracts a majority of target speech without including much interference, and it performs substantially better than previous systems for either pitch extraction or voiced speech segregation.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Tandem Algorithm for Pitch Estimation and Voiced Speech Segregation","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","doi":"10.1109/TASL.2010.2041110","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/10376/5559658/05398889.pdf","startPage":"2067","endPage":"2079","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TASL.2010.2041110","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5559658","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5398889","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5398889/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 January 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2010","displayDocTitle":"A Tandem Algorithm for Pitch Estimation and Voiced Speech Segregation","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"18","issue":"8","dateOfInsertion":"07 September 2010","publicationDate":"Nov. 2010","accessionNumber":"11513412","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Tandem Algorithm for Pitch Estimation and Voiced Speech Segregation","sourcePdf":"18tasl05-dwang-2041110-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.04044S","chronDate":"Nov.  2010","isNumber":"5559658","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10376","citationCount":"111","articleId":"5398889","onlineDate":"26 January 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-20"},{"_id":5398890,"authors":[{"name":"Giorgio Carluccio","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering, University of Sienna, Siena, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8/5443538/5398890/5398890-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Giorgio Carluccio was born in 1979 and grew up in Ortelle, Lecce, Italy.

This paper focuses on the development of an algorithm that can be optimized for a specific acoustic environment and improve speech intelligibility. The proposed method decomposes the input signal into time-frequency (T-F) units and makes binary decisions, based on a Bayesian classifier, as to whether each T-F unit is dominated by the target signal or the noise masker. Target-dominated T-F units are retained while masker-dominated T-F units are discarded. The Bayesian classifier is trained for each acoustic environment using an incremental approach that continuously updates the model parameters as more data become available. Listening experiments were conducted to assess the intelligibility of speech synthesized using the incrementally adapted models as a function of the number of training sentences. Results indicated substantial improvements in intelligibility (over 60% in babble at -5 dB SNR) with as few as ten training sentences in babble and at least 80 sentences in other noisy conditions.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5398891/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 January 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5398891/","dateOfInsertion":"07 September 2010","publicationDate":"Nov. 2010","accessionNumber":"11513406","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"18","issue":"8","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Improving Speech Intelligibility in Noise Using Environment-Optimized Algorithms","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improving Speech Intelligibility in Noise Using Environment-Optimized Algorithms","sourcePdf":"18tasl05-ploizou-2041116-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.140424S","chronDate":"Nov.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"10376","isNumber":"5559658","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10376","citationCount":"37","xplore-issue":"5559658","articleId":"5398891","onlineDate":"26 January 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-06"},{"_id":5398893,"authors":[{"name":"Eng Hock Lim","affiliation":["Faculty of Engineering and Science, Universiti Tunku Abdul Rahman, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8/5443538/5398893/5398893-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Eng Hock Lim (S'05\u2013M'08) was born in Selangor, Malaysia.

For demonstration, a dual function transparent hemispherical DRA made of Borosilicate Crown glass (Pyrex) is investigated. The dual function DRA simultaneously works as an antenna and a focusing lens for an underlaid solar cell. The system is very compact because no extra footprint is needed for the solar cell. A conformal strip is used to excite the hemispherical DRA in its fundamental broadside TE\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">111</sub>\n mode. Due to the focusing effect of the DRA, higher voltage and current outputs of the solar cell can be obtained. In this paper, the transparent rectangular DRA was also studied, and it was found that the rectangular DRA does not provide the focusing function. It was also found that the proposed transparent DRAs can provide a higher gain ( ~ 4 dBi) than for the state-of-the-art transparent microstrip antennas ( ~ -5 dBi to 0 dBi). The reflection coefficients, input impedances, antenna gains, and radiation patterns of the two transparent DRAs are studied, and reasonable agreement between the simulated and measured results was observed. The proposed configurations can potentially be used for applications that need a self-sustaining power.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel5/8/5443538/05398893.pdf","startPage":"1054","endPage":"1059","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","doi":"10.1109/TAP.2010.2041315","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.2010.2041315","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5443538","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5398893","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Transparent Dielectric Resonator Antennas for Optical Applications","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Dielectric resonator antennas","Optical resonators","Photovoltaic cells","Microstrip antennas","Glass","Lenses","Tellurium","Voltage","Optical reflection","Impedance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna radiation patterns","dielectric resonator antennas","lenses","optical communication","optical focusing","solar cells"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["transparent dielectric resonator antennas","dual function transparent hemispherical DRA","borosilicate crown glass","Pyrex","underlaid solar cell","focusing lens","conformal strip","broadside TE111 mode","reflection coefficients","input impedances","antenna gains","antenna radiation patterns","transparent microstrip antennas"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Dielectric resonator antennas (DRAs)","optical components","solar energy"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5398893/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 January 2010","displayDocTitle":"Transparent Dielectric Resonator Antennas for Optical Applications","volume":"58","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/5398893/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2010","accessionNumber":"11220578","dateOfInsertion":"05 April 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Transparent Dielectric Resonator Antennas for Optical Applications","sourcePdf":"tap-kleung-2041315.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.068617S","chronDate":"April  2010","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"5443538","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"46","xplore-issue":"5443538","articleId":"5398893","onlineDate":"26 January 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5398902,"authors":[{"name":"Prakash P.

Given the low spatial resolution test image and a database consisting of low and high spatial resolution images, we obtain super-resolution for the test image. We first obtain an initial high-resolution (HR) estimate by learning the high-frequency details from the available database. A new discrete wavelet transform (DWT) based approach is proposed for learning that uses a set of low-resolution (LR) images and their corresponding HR versions. Since the super-resolution is an ill-posed problem, we obtain the final solution using a regularization framework. The LR image is modeled as the aliased and noisy version of the corresponding HR image, and the aliasing matrix entries are estimated using the test image and the initial HR estimate. The prior model for the super-resolved image is chosen as an Inhomogeneous Gaussian Markov random field (IGMRF) and the model parameters are estimated using the same initial HR estimate. A maximum \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">a posteriori</i>\n (MAP) estimation is used to arrive at the cost function which is minimized using a simple gradient descent approach. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach by conducting the experiments on gray scale as well as on color images. The method is compared with the standard interpolation technique and also with existing learning-based approaches. The proposed approach can be used in applications such as wildlife sensor networks, remote surveillance where the memory, the transmission bandwidth, and the camera cost are the main constraints.","doi":"10.1109/TIP.2010.2041408","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/83/5447576/05398902.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIP.2010.2041408","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5447576","startPage":"1201","endPage":"1213","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"New Learning Based Super-Resolution: Use of DWT and IGMRF Prior","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5398902","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"New Learning Based Super-Resolution: Use of DWT and IGMRF Prior","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5398902/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 January 2010","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"19","issue":"5","publicationDate":"May 2010","accessionNumber":"11243500","pubMedId":"20106738","dateOfInsertion":"15 April 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5398902/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"New Learning Based Super-Resolution: Use of DWT and IGMRF Prior","sourcePdf":"19tip05-pgajjar-2041408.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.08053S","chronDate":"May  2010","xplore-pub-id":"83","isNumber":"5447576","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"74","xplore-issue":"5447576","articleId":"5398902","onlineDate":"26 January 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5398903,"authors":[{"name":"W.

However, only a few approaches utilize phase feature and they usually perform worse than those using magnitude feature. To investigate the potential of Gabor phase and its fusion with magnitude for face recognition, in this paper, we first propose local Gabor XOR patterns (LGXP), which encodes the Gabor phase by using the local XOR pattern (LXP) operator. Then, we introduce block-based Fisher's linear discriminant (BFLD) to reduce the dimensionality of the proposed descriptor and at the same time enhance its discriminative power. Finally, by using BFLD, we fuse local patterns of Gabor magnitude and phase for face recognition. We evaluate our approach on FERET and FRGC 2.0 databases. In particular, we perform comparative experimental studies of different local Gabor patterns. We also make a detailed comparison of their combinations with BFLD, as well as the fusion of different descriptors by using BFLD. Extensive experimental results verify the effectiveness of our LGXP descriptor and also show that our fusion approach outperforms most of the state-of-the-art approaches.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fusing Local Patterns of Gabor Magnitude and Phase for Face Recognition","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","doi":"10.1109/TIP.2010.2041397","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/83/5447576/05398909.pdf","startPage":"1349","endPage":"1361","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIP.2010.2041397","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5447576","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5398909","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5398909/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 January 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2010","displayDocTitle":"Fusing Local Patterns of Gabor Magnitude and Phase for Face Recognition","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"19","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/5398909/","dateOfInsertion":"15 April 2010","publicationDate":"May 2010","accessionNumber":"11243501","pubMedId":"20106741","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fusing Local Patterns of Gabor Magnitude and Phase for Face Recognition","sourcePdf":"tip-xie-2041397.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.14224S","chronDate":"May  2010","xplore-pub-id":"83","isNumber":"5447576","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"247","xplore-issue":"5447576","articleId":"5398909","onlineDate":"26 January 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5398911,"authors":[{"name":"Michele Cossalter","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Elettronica e Informazione, Politecnico di Milano, Milan, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6046/5430982/5398911/5398911-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Michele Cossalter was born in Oggiono, Italy, in 1984.

This has a negative impact in terms of consumed resources, as most of the raw information captured by conventional acquisition devices is discarded in the coding phase, while the analysis step only requires a few descriptors of salient video characteristics. Recent compressive sensing literature has partially broken this paradigm by proposing to integrate sensing and coding in a unified architecture composed by a light encoder and a more complex decoder, which exploits sparsity of the underlying signal for efficient recovery. However, a clear understanding of how to embed video analysis in this scheme is still missing. In this paper, we propose a joint compressive video coding and analysis scheme and, as a specific application example, we consider the problem of object tracking in video sequences. We show that, weaving together compressive sensing and the information computed by the analysis module, the bit-rate required to perform reconstruction and tracking of the foreground objects can be considerably reduced, with respect to a conventional disjoint approach that postpones the analysis after the video signal is recovered in the pixel domain. These findings suggest that considerable gains in performance can be potentially obtained in video analysis applications, provided that a joint analysis-aware design of acquisition, coding and signal recovery is carried out.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Multimedia","pdfPath":"/iel5/6046/5430982/05398911.pdf","startPage":"168","endPage":"183","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Multimedia","doi":"10.1109/TMM.2010.2041105","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMM.2010.2041105","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5430982","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5398911","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint Compressive Video Coding and Analysis","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Video coding","Video compression","Signal analysis","Performance analysis","Information analysis","Design optimization","Decoding","Video sequences","Weaving","Performance gain"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data compression","image sequences","video coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compressive video coding","video analysis","video acquisition","consumed resources","salient video characteristics","light encoder","complex decoder","object tracking","video sequences","video signal","analysis-aware design","signal recovery"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Compressive sensing","video coding and analysis"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5398911/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 January 2010","displayDocTitle":"Joint Compressive Video Coding and Analysis","volume":"12","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/5398911/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2010","accessionNumber":"11171988","dateOfInsertion":"15 March 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint Compressive Video Coding and Analysis","sourcePdf":"12tmm03-mtagliasacchi-2041105.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.07559S","chronDate":"April  2010","xplore-pub-id":"6046","isNumber":"5430982","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6046","citationCount":"34","xplore-issue":"5430982","articleId":"5398911","onlineDate":"26 January 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5398914,"authors":[{"name":"Alejandro G.

Because of their high selectivity, their performance is very dependent on the accuracy of the resonant frequency. An exhaustive study about different discrete-time implementations is contributed in this paper. Some methods, such as the popular ones based on two integrators, cause that the resonant peaks differ from expected. Such inaccuracies result in significant loss of performance, especially for tracking high-frequency signals, since infinite gain at the expected frequency is not achieved, and therefore, zero steady-state error is not assured. Other discretization techniques are demonstrated to be more reliable. The effect on zeros is also analyzed, establishing the influence of each method on the stability. Finally, the study is extended to the discretization of the schemes with delay compensation, which is also proved to be of great importance in relation with their performance. A single-phase active power filter laboratory prototype has been implemented and tested. Experimental results provide a real-time comparison among discretization strategies, which validate the theoretical analysis. The optimum discrete-time implementation alternatives are assessed and summarized.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/63/5491380/05398914.pdf","startPage":"1692","endPage":"1712","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2010.2041256","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2010.2041256","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5491380","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5398914","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Effects of Discretization Methods on the Performance of Resonant Controllers","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Resonance","Resonant frequency","Performance loss","Performance gain","Steady-state","Stability analysis","Delay","Active filters","Laboratories","Prototypes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["controllers","discrete time systems","resonant power convertors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["resonant controllers","zero steady-state error","discretization techniques","delay compensation","single-phase active power filter","optimum discrete time implementation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Current control","digital control","power conditioning","pulsewidth-modulated power converters","Z transforms"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5398914/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 January 2010","displayDocTitle":"Effects of Discretization Methods on the Performance of Resonant Controllers","volume":"25","issue":"7","htmlLink":"/document/5398914/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2010","accessionNumber":"11373799","dateOfInsertion":"21 June 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Effects of Discretization Methods on the Performance of Resonant Controllers","sourcePdf":"tpel-yepes-2041256.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.136705S","chronDate":"July  2010","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"5491380","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"397","xplore-issue":"5491380","articleId":"5398914","onlineDate":"26 January 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5398915,"authors":[{"name":"Wang-Q Lim","affiliation":["Institute of Mathematics, University of Osnabr\u00fcck, Osnabrueck, Germany"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/83/5447576/5398915/5398915-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Wang-Q Lim was born in Seoul, Korea, in 1973.

The controller design specifically takes probabilistic interval distribution of the communication delay into account. A general framework of networked control is first proposed. The two main features are 1) the zero-order hold can choose the latest control input signal when the packets received are out-of-order, and 2) as the result of 1), the models of the all kinds of uncertainties in networked signal transfer-including network-induced delay and data packet dropout-are under a unified framework. Next, if the probability distribution of communication delay is known or specified in a design process, sufficient stability conditions for networked T-S fuzzy systems are derived, which are based on the Lyapunov theory. Following this, a stabilizing controller design method is developed, which shows that the solvability of the design depends not only on the upper and lower bounds of the delay but on its probability distribution as well. Finally, a numerical example is used to show the application of the theoretical results obtained in this paper.","doi":"10.1109/TFUZZ.2010.2041354","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/91/5439989/05398927.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TFUZZ.2010.2041354","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5439989","startPage":"326","endPage":"335","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Communication-Delay-Distribution-Dependent Networked Control for a Class of T\u2013S Fuzzy Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5398927","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Communication-Delay-Distribution-Dependent Networked Control for a Class of T\u2013S Fuzzy Systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5398927/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 January 2010","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"18","issue":"2","publicationDate":"April 2010","accessionNumber":"11206099","dateOfInsertion":"29 March 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5398927/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Communication-Delay-Distribution-Dependent Networked Control for a Class of T\u2013S Fuzzy Systems","sourcePdf":"tfuzz-peng-2041354.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.107011S","chronDate":"April  2010","xplore-pub-id":"91","isNumber":"5439989","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"91","citationCount":"59","xplore-issue":"5439989","articleId":"5398927","onlineDate":"26 January 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5398942,"authors":[{"name":"Do-Sik Yoo","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, Hongik University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Do-Sik","lastName":"Yoo","id":"37433740300"},{"name":"Wayne E.

Due to the properties of the discrete Hartley transform (DHT), the conventional transmission scheme can be streamlined. We demonstrate that asymmetrically clipping (AC) technique can also be applied to DHT-based OFDM; the signal can be transmitted without the need of a DC bias, resulting in a power-efficient system, not affected by clipping noise. Hermitian symmetry is not required for the input signal. Therefore, this technique supports the double of input symbols compared to both AC and DC-biased O-OFDM, based on standard Fourier processing. The analysis in an additive white Gaussian noise channel shows that the same performance can be achieved by replacing 4, 16, and 64 QAM (quadrature-amplitude modulation) AC optical-OFDM with a simpler system based on DHT, using binary phase-shift keying (BPSK), 4 and 8 PAM (pulse-amplitude modulation), respectively.","doi":"10.1109/JLT.2010.2040580","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/50/5419250/05398945.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JLT.2010.2040580","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5419250","startPage":"798","endPage":"805","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Novel Power Efficient Optical OFDM Based on Hartley Transform for Intensity-Modulated Direct-Detection Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5398945","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Novel Power Efficient Optical OFDM Based on Hartley Transform for Intensity-Modulated Direct-Detection Systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"March1,  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5398945/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 January 2010","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"28","issue":"5","publicationDate":"March1, 2010","accessionNumber":"11152871","dateOfInsertion":"01 March 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5398945/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Novel Power Efficient Optical OFDM Based on Hartley Transform for Intensity-Modulated Direct-Detection Systems","sourcePdf":"jlt-svalutomoreolo-2040580.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.084154S","chronDate":"March1,  2010","xplore-pub-id":"50","isNumber":"5419250","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"72","xplore-issue":"5419250","articleId":"5398945","onlineDate":"26 January 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5398950,"authors":[{"name":"Keqin Liu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of California, Davis, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/5446566/5398950/5398950-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Keqin Liu received the B.S. degree in automation from Southeast University, China, in 2005 and the M.S. degree in electrical engineering from the University of California at Davis, in 2008.

Then, we establish beamforming optimality conditions for all users. Finally, we consider the case as the number of users becomes large, in which case we demonstrate that beamforming is asymptotically optimal.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2010.2041602","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/5446566/05398956.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2010.2041602","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5446566","startPage":"2809","endPage":"2822","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Capacity Bounds and Low Complexity Transceiver Design for Double-Scattering MIMO Multiple Access Channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5398956","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Capacity Bounds and Low Complexity Transceiver Design for Double-Scattering MIMO Multiple Access Channels","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5398956/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 January 2010","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"58","issue":"5","publicationDate":"May 2010","accessionNumber":"11228719","dateOfInsertion":"12 April 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5398956/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Capacity Bounds and Low Complexity Transceiver Design for Double-Scattering MIMO Multiple Access Channels","sourcePdf":"tsp-li-2041602.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.095389S","chronDate":"May  2010","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"5446566","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"5446566","articleId":"5398956","onlineDate":"26 January 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5398960,"authors":[{"name":"Sung-Jung Wu","affiliation":["Department of Communication Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Sung-Jung","lastName":"Wu","id":"37407120200"},{"name":"Cheng-Hung Kang","affiliation":["Department of Communication Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Cheng-Hung","lastName":"Kang","id":"37402153600"},{"name":"Keng-Hsien Chen","affiliation":["Department of Communication Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Keng-Hsien","lastName":"Chen","id":"37404003300"},{"name":"Jenn-Hwan Tarng","affiliation":["Department of Communication Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Jenn-Hwan","lastName":"Tarng","id":"37299419000"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-926X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2221"}],"articleNumber":"5398960","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":40,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":2347},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society","url":"http://www.ieeeaps.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Dipole antennas","Broadband antennas","Microstrip antennas","Wireless LAN","Antennas and propagation","Global Positioning System","Bluetooth","Wireless communication","Safety","Antenna accessories"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Bluetooth","cellular radio","dipole antennas","Global Positioning System","multifrequency antennas","wireless LAN","Yagi antenna arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiband quasiYagi type antenna","GSM900","DCS1800","GPS","Bluetooth","WLAN","quasiYagi antenna design","driver dipole element","antenna operating mechanism","frequency 700 MHz"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["700 MHz band","antenna","multiband antenna","quasi-Yagi antenna"]}],"abstract":"A new design of multiband quasi-Yagi type antenna for 700 MHz band, GSM900, DCS1800, GPS, and Bluetooth/WLAN applications is presented.

After soft-decoding, the received sequences and obtaining the log-likelihood ratio (LLR) values, the relay constructs a product code by arranging the decoded bit sequences in rows and re-encoding them along the columns using a novel soft block encoding technique to obtain soft parity bits with different reliabilities that can be used as soft incremental redundancy (IR) that is forwarded to the destination.

However, some unique characteristics of semiconductor manufacturing processes have posed challenges for FDC applications, such as nonlinearity in most batch processes, and multimodal batch trajectories due to product mix. To explicitly account for these unique characteristics, a pattern recognition based fault detection method utilizing the k-nearest-neighbor rule (FD-kNN) was previously developed. In FD-kNN, historical data are used directly as the reference of normal process operation to determine whether a new measurement is a fault. Therefore, for processes with a large number of variables, it can be computation and storage intensive, and may be difficult for online process monitoring. To address this difficulty, we propose a fast pattern recognition based fault detection method, termed principal component-based kNN (PC-kNN), which takes advantages of both principal component analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction and FD-kNN for nonlinearity and multimode handling. Two simulation examples and an industrial example are used to demonstrate the performance of the proposed PC-kNN method in fault detection.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5398983/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 January 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2010","volume":"23","issue":"2","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11282377","dateOfInsertion":"03 May 2010","publicationDate":"May 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5398983/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Large-Scale Semiconductor Process Fault Detection Using a Fast Pattern Recognition-Based Method","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Large-Scale Semiconductor Process Fault Detection Using a Fast Pattern Recognition-Based Method","sourcePdf":"tsm-he-2041289.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.102177S","chronDate":"May  2010","xplore-pub-id":"66","isNumber":"5458317","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"66","citationCount":"56","xplore-issue":"5458317","articleId":"5398983","onlineDate":"26 January 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5398986,"authors":[{"name":"Richard P.

It is widely known that, when at steady state, the EWMA filter provides the minimum mean square error (MSE) forecast for an integrated moving average (IMA) process. The forecast, however, is optimal if and only if every output of the IMA process is measured. If an EWMA controller is implemented utilizing sampled process data, then it is necessary to retune the controller to maintain optimal performance. Furthermore, in practice, the complex interacting selection criteria of advanced sampling applications often cause measurement frequency to be highly irregular. In this paper, a sampling compensation algorithm (SCA) is derived based on the minimum-norm IMA (MNIMA) forecast. The algorithm provides the minimum mean-square-error (MMSE) forecast of an IMA process for irregularly sampled processes and is robust to initialization.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5398986/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 January 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5398986/","dateOfInsertion":"03 May 2010","publicationDate":"May 2010","accessionNumber":"11282382","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"23","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Compensating for the Initialization and Sampling of EWMA Run-to-Run Controlled Processes","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Compensating for the Initialization and Sampling of EWMA Run-to-Run Controlled Processes","sourcePdf":"tsm-stirton-2041270.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.077767S","chronDate":"May  2010","xplore-pub-id":"66","isNumber":"5458317","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"66","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5458317","articleId":"5398986","onlineDate":"26 January 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5399212,"authors":[{"name":"Ivan Muller","affiliation":["UFRGS, Brazil"],"bio":{"p":["Ivan Muller (ivan.muller@ufrgs.br) received a B.S. degree in electrical engineering in 2003 and the MS Degree in 2008 from the Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil (UFRGS).

When properly designed and used, they are very accurate and reliable sensors. Load cells are applied in several different fields, usually for weighing measurements. Among many other things, food, vehicles, and animals are weighed daily with load cells. The gripper of a robotic arm that picks up an object can be equipped with load cells in order to provide compression force feedback to the control system to prevent the object from being damaged or released too early. Also, load cells can be used to sense the compression forces during a robot's walk to provide data for the equilibrium-controlling system. In industrial machinery, rods, beams, wheels and bars are instrumented in order to check the forces exerted on them. The volume or level of a tank can be measured indirectly by means of a load cell that monitors the total weight. Lift units can also have a load's total weight measured to prevent overload. Because of such a variety of possible applications, load cells are very important. This paper describes some of the theory and practice of load cells, including their basic elements and the electronics necessary for measurement. As an application example, the development of a 3-ring spherical load cell is presented which can be used to measure compression forces on fruit during storage and transportation is presented.","doi":"10.1109/MIM.2010.5399212","pdfPath":"/iel5/5289/5399201/05399212.pdf","startPage":"15","endPage":"19","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Instrumentation & Measurement Magazine","publicationTitle":"IEEE Instrumentation & Measurement Magazine","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MIM.2010.5399212","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5399201","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Load cells in force sensing analysis -- theory and a novel application","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5399212/","chronOrPublicationDate":"February  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 January 2010","displayDocTitle":"Load cells in force sensing analysis -- theory and a novel application","volume":"13","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"29 January 2010","accessionNumber":"11148035","publicationDate":"February 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5399212/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Load cells in force sensing analysis -- theory and a novel application","sourcePdf":"15-19-iamm-13-01-15.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.036231S","chronDate":"February  2010","xplore-pub-id":"5289","isNumber":"5399201","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5289","citationCount":"34","xplore-issue":"5399201","articleId":"5399212","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5399235,"authors":[{"name":"Stephen Cluff","affiliation":["Brigham Young University, Provo, UT, USA"],"firstName":"Stephen","lastName":"Cluff","id":"37564007200"},{"name":"Bryan S.

All of these methods require accurate frame-to-frame registration, which for live use must be performed in real time. In many situations, scene parallax may make alignment using global transformations impossible or error-prone, limiting the performance of subsequent processing and applications. For these cases, dense (per-pixel) correspondence is required, but this can be computationally prohibitive. This paper presents a hierarchical dense correspondence algorithm designed for implementation on graphics processing units (GPUs). Since the method does not rely on epipolar geometry, it is also suitable for use when there are uncor-rected nonlinear lens distortions. A framework for using this dense correspondence to implement local mosaicking, super-resolution enhancement, and mover detection is also presented and demonstrated using examples of each of these types of enhancement and different types of video sources.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"GPU-accelerated hierarchical dense correspondence for real-time aerial video processing","publicationTitle":"2009 Workshop on Motion and Video Computing (WMVC)","doi":"10.1109/WMVC.2009.5399235","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Workshop on Motion and Video Computing (WMVC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5398725/5399227/05399235.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WMVC.2009.5399235","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5399227","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5399235","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5399235/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-9 Dec. 2009","displayDocTitle":"GPU-accelerated hierarchical dense correspondence for real-time aerial video processing","conferenceDate":"8-9 Dec. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5399235/","dateOfInsertion":"29 January 2010","publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","accessionNumber":"11135780","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"GPU-accelerated hierarchical dense correspondence for real-time aerial video processing","confLoc":"Snowbird, UT, USA","sourcePdf":"012.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.088172S","chronDate":"8-9 Dec. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5398725","isNumber":"5399227","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5398725","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5399227","articleId":"5399235","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":5399272,"authors":[{"name":"Ryouhei Kaneko","affiliation":["Graduate School of Fundamental Science and Engineering, Waseda University, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Ryouhei","lastName":"Kaneko","id":"37304062900"},{"name":"Fumiaki Maehara","affiliation":["Graduate School of Fundamental Science and Engineering, Waseda University, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Fumiaki","lastName":"Maehara","id":"37298056500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5346-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5347-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5399272","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":117},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5399272","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wireless communication","Reverberation chamber","Ultra wideband technology","Vehicles","Computer aided manufacturing","Laboratories","Microwave communication","Delay effects","Wireless personal area networks","Wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mobile radio","OFDM modulation","quality of service","ultra wideband communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["coverage area prediction","in-car wireless communications","MB-OFDM UWB systems","in-car propagation environments","quality of service","transmitter","receiver","propagation loss","QoS"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ITST.2009.5399272","pdfPath":"/iel5/5396347/5399269/05399272.pdf","publicationTitle":"2009 9th International Conference on Intelligent Transport Systems Telecommunications, (ITST)","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 9th International Conference on Intelligent Transport Systems Telecommunications, (ITST)","startPage":"667","endPage":"672","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5399269","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ITST.2009.5399272","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Coverage area prediction of in-car wireless communications employing MB-OFDM UWB systems","abstract":"This paper investigates the coverage area of MB-OFDM UWB system under in-car propagation environments.

To show its capabilities, we present two examples of performance evaluation: we measure the bit error rate and packet error rate of an IEEE 802.11p system when performing transmissions between two vehicles that are approaching at high speeds in a highway and in an urban canyon.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 9th International Conference on Intelligent Transport Systems Telecommunications, (ITST)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5396347/5399269/05399287.pdf","startPage":"592","endPage":"597","publicationTitle":"2009 9th International Conference on Intelligent Transport Systems Telecommunications, (ITST)","doi":"10.1109/ITST.2009.5399287","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ITST.2009.5399287","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5399269","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5399287","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"FPGA-based vehicular channel emulator for evaluation of IEEE 802.11p transceivers","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Transceivers","Testing","Performance evaluation","Road vehicles","Vehicle safety","MIMO","Hardware","Road transportation","Road safety","Physical layer"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer network performance evaluation","field programmable gate arrays","transceivers","wireless LAN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FPGA based vehicular channel emulator","IEEE 802.11p transceivers","hardware vehicular channel emulator","commercial emulators","performance evaluation","bit error rate","packet error rate"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5399287/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-22 Oct. 2009","displayDocTitle":"FPGA-based vehicular channel emulator for evaluation of IEEE 802.11p transceivers","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5399287/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","accessionNumber":"11088240","dateOfInsertion":"29 January 2010","conferenceDate":"20-22 Oct. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FPGA-based vehicular channel emulator for evaluation of IEEE 802.11p transceivers","confLoc":"Lille, France","sourcePdf":"session2403.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05004S","chronDate":"20-22 Oct. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5396347","isNumber":"5399269","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5396347","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"5399269","articleId":"5399287","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":5399297,"authors":[{"name":"Fatma Rouissi","affiliation":["Laboratory CIRTACOM, Ecole Sup\u00e9rieure des Communications de Tunis, Tunisia"],"firstName":"Fatma","lastName":"Rouissi","id":"37391533600"},{"name":"Virginie D\u00e9gardin","affiliation":["Laboratory IEMN /TELICE, University of Lille (USTL), Villeneuve d'Ascq, France"],"firstName":"Virginie","lastName":"D\u00e9gardin","id":"37424685200"},{"name":"Martine Li\u00e9nard","affiliation":["Laboratory CIRTACOM, Ecole Sup\u00e9rieure des Communications de Tunis, Tunisia"],"firstName":"Martine","lastName":"Li\u00e9nard","id":"37277919400"},{"name":"Pierre Degauque","affiliation":["Laboratory CIRTACOM, Ecole Sup\u00e9rieure des Communications de Tunis, Tunisia"],"firstName":"Pierre","lastName":"Degauque","id":"37277935200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5346-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5347-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5399297","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":98},"abstract":"Low amplitude impulsive noise measurements have been carried out in the time domain on a vehicle power line network.

In these 4G products, WiMax (worldwide interoperability for microwave access) and LTE (long term evolution) will be the platform technologies. The rapid development of the Internet with new services and applications has created new challenges for the development of mobile communications systems. Many wireless systems offer high data rate services (IEEE 802.11n, IEEE 802.15.3 and IEEE 802.16). Possible migration of 3G to 4G (LTE) will increase data rates throughput in the range of 100 Mbps. These high data rate applications may be difficult to support with the required quality-of-services (QoS) in high mobility environment. For example, the mobile WiMax can be used at mobile speeds of 60 km/h to 120 km/h sufficient for car applications but not for high speed trains. One possible solution is to use a main router for each coach connected with a single antenna to the external broadband network and to distribute the signal inside the coaches thanks to a repeater. An other architecture consider direct transmission to mobile cellular telephone networks using the 3G technology such as the HSDPA (High Speed Downlink Packet Access) and HSUPA (High Speed Uplink Packet Access) allow high-speed data rates, opening the door to a range of mobile usage. All these future and advanced systems are mainly based on orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) known to be resistant to various impairments in the mobile channels. In this paper, a transmission system based on OFDM technique and a solution for channel estimation is proposed. The main results will be presented in the case of high mobility context.","doi":"10.1109/ITST.2009.5399317","publicationTitle":"2009 9th International Conference on Intelligent Transport Systems Telecommunications, (ITST)","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 9th International Conference on Intelligent Transport Systems Telecommunications, (ITST)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5396347/5399269/05399317.pdf","startPage":"425","endPage":"429","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ITST.2009.5399317","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5399269","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Channel estimation of OFDM system for high data rate communications on mobile environments","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5399317","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-22 Oct. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5399317/","displayDocTitle":"Channel estimation of OFDM system for high data rate communications on mobile environments","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","accessionNumber":"11088208","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5399317/","conferenceDate":"20-22 Oct. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"29 January 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Channel estimation of OFDM system for high data rate communications on mobile environments","confLoc":"Lille, France","sourcePdf":"session1704.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062539S","chronDate":"20-22 Oct. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5396347","isNumber":"5399269","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5396347","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"5399269","articleId":"5399317","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5399327,"authors":[{"name":"Roksana Boreli","affiliation":["University of New South Wales, Kensington, Australia","NICTA, Eveleigh, Australia"],"firstName":"Roksana","lastName":"Boreli","id":"37272025900"},{"name":"Yu Ge","affiliation":["Institute for Infocomm Research, Agency for Science, Technology & Research (A*STAR), Singapore"],"firstName":"Yu","lastName":"Ge","id":"37290682100"},{"name":"Thava Iyer","affiliation":["NICTA, Eveleigh, Australia"],"firstName":"Thava","lastName":"Iyer","id":"37392235700"},{"name":"Christoph Dwertmann","affiliation":["NICTA, Eveleigh, Australia"],"firstName":"Christoph","lastName":"Dwertmann","id":"37392232400"},{"name":"Jaya Shankar Pathmasuntharam","affiliation":["Institute for Infocomm Research, Agency for Science, Technology & Research (A*STAR), Singapore"],"firstName":"Jaya Shankar","lastName":"Pathmasuntharam","id":"37279596600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5346-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5347-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5399327","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":16,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":316},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Intelligent networks","Middleware","Mesh networks","Satellite communication","Intelligent systems","Business communication","Marine vehicles","Collaboration","Computer architecture","Hardware"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["marine communication","marine engineering","marine systems","middleware","satellite communication","wireless mesh networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["intelligent middleware","high speed maritime mesh networks","satellite communications","maritime intelligent transport system","social ship based application","legacy satellite communication","middleware system component","mesh connectivity","collaboration project","proof of concept platform","system architecture","hardware module","software module"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["ITS","mesh","satellite","communications"]}],"abstract":"We provide an overview of a Maritime Intelligent Transport System (ITS) which enables increased use of business and social ship based applications by new communications means.

When perfect channel state information (CSI) is available at the transmitter, performance improvement is allowed through a precoding operation. However, the performance of such a closed-loop MIMO system depends on the spatial correlation in the channel, the quantity and the quality of the CSI. A perfect knowledge of the CSI is rarely available in practice because the CSI usually undergoes various impairments, such as channel estimation errors and quantization errors. To overcome these drawbacks, we propose the investigation of two limited feedback precoders that allow us to reduce simultaneously processing complexity and the amount of feedback information. The first, OSM is based on the orthogonalization of the channel and the second is the basic quantized single beamforming based on the Grassmannian line packing technique. The comparison is performed both for an ideal Rayleigh channel and for two typical transmission scenarios in tunnels. Simulation results show that the OSM precoder achieves better performances than the unprecoded scheme, whatever the level of correlation in tunnels. Quantized single beamforming is interesting only for the high-correlated scenario. In this case it outperforms the OSM scheme and the unprecoded scheme.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Impact of spatial correlation on orthogonal precoding for MIMO transmissions in tunnels","publicationTitle":"2009 9th International Conference on Intelligent Transport Systems Telecommunications, (ITST)","doi":"10.1109/ITST.2009.5399363","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 9th International Conference on Intelligent Transport Systems Telecommunications, (ITST)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5396347/5399269/05399363.pdf","startPage":"170","endPage":"175","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ITST.2009.5399363","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5399269","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5399363","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5399363/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-22 Oct. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Impact of spatial correlation on orthogonal precoding for MIMO transmissions in tunnels","conferenceDate":"20-22 Oct. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5399363/","dateOfInsertion":"29 January 2010","publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","accessionNumber":"11133950","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Impact of spatial correlation on orthogonal precoding for MIMO transmissions in tunnels","confLoc":"Lille, France","sourcePdf":"session0703.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.089621S","chronDate":"20-22 Oct. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5396347","isNumber":"5399269","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5396347","xplore-issue":"5399269","articleId":"5399363","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5399365,"authors":[{"name":"Ghadir Madi","affiliation":["XLIM-SIC Laboratory, Poitiers University CNRS UMR 6172, France"],"firstName":"Ghadir","lastName":"Madi","id":"38108603000"},{"name":"Baptiste Vrigneau","affiliation":["XLIM-SIC Laboratory, Poitiers University CNRS UMR 6172, France"],"firstName":"Baptiste","lastName":"Vrigneau","id":"37294005300"},{"name":"Yannis Pousset","affiliation":["XLIM-SIC Laboratory, Poitiers University CNRS UMR 6172, France"],"firstName":"Yannis","lastName":"Pousset","id":"37303156800"},{"name":"Rodolphe Vauzelle","affiliation":["XLIM-SIC Laboratory, Poitiers University CNRS UMR 6172, France"],"firstName":"Rodolphe","lastName":"Vauzelle","id":"37269091100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5346-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5347-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5399365","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":106},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Transmitters","Euclidean distance","Statistics","Channel state information","Maximum likelihood decoding","Constellation diagram","Bit error rate","Laboratories","Random variables"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","error statistics","MIMO communication","precoding","ray tracing","time-varying channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["realistic MIMO time-variant channel","MIMO systems","minimum Euclidean distance","realistic time-variant channel","3D propagation simulation software","raytracing method","Jakes model","channel state information","channel error estimation","precoders"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["MIMO","linear precoder max-dmin","3D raytracing","realistic channel","mobility","Jakes model","estimation error","In-Vehicle","V2V and V2I Communications"]}],"abstract":"Precoders permits to enhance the performance of MIMO systems by optimizing a pertinent criterion of the transmission.

Nevertheless, the improvement will be strongly dependent on the propagation characteristics. If, for example, a ground to train communication is established in a tunnel, experiments described in the first part of the paper, show that at large distance, MIMO only slightly increases the capacity, contrary to what happens at short distance from the transmitter. This is due to a degeneracy of the transfer matrix H related to the propagation in a guiding structure. It is thus interesting to test communication equipments with laboratory setups, able to reproduce not only urban and rural environment but also environments like a tunnel leading to a degenerated H matrix. In this work, a new experimental setup for emulating MIMO channels is thus proposed. The system is composed of two mode stirred reverberation chambers, each one generating Rayleigh environments, which are coupled together with a rectangular waveguide. The transmitting antenna array is placed in one chamber whereas the receiving antenna array is placed in the other one. Depending on the dimension of the guide (i.e. its cut-off frequency), it is shown that one can control the order of the channel diversity. Hence, this setup could not only be used to perform tests of MIMO communication systems in perfectly defined environments but also under reproducible conditions.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"MIMO channel emulator based on reverberation chambers","publicationTitle":"2009 9th International Conference on Intelligent Transport Systems Telecommunications, (ITST)","doi":"10.1109/ITST.2009.5399387","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 9th International Conference on Intelligent Transport Systems Telecommunications, (ITST)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5396347/5399269/05399387.pdf","startPage":"42","endPage":"44","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ITST.2009.5399387","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5399269","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5399387","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5399387/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-22 Oct. 2009","displayDocTitle":"MIMO channel emulator based on reverberation chambers","conferenceDate":"20-22 Oct. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5399387/","dateOfInsertion":"29 January 2010","publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","accessionNumber":"11104643","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"MIMO channel emulator based on reverberation chambers","confLoc":"Lille, France","sourcePdf":"session0203.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054477S","chronDate":"20-22 Oct. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5396347","isNumber":"5399269","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5396347","xplore-issue":"5399269","articleId":"5399387","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5399397,"authors":[{"name":"Wendy Van Moer","affiliation":["Belgium"],"firstName":"Wendy","lastName":"Van Moer","id":"37273913600"},{"name":"Liesbeth Gomme","affiliation":["Department of ELEC/IR, Vrije Universiteit Brussel, Brussels, Belgium"],"firstName":"Liesbeth","lastName":"Gomme","id":"37698281400"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1527-3342"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9581"}],"articleNumber":"5399397","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":38,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":822},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society","url":"http://mtt.org/index.html"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5399397","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Instruments","Frequency measurement","Time measurement","Linear systems","Microwave devices","Circuits","Current measurement","Microwave measurements","Performance evaluation","Signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["microwave devices","microwave measurement","network analysers","nonlinear systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["nonlinear vector network analyzer","NVNA","large-signal network analyzer","LSNA","nonlinear behavior","microwave devices","time domain waveforms","mixer-based architecture","sampler based architecture","nonlinear measurement instruments"]}],"doi":"10.1109/MMM.2009.935213","publicationTitle":"IEEE Microwave Magazine","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Microwave Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel5/6668/5399394/05399397.pdf","startPage":"97","endPage":"103","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MMM.2009.935213","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5399394","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"NVNA versus LSNA: enemies or friends?","abstract":"The NVNA and the LSNA are powerful instruments which allow to measure the full nonlinear behavior of microwave devices.

We can now access voice/data and entertainment in virtually every corner of the globe - with everything from short range Bluetooth and WiFi networks to cellular and satellite networks - to meet different range and throughput requirements. A laptop computer without wireless capability is unthinkable today, whereas, ten years ago, these technologies were in their infancy.What do the next ten years hold? What gaps in wireless technology exist even today? Perhaps the most obvious missing link is between the various devices that we carry with us, such as cellular phones or personal digital assistants (or smart phones if you prefer), digital cameras, music and video players (such as the ubiquitous iPod), laptops, and peripherals such as external hard drives and monitors. The case of the mobile smart phone is particularly important since the existing wireless connectivity is either too slow and power hungry (Bluetooth) or designed and optimized for longer ranges (WiFi). What is missing is a wireless universal connectivity that can support high data rates demanded by large data rate multimedia applications. Wireless technology has been conspicuously absent from MP3 music players (such as Apple's iPod), which are ideal candidates for downloading music and video. While ultrawideband (UWB) technology using the 3-0 GHz band promised to fulfill these needs, it fell short in many ways, and, today, most of the start-up companies pursuing UWB have folded.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5399410/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 January 2010","volume":"11","issue":"1","accessionNumber":"11148044","publicationDate":"Feb. 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5399410/","dateOfInsertion":"29 January 2010","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Siliconization of 60 GHz","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Siliconization of 60 GHz","sourcePdf":"11mmm01-niknejad.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.049614S","chronDate":"Feb.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"6668","isNumber":"5399394","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6668","citationCount":"45","xplore-issue":"5399394","articleId":"5399410","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5399464,"authors":[{"name":"Xue Jun Li","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"firstName":"Xue Jun","lastName":"Li","id":"37065191500"},{"name":"Yue Ping Zhang","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"firstName":"Yue Ping","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37279953700"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1527-3342"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9581"}],"articleNumber":"5399464","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":48,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":1472},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society","url":"http://mtt.org/index.html"}],"abstract":"As CMOS technology is scaled down and adopted for many RF and millimeter-wave radio systems, design of T/R switches in CMOS has received considerable attention.

In event-triggered control, each sensing node continuously monitors the plant in order to determine if fresh information should be transmitted and if the feedback control law should be recomputed. In general, event-triggered control substantially reduces the number of exchanged messages when compared with periodic implementations. However, such energy savings must be contrasted with the energy required to perform local computations. In self-triggered control, computation of the feedback control law is followed by the computation of the next time instant at which fresh information should be sensed and transmitted. Since this time instant is computed as a function of the current state and plant dynamics, it is still much larger than the sampling period used in periodic implementations. Moreover, no energy is spent in local computations at the sensors. However, the plant operates in open-loop between updates of the feedback control law and robustness is a natural concern. We analyze the robustness to disturbances of a self-triggered implementation recently introduced by the authors for linear control systems. We show that such implementation is exponentially input-to-state stable with respect to disturbances.","doi":"10.1109/CDC.2009.5399471","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CDC.2009.5399471","startPage":"928","endPage":"933","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 48h IEEE Conference on Decision and Control (CDC) held jointly with 2009 28th Chinese Control Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5379695/5399469/05399471.pdf","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 48h IEEE Conference on Decision and Control (CDC) held jointly with 2009 28th Chinese Control Conference","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5399469","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Input-to-state stability of self-triggered control systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"15-18 Dec. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Input-to-state stability of self-triggered control systems","conferenceDate":"15-18 Dec. 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"29 January 2010","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5399471/","accessionNumber":"11149398","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5399471/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Input-to-state stability of self-triggered control systems","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"2307.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054007S","chronDate":"15-18 Dec. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5379695","isNumber":"5399469","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5379695","citationCount":"33","xplore-issue":"5399469","articleId":"5399471","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":5399488,"authors":[{"name":"J\u00e9r\u00f4me Berclaz","affiliation":["CVLaboratory, EPF Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland"],"firstName":"J\u00e9r\u00f4me","lastName":"Berclaz","id":"37426477300"},{"name":"Fran\u00e7ois Fleuret","affiliation":["Idiap Research Institute, Martigny, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Fran\u00e7ois","lastName":"Fleuret","id":"37326223600"},{"name":"Pascal Fua","affiliation":["CVLaboratory, EPF Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Pascal","lastName":"Fua","id":"37281288800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5504-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5503-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-5502-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5399488","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":75,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":739},"abstract":"Multi-object tracking can be achieved by detecting objects in individual frames and then linking detections across frames. Such an approach can be made very robust to the occasional detection failure: if an object is not detected in a frame but is in previous and following ones, a correct trajectory will nevertheless be produced. By contrast, a false-positive detection in a few frames will be ignored. However, when dealing with a multiple target problem, the linking step results in a difficult optimization problem in the space of all possible families of trajectories. This is usually dealt with by sampling or greedy search based on variants of dynamic programming, which can easily miss the global optimum. In this paper, we show that reformulating that step as a constrained flow optimization problem results in a convex problem that can be solved using standard linear programming techniques. In addition, this new approach is far simpler formally and algorithmically than existing techniques and yields excellent results on the PETS 2009 data set.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Twelfth IEEE International Workshop on Performance Evaluation of Tracking and Surveillance","pdfPath":"/iel5/5398687/5399473/05399488.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","publicationTitle":"2009 Twelfth IEEE International Workshop on Performance Evaluation of Tracking and Surveillance","doi":"10.1109/PETS-WINTER.2009.5399488","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PETS-WINTER.2009.5399488","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5399473","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5399488","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multiple object tracking using flow linear programming","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Linear programming","Object detection","Joining processes","Detectors","Robustness","Trajectory","Sampling methods","Dynamic programming","Constraint optimization","Positron emission tomography"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["convex programming","dynamic programming","greedy algorithms","linear programming","object detection","sampling methods","search problems","tracking"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["flow linear programming","multiobject tracking","object detection","false-positive detection","sampling","greedy search","dynamic programming","constrained flow optimization problem","convex problem","PETS 2009 data set"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5399488/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-9 Dec. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Multiple object tracking using flow linear programming","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5399488/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","accessionNumber":"11135774","dateOfInsertion":"29 January 2010","conferenceDate":"7-9 Dec. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multiple object tracking using flow linear programming","confLoc":"Snowbird, UT, USA","sourcePdf":"008.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.11131S","chronDate":"7-9 Dec. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5398687","isNumber":"5399473","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5398687","citationCount":"75","xplore-issue":"5399473","articleId":"5399488","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-22"},{"_id":5399498,"authors":[{"name":"Mohammad Al Janaideh","affiliation":["Department of Mechatronics Engineering, University of Jordan, Amman, Jordan"],"firstName":"Mohammad","lastName":"Al Janaideh","id":"37542671600"},{"name":"Ying Feng","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical and Industrial Engineering, Concordia University, Montreal, QUE, Canada"],"firstName":"Ying","lastName":"Feng","id":"37398658100"},{"name":"Subhash Rakheja","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical and Industrial Engineering, Concordia University, Montreal, QUE, Canada"],"firstName":"Subhash","lastName":"Rakheja","id":"37418591000"},{"name":"Yonghong Tan","affiliation":["College of Information, Mechanical and Electronic Engineering, Shanghai Normal University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Yonghong","lastName":"Tan","id":"37363926300"},{"name":"Chun-Yi Su","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical and Industrial Engineering, Concordia University, Montreal, QUE, Canada"],"firstName":"Chun-Yi","lastName":"Su","id":"37281254400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3871-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3872-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0191-2216"},{"format":"CD","value":"0191-2216"}],"articleNumber":"5399498","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":15,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":351},"abstract":"Control of smart actuators is limited due to hysteresis effects which affect the accuracy of these actuators in micropositioning applications. In this paper, a generalized Prandtl-Ishlinskii hysteresis model is presented to characterize hysteresis effects in smart actuators, where a generalized play operator is adopted to formulate the generalized Prandtl-Ishlinskii model. The capability of the formulated model to characterize hysteresis in smart actuators is demonstrated by comparing its outputs with experimental results obtained from piezoceramics, shape memory alloy (SMA), and magnetostrictive actuators. Considering the dynamics of the smart actuators, a robust control is developed to ensure the system stability and improve the output performance. The simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hysteresis","Robust control","Intelligent actuators","Piezoelectric materials","Magnetostriction","Shape memory alloys","Stability","Inverse problems","Saturation magnetization","Density functional theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["intelligent actuators","magnetostrictive devices","micropositioning","modelling","robust control","shape memory effects"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Prandtl-Ishlinskii hysteresis","modeling control","robust control","smart actuators","micropositioning applications","shape memory alloy","magnetostrictive actuators"]}],"doi":"10.1109/CDC.2009.5399498","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 48h IEEE Conference on Decision and Control (CDC) held jointly with 2009 28th Chinese Control Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 48h IEEE Conference on Decision and Control (CDC) held jointly with 2009 28th Chinese Control Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5379695/5399469/05399498.pdf","startPage":"7279","endPage":"7284","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5399469","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CDC.2009.5399498","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Generalized Prandtl-Ishlinskii hysteresis: Modeling and robust control for smart actuators","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5399498","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Generalized Prandtl-Ishlinskii hysteresis: Modeling and robust control for smart actuators","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5399498/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5399498/","accessionNumber":"11148503","conferenceDate":"15-18 Dec. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"29 January 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-18 Dec. 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Generalized Prandtl-Ishlinskii hysteresis: Modeling and robust control for smart actuators","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"2217.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.091433S","chronDate":"15-18 Dec. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5379695","isNumber":"5399469","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5379695","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"5399469","articleId":"5399498","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":5399516,"authors":[{"name":"Nikolaos M.

We introduce and analyze a stochastic model for clocks, in which the relative speedup of a clock, called the skew, is characterized by some given stochastic process. We study the problem of synchronizing clocks in a network, which amounts to estimating the instantaneous relative skews and relative offsets by exchange of time-stamped packets across the links of the network. We present a scheme for obtaining measurements in a communication link. We develop an algorithm for optimal filtering of measurements across a link (i; j) in order to estimate the logarithm of the relative speedup of node j with respect to node i, and we further study some implementation issues. We also present a scheme for pairwise offset estimation based on skew estimates. We study the properties of our algorithms and provide theoretical guarantees on their performance. We also develop an online centralized model-based asynchronous algorithm for optimal filtering of the time-stamps in the entire network, and an efficient distributed suboptimal scheme.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5399516/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-18 Dec. 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"15-18 Dec. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"29 January 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5399516/","accessionNumber":"11148521","displayDocTitle":"A model-based approach to clock synchronization","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A model-based approach to clock synchronization","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"2253.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067667S","chronDate":"15-18 Dec. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5379695","isNumber":"5399469","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5379695","citationCount":"32","xplore-issue":"5399469","articleId":"5399516","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":5399553,"authors":[{"name":"Weina Ge","affiliation":["Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Weina","lastName":"Ge","id":"37403189500"},{"name":"Robert T.

In this paper, we perform pedestrian detection using the reversible jump Markov chain Monte Carlo (RJMCMC) sampling method. A crowd scene is viewed as a realization of a Marked point process (MPP) that consists of a random set of people in a bounded region. Each person is associated with a random `mark' that governs their location and size in the image. To automatically infer the number of people in the scene and their spatial locations, RJMCMC is used to sample person hypotheses from an underlying stochastic process and evaluate them against the image observation to find the optimal configuration that best explains the image. We further extend the detector to hypothesize people not in the image plane but in 3D space, by incorporating multi-view information. The detection performance of both the single- and multi-view versions are evaluated on the crowd counting task in the PETS 2009 dataset.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5399473","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PETS-WINTER.2009.5399553","publicationTitle":"2009 Twelfth IEEE International Workshop on Performance Evaluation of Tracking and Surveillance","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Twelfth IEEE International Workshop on Performance Evaluation of Tracking and Surveillance","pdfPath":"/iel5/5398687/5399473/05399553.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","doi":"10.1109/PETS-WINTER.2009.5399553","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Evaluation of sampling-based pedestrian detection for crowd counting","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-9 Dec. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Evaluation of sampling-based pedestrian detection for crowd counting","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"7-9 Dec. 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5399553/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","accessionNumber":"11103335","dateOfInsertion":"29 January 2010","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5399553/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Evaluation of sampling-based pedestrian detection for crowd counting","confLoc":"Snowbird, UT, USA","sourcePdf":"002.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048871S","chronDate":"7-9 Dec. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5398687","isNumber":"5399473","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5398687","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"5399473","articleId":"5399553","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":5399556,"authors":[{"name":"J.

Finally, the effectiveness of the obtained results is further illustrated by a numerical example in comparison with the existent ones.","doi":"10.1109/CDC.2009.5399640","startPage":"7180","endPage":"7185","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 48h IEEE Conference on Decision and Control (CDC) held jointly with 2009 28th Chinese Control Conference","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CDC.2009.5399640","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5399469","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 48h IEEE Conference on Decision and Control (CDC) held jointly with 2009 28th Chinese Control Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5379695/5399469/05399640.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robust stability analysis on discrete-time Cohen-Grossberg neural networks with distributed delay","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5399640/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Robust stability analysis on discrete-time Cohen-Grossberg neural networks with distributed delay","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5399640/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11148767","publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"29 January 2010","conferenceDate":"15-18 Dec. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-18 Dec. 2009","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust stability analysis on discrete-time Cohen-Grossberg neural networks with distributed delay","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"0699.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.104409S","chronDate":"15-18 Dec. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5379695","isNumber":"5399469","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5379695","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5399469","articleId":"5399640","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5399642,"authors":[{"name":"Ming Wang","affiliation":["Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy and Sciences, Beijing, China","School of Information and Electric Engineering, Shandong Jianzhu University, Jinan, China"],"firstName":"Ming","lastName":"Wang","id":"37539558000"},{"name":"Junzhi Yu","affiliation":["Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy and Sciences, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Junzhi","lastName":"Yu","id":"37278401500"},{"name":"Min Tan","affiliation":["Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy and Sciences, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Min","lastName":"Tan","id":"37274596200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3871-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3872-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0191-2216"},{"format":"CD","value":"0191-2216"}],"articleNumber":"5399642","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":303},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Robot control","Marine animals","Robot kinematics","Mathematical model","Rhythm","Frequency","Turning","Spinal cord","Hydrodynamics","Concrete"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["legged locomotion","motion control","neurocontrollers","stability","underwater vehicles"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neural control modeling","robotic fish","pectoral fins","CPG-based network","3D locomotion control method","central pattern generator network model","stable locomotive rhythms","periodic solution","rhythm generators","motion patterns","pitching mode","backward motion","turning mode","CPG network model","neural control method","robotic applications"]}],"abstract":"A three-dimensional locomotion control method for robotic fish with pectoral fins is presented in this paper. The approach employed a central pattern generator (CPG) network model, which can generate stable locomotive rhythms. The existence of periodic solution of the model has been proved.

Robotic fish driven by pectoral fins is capable of implementing various motion patterns, such as pitching mode, backward motion, turning mode, etc, by using the CPG network model.

Kalman filtering has been an effective algorithm for tracking dynamic processes for over four decades. Distributed Kalman Filtering (DKF) involves design of the information processing algorithm of a network of estimator agents with a two-fold objective: (1) estimate the state of the target of interest and (2) reach a consensus with neighboring estimator agents on the state estimate. We refer to this DKF algorithm as Kalman-Consensus Filter (KCF). The main contributions of this paper are as follows: (i) finding the optimal decentralized Kalman-Consensus filter and showing that its computational and communication costs are not scalable in n and (ii) introducing a scalable suboptimal Kalman-Consensus Filter and providing a formal stability and performance analysis of this distributed and cooperative filtering algorithm. Kalman-Consensus Filtering algorithm is applicable to sensor networks with variable topology including mobile sensor networks and networks with packet-loss.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 48h IEEE Conference on Decision and Control (CDC) held jointly with 2009 28th Chinese Control Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5379695/5399469/05399678.pdf","startPage":"7036","endPage":"7042","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 48h IEEE Conference on Decision and Control (CDC) held jointly with 2009 28th Chinese Control Conference","doi":"10.1109/CDC.2009.5399678","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CDC.2009.5399678","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5399469","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5399678","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Kalman-Consensus Filter : Optimality, stability, and performance","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Stability","State estimation","Filtering algorithms","Target tracking","Kalman filters","Heuristic algorithms","Information filtering","Information filters","Algorithm design and analysis","Information processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["communication complexity","distributed algorithms","Kalman filters","mobile radio","stability","state estimation","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dynamic process tracking","information processing algorithm","neighboring estimator agents","state estimation","distributed Kalman filtering","optimal decentralized Kalman-consensus filter","scalable suboptimal Kalman-consensus Filter","formal stability","performance analysis","distributed algorithm","cooperative filtering algorithm","topology","mobile sensor networks"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["sensor networks","Kalman-Consensus filtering","distributed Kalman filtering","distributed data fusion"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5399678/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-18 Dec. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Kalman-Consensus Filter : Optimality, stability, and performance","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5399678/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","accessionNumber":"11148804","dateOfInsertion":"29 January 2010","conferenceDate":"15-18 Dec. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Kalman-Consensus Filter : Optimality, stability, and performance","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"1538.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064233S","chronDate":"15-18 Dec. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5379695","isNumber":"5399469","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5379695","citationCount":"316","xplore-issue":"5399469","articleId":"5399678","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-19"},{"_id":5399687,"authors":[{"name":"S.

The design is implemented using OLA's to realize the optimal feedback control signal and the associated cost function. The feedforward portion of the control input is derived and approximated using an additional OLA for steady state conditions. Novel tuning laws for the OLA's are derived, and all parameters are tuned online. Lyapunov techniques are used to show that all signals are uniformly ultimately bounded (UUB) and that the approximated control signal approaches the optimal control input with small bounded error. In the ideal case when there are no approximation errors, the approximated control converges to the optimal value asymptotically.

A hot topic of SLAM is how to build a map describing the complex environment. This paper presents a new SLAM algorithm using the sampled environment map, which describes the environment in detail, rather than represent the environment with a small number of geometric parameters. The proposed method segments measurements into primitive objects and fits them with implicit polynomials. Algebraic distances or orthogonal distances are then considered as new measurements, which are used to update the whole state. A method considering geometric constraints is presented to remove redundant environment samples from the SEM. The algorithm's main merits are its compactness and adaptability. Simulation and experimental results demonstrate the efficiency of our algorithm.","doi":"10.1109/CDC.2009.5399721","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CDC.2009.5399721","startPage":"6484","endPage":"6489","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 48h IEEE Conference on Decision and Control (CDC) held jointly with 2009 28th Chinese Control Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5379695/5399469/05399721.pdf","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 48h IEEE Conference on Decision and Control (CDC) held jointly with 2009 28th Chinese Control Conference","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5399469","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Simultaneous localization and sampled environment mapping","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"15-18 Dec. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Simultaneous localization and sampled environment mapping","conferenceDate":"15-18 Dec. 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"29 January 2010","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5399721/","accessionNumber":"11148847","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5399721/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Simultaneous localization and sampled environment mapping","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"1199.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052803S","chronDate":"15-18 Dec. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5379695","isNumber":"5399469","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5379695","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5399469","articleId":"5399721","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":5399729,"authors":[{"name":"M.

The main result is given in a constructive manner by developing a novel nonlinear adaptive observer, without resort to any linearization. The design of the proposed observer does not necessitate the resolution of any dynamics systems and its expression is explicitly given.

used to compute an optimal policy for a controlled Markov chain based on observations of the system controlled using a non-optimal policy. It has proven to be effective for models with finite state and action space. This paper establishes connections between Q-learning and nonlinear control of continuous-time models with general state space and general action space. The main contributions are summarized as follows. (i) The starting point is the observation that the \"Q-function\" appearing in Q-learning algorithms is an extension of the Hamiltonian that appears in the minimum principle. Based on this observation we introduce the steepest descent Q-learning algorithm to obtain the optimal approximation of the Hamiltonian within a prescribed function class, (ii) A transformation of the optimality equations is performed based on the adjoint of a resolvent operator. This is used to construct a consistent algorithm based on stochastic approximation that requires only causal filtering of observations, (iii) Several examples are presented to illustrate the application of these techniques, including application to distributed control of multi-agent systems.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5399753/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-18 Dec. 2009","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"29 January 2010","accessionNumber":"11148939","publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5399753/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"15-18 Dec. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Q-learning and Pontryagin's Minimum Principle","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Q-learning and Pontryagin's Minimum Principle","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"2051.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065403S","chronDate":"15-18 Dec. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5379695","isNumber":"5399469","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5379695","citationCount":"41","xplore-issue":"5399469","articleId":"5399753","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-15"},{"_id":5399767,"authors":[{"name":"Li Peng","affiliation":["School of Communication and Control Engineering, Jiangnan University, China"],"firstName":"Li","lastName":"Peng","id":"37287417700"},{"name":"Mao-hai Wang","affiliation":["School of Communication and Control Engineering, Jiangnan University, China"],"firstName":"Mao-hai","lastName":"Wang","id":"37066489900"},{"name":"Jia-ping Du","affiliation":["School of Communication and Control Engineering, Jiangnan University, China"],"firstName":"Jia-ping","lastName":"Du","id":"37394943200"},{"name":"Gang Luo","affiliation":["School of Communication and Control Engineering, Jiangnan University, China"],"firstName":"Gang","lastName":"Luo","id":"37088024123"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3871-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3872-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0191-2216"},{"format":"CD","value":"0191-2216"}],"articleNumber":"5399767","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":15,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":171},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Particle swarm optimization","Lighting control","Communication system traffic control","Control engineering","Traffic control","Vehicles","Communication system control","Convergence","Chemical industry","Environmental economics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["particle swarm optimisation","road traffic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["isolation niches particle swarm optimization","traffic lights control","two-intersections traffic control method","interferential phenomenon"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Particle swarm optimization","isolation niches","traffic lights controlling","two crossroad","band of green waves"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5399767","abstract":"To keep balance of global and local searching ability, and to overcome the slow convergence and prematurely of particle swarm optimization, a new algorithm that isolation niches embedded in particle swarm optimization (INPSO) is introduced.

A current research goal is to isolate those problems that lead to tractable solutions. In this paper, we identify a special class of optimal impulse control problems which are easy to solve. Easy to solve means that solution algorithms are polynomial in time and therefore suitable to the on-line implementation in real-time problems. We do this by using a paradigm borrowed from the Operations Research field. As main result, we present a solution algorithm that converges to the exact solution in polynomial time. Our approach consists in approximating the optimal impulse control problem via a binary linear programming problem with a totally unimodular constraint matrix. Hence, solving the binary linear programming problem is equivalent to solving its linear relaxation. It turns out that any solution of the linear relaxation is a feasible solution for the optimal impulse control problem. Then, given the feasible solution, obtained solving the linear relaxation, we find the optimal solution via local search.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 48h IEEE Conference on Decision and Control (CDC) held jointly with 2009 28th Chinese Control Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5379695/5399469/05399855.pdf","startPage":"5299","endPage":"5304","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 48h IEEE Conference on Decision and Control (CDC) held jointly with 2009 28th Chinese Control Conference","doi":"10.1109/CDC.2009.5399855","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CDC.2009.5399855","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5399469","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5399855","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal impulse control problems and linear programming","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optimal control","Linear programming","Polynomials","Control systems","Operations research","Cost function","Computational complexity","Control system synthesis","Logistics","Optimal scheduling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","linear programming","matrix algebra","optimal control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optimal impulse control","operations research","polynomial time","binary linear programming","unimodular constraint matrix"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5399855/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-18 Dec. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Optimal impulse control problems and linear programming","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5399855/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","accessionNumber":"11149080","dateOfInsertion":"29 January 2010","conferenceDate":"15-18 Dec. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal impulse control problems and linear programming","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"1855.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068262S","chronDate":"15-18 Dec. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5379695","isNumber":"5399469","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5379695","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5399469","articleId":"5399855","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5399866,"authors":[{"name":"Salvatore Monaco","affiliation":["Universit\u00e0 di Roma \"La Sapienza\", Rome, Italy"],"firstName":"Salvatore","lastName":"Monaco","id":"37299743100"},{"name":"Dorothe\u00e9e Normand-Cyrot","affiliation":["Laboratoire des Signaux et Syst\u00e8mes, CNRS-Supelec, Gif-sur-Yvette, France"],"firstName":"Dorothe\u00e9e","lastName":"Normand-Cyrot","id":"38276868500"},{"name":"Fernando Tiefensee","affiliation":["Laboratoire des Signaux et Syst\u00e8mes, CNRS-Supelec, Gif-sur-Yvette, France"],"firstName":"Fernando","lastName":"Tiefensee","id":"38272473600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3871-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3872-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0191-2216"},{"format":"CD","value":"0191-2216"}],"articleNumber":"5399866","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":93},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Nonlinear control systems","Control systems","Sampling methods","Damping","Control system analysis","Control design","Difference equations","Weight control","Spinning","Gravity"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["nonlinear control systems","sampled data systems","stability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["nonlinear port controlled Hamiltonian systems","nonlinear PCH Hamiltonian systems","Hamiltonian conservation","modified output mapping","sampled data stabilizing controller"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5399866","abstract":"The paper studies how nonlinear PCH Hamiltonian systems are transformed under sampling.

By separating the problems of (1) stochastic performance, and (2) stochastic stabilization and robust constraints fulfillment of the closed-loop system, we aim at obtaining a less conservative control action with respect to classical robust MPC schemes, still enforcing convergence and feasibility properties for the controlled system. Stochastic performance is addressed for very general classes of stochastic disturbance processes, although discretized in the probability space, by adopting ideas from multi-stage stochastic optimization. Stochastic stability and recursive feasibility are enforced through linear matrix inequality (LMI) problems, which are solved off-line; stochastic performance is optimized by an on-line MPC problem which is formulated as a convex quadratically constrained quadratic program (QCQP) and solved in a receding horizon fashion.

In the case of stationary leaders, we show necessary and sufficient conditions on the network topology such that all followers will ultimately converge to the stationary convex hull formed by the stationary leaders for arbitrary initial states in both continuous-time and discrete-time settings. In particular, when the network topology is fixed, the final states of the followers are constant. When the network topology is switching, the final states of the followers might be changing depending on the switching graphs. In the case of dynamic leaders, we propose a distributed tracking control algorithm without velocity measurements and derive conditions on the network topology and the control gain to guarantee that all followers will ultimately converge to the dynamic convex hull formed by the dynamic leaders for arbitrary initial states.","doi":"10.1109/CDC.2009.5399946","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 48h IEEE Conference on Decision and Control (CDC) held jointly with 2009 28th Chinese Control Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 48h IEEE Conference on Decision and Control (CDC) held jointly with 2009 28th Chinese Control Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5379695/5399469/05399946.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CDC.2009.5399946","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5399469","startPage":"3014","endPage":"3019","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Containment control with multiple stationary or dynamic leaders under a directed interaction graph","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5399946","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Containment control with multiple stationary or dynamic leaders under a directed interaction graph","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-18 Dec. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5399946/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"15-18 Dec. 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","accessionNumber":"11149297","dateOfInsertion":"29 January 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5399946/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Containment control with multiple stationary or dynamic leaders under a directed interaction graph","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"1741.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069779S","chronDate":"15-18 Dec. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5379695","isNumber":"5399469","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5379695","citationCount":"105","xplore-issue":"5399469","articleId":"5399946","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5399955,"authors":[{"name":"Michael Caramanis","affiliation":["Systems Engineering, College of Engineering, Boston University, USA"],"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Caramanis","id":"37284699100"},{"name":"Justin M.

EV load management achieves cost savings in both (i) EV battery charging and (ii) the provision of additional regulation service required by wind farm expansion. More specifically, we develop a decision support method for an EV load aggregator or energy service company (ESCo) that controls the battery charging for a fleet of EVs. A hierarchical decision making methodology is proposed for hedging in the day-ahead market and for playing the real-time market in a manner that yields regulation service revenues and allows for negotiated discounts on the use of distribution network payments. Amongst several potential solutions that are available, we employ a rolling horizon look-ahead stochastic dynamic programming algorithm and report some typical computational experience.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 48h IEEE Conference on Decision and Control (CDC) held jointly with 2009 28th Chinese Control Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5379695/5399469/05399955.pdf","startPage":"4717","endPage":"4722","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 48h IEEE Conference on Decision and Control (CDC) held jointly with 2009 28th Chinese Control Conference","doi":"10.1109/CDC.2009.5399955","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CDC.2009.5399955","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5399469","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5399955","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Management of electric vehicle charging to mitigate renewable generation intermittency and distribution network congestion","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Electric vehicles","Power system management","Batteries","Wind energy generation","Energy management","Power system control","Control systems","Load management","Costs","Wind farms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decision making","dynamic programming","electric vehicles","load management","power system control","stochastic programming"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electric vehicle charging","renewable generation intermittency","distribution network congestion","electric vehicle load management","market-based electric power system control","wind farm expansion","decision support method","EV load aggregator","energy service company","hierarchical decision making","distribution network payments","rolling horizon look-ahead stochastic dynamic programming algorithm"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5399955/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-18 Dec. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Management of electric vehicle charging to mitigate renewable generation intermittency and distribution network congestion","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5399955/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","accessionNumber":"11149353","dateOfInsertion":"29 January 2010","conferenceDate":"15-18 Dec. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Management of electric vehicle charging to mitigate renewable generation intermittency and distribution network congestion","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"1718.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.093553S","chronDate":"15-18 Dec. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5379695","isNumber":"5399469","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5379695","citationCount":"95","xplore-issue":"5399469","articleId":"5399955","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5399978,"authors":[{"name":"Yongqiang Ye","affiliation":["The College of Automation Engineering, Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Jiangsu, China","The Department of Mechanical Engineering, Dalhousie University, Halifax, NS, Canada"],"firstName":"Yongqiang","lastName":"Ye","id":"37279357100"},{"name":"Ya-Jun Pan","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical Engineering, Dalhousie University, Halifax, NS, Canada"],"firstName":"Ya-Jun","lastName":"Pan","id":"37401472400"},{"name":"Yash Gupta","affiliation":["The Department of Process Engineering and Applied Science, Dalhousie University, Halifax, NS, Canada"],"firstName":"Yash","lastName":"Gupta","id":"37544291000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3871-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3872-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0191-2216"},{"format":"CD","value":"0191-2216"}],"articleNumber":"5399978","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":178},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5399978","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A power based time domain passivity control for haptic interfaces","abstract":"In this paper, a power based time domain passivity control is presented.
