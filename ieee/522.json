FMEA is a fault avoidance technique whose objective is to identify hazards in requirements that have the potential to either endanger mission success or significantly impact life-cycle costs. FMEA techniques can be profitably applied during the analysis stage to identify potential hazards in requirements and design. As hazards are identified, software defenses can be developed using fault tolerant or self-checking techniques to reduce the probability of their occurrence once the program is implemented. Critical design features can also be demonstrated a priori analytically using proof of correctness techniques prior to their implementation if warranted by cost and criticality.","doi":"10.1109/TR.1979.5220578","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5220554","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TR.1979.5220578","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Reliability","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Reliability","pdfPath":"/iel5/24/5220554/05220578.pdf","startPage":"247","endPage":"249","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Software Failure Modes and Effects Analysis","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug.  1979","displayDocTitle":"Software Failure Modes and Effects Analysis","volume":"R-28","issue":"3","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  1979","dateOfInsertion":"25 August 2009","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 1979","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5220578/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Software Failure Modes and Effects Analysis","sourcePdf":"T-R-vR-28-n3-24.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.101408S","chronDate":"Aug.  1979","isNumber":"5220554","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"24","citationCount":"76","articleId":"5220578","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1979","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5220616,"authors":[{"name":"J.M.

The solutions are obtained using four methods for multiple criteria decision making: 1) strictest-selection, 2) lexicographic, 3) Waltz lexicographic, and 4) sequential multiple-objective problem-solving technique (SEMOPS).

The coefficient matrix of these equations (the transition rate matrix) can be obtained for the whole system through algebraic operations on component transition-rate matrices. Such algebraic operations are performed according to the rules of Kronecker Algebra. We consider system reliability and availability with stress dependence and maintenance policies. Theorems are given for constructing the system matrix in four cases: * Reliability and availability with on-line multiple or single maintenance. * Reliability and availability with system-state dependent failure rates. * Reliabilityand availability with standby components. * Off-line maintainability. The results are expres \u00a7 ed in algebraic terms and as a consequence their implementation by a computer program is straightforward. We also obtain information about the structure of the matrices involved. Such information can considerably improve computational efficiency of the computer codes because it allows introducing special ideas and techniques developed for large-system analysis such as sparsity, decomposition, and tearing.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Reliability","pdfPath":"/iel5/24/5220990/05221004.pdf","startPage":"123","endPage":"132","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Reliability","doi":"10.1109/TR.1981.5221004","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TR.1981.5221004","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5220990","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5221004","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Computer-Oriented Formulation of Transition-Rate Matrices via Kronecker Algebra","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Matrices","Algebra","Availability","Maintenance","Reliability theory","Differential equations","Stress","Matrix decomposition","Computational efficiency","Information analysis"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["s- Dependence","Transition-rate matrix","Markov process"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5221004/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  1981","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"June  1981","displayDocTitle":"Computer-Oriented Formulation of Transition-Rate Matrices via Kronecker Algebra","volume":"R-30","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"June 1981","dateOfInsertion":"25 August 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Computer-Oriented Formulation of Transition-Rate Matrices via Kronecker Algebra","sourcePdf":"T-R-vR-30-n2-14.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.02827S","chronDate":"June  1981","isNumber":"5220990","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"24","citationCount":"51","articleId":"5221004","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1981","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5221022,"authors":[{"name":"Masatoshi Sakawa","affiliation":["Kobe University, Kobe, Japan"],"firstName":"Masatoshi","lastName":"Sakawa","id":"37282530000"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9529"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-1721"}],"articleNumber":"5221022","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":26,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":124},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Reliability Society","url":"http://rs.ieee.org/publications.html"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5221022","abstract":"This paper proposes a large-scale multiobjective optimization method for a series-parallel system by applying both the surrogate worth trade-off method and the dual decomposition method in order to obtain the preferred solution of the decision maker.

This implies that all faults contribute the same amount to the failure rate of the program. The assumption is challenged and an alternative proposed. The suggested model results in earlier fault-fixes having a greater effect than later ones (the faults which make the greatest contribution to the overall failure rate tend to show themselves earlier, and so are fixed earlier), and the DFR property between fault fixes (assurance about programs increases during periods of failure-free operation, as well as at fault fixes). The model is tractable and allows a variety of reliability measures to be calculated. Predictions of total execution time to achieve a target reliability, and total number of fault fixes to target reliability, are obtained. The model might also apply to hardware reliability growth resulting from the elimination of design errors.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Stochastic processes","Reliability theory","Hardware","Software reliability","Software debugging","Battery powered vehicles","Computer errors","Reliability engineering","Predictive models","Time measurement"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Software faults","Software failure rate","Software errors","Software reliability","Program debugging model","Reliability growth","Probability distribution mixture","Pareto distribution","Decreasing failure rate","Design errors","Design debugging"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TR.1981.5221099","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Reliability","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Reliability","pdfPath":"/iel5/24/5221088/05221099.pdf","startPage":"313","endPage":"320","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5221088","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TR.1981.5221099","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Stochastic Reliability-Growth: A Model for Fault-Removal in Computer-Programs and Hardware-Designs","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5221099","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Stochastic Reliability-Growth: A Model for Fault-Removal in Computer-Programs and Hardware-Designs","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5221099/","volume":"R-30","issue":"4","publicationDate":"Oct. 1981","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"25 August 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  1981","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct.  1981","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Stochastic Reliability-Growth: A Model for Fault-Removal in Computer-Programs and Hardware-Designs","sourcePdf":"T-R-vR-30-n4-11.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.033894S","chronDate":"Oct.  1981","isNumber":"5221088","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"24","citationCount":"167","articleId":"5221099","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1981","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5221117,"authors":[{"name":"C.

The algorithm is based on the criterion, called margin-enhanced maximum mutual information (MEMMI), and it estimates the CDHMM parameters by maximizing the weighted sum of the maximum mutual information objective function and the large margin objective function. The MEMMI is motivated by the criterion used in such classifier as the soft margin support vector machine that maximizes the weighted sum of the empirical risk function and the margin-related generalization function. The algorithm is an iterative procedure, and at each stage, it updates the parameters by placing different weights on the utterances according to their log likelihood margins: incorrectly-classified (negative margin) utterances are emphasized more than correctly-classified utterances. The MEMMI leads to a simple objective function that can be optimized easily by a gradient ascent algorithm maintaining a probabilistic model. Experimental results show that the recognition accuracy of the MEMMI is better than other discriminative training criteria, such as the approximated maximum mutual information (AMMI), the maximum classification error (MCE), and the soft large margin estimation (SLME) on the TIDIGITS database.","doi":"10.1109/ISIE.2009.5221315","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Symposium on Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Symposium on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/5197533/5213059/05221315.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIE.2009.5221315","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5213059","startPage":"1347","endPage":"1351","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Margin-enhanced maximum mutual information estimation for hidden Markov models","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5221315","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Margin-enhanced maximum mutual information estimation for hidden Markov models","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 July 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5221315/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"5-8 July 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2009","accessionNumber":"10859744","dateOfInsertion":"25 August 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5221315/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Margin-enhanced maximum mutual information estimation for hidden Markov models","confLoc":"Seoul, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"TPII04-6.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049702S","chronDate":"5-8 July 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5197533","isNumber":"5213059","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5197533","xplore-issue":"5213059","articleId":"5221315","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5221375,"authors":[{"name":"K.K.

The concept of a computing transfer function is introduced for this purpose, permitting the evaluation of an effective bandwidth, the latter being connected with the variance of the output for wideband inputs. Limited bandwidth is considered as equivalent to finite resolution and thus to an additional effective error. Single frequency errors are dealt with separately and are shown to be of minor importance. Suitable optimalization of dynamic accuracy yields parameters of design and performance such as optimum computing time and required base amplifier gain. The theory is applied to integrators and adders with base amplifiers of direct and of capacitive coupling.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5221575/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"June  1957","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  1957","volume":"EC-6","issue":"2","dateOfInsertion":"25 August 2009","publicationDate":"June 1957","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Dynamic Accuracy as a Design Criterion of Linear Electronic-Analog Differential Analyzers","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamic Accuracy as a Design Criterion of Linear Electronic-Analog Differential Analyzers","sourcePdf":"T-ELCOMP-vEC-6-n2-6.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.039191S","chronDate":"June  1957","isNumber":"5221569","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5407885","citationCount":"3","articleId":"5221575","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1957","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5221579,"authors":[{"name":"David C.

Unilateral transmission of information in circuits consisting of cascaded twins is achieved by dividing the twins into three groups and by energizing each group one after another in a cyclic manner.

Previous analytic methods have been used either to determine the reliability or capacity disregarding the other parameter. This leads to erroneous conclusions about the performance of the network. This paper suggests a method to integrate these two important measures by defining a weighted reliability index. The states which lead to at least one available path between the terminal nodes are identified and probability of each of these is multiplied by a normalized weight. The sum of these products is the performance index of the network. An example illustrates the method and thereafter several practical situations are discussed.","doi":"10.1109/TR.1985.5221990","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Reliability","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Reliability","pdfPath":"/iel5/24/5221955/05221990.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TR.1985.5221990","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5221955","startPage":"184","endPage":"186","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Integration of Reliability and Capacity in Performance Measure of a Telecommunication Network","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5221990","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Integration of Reliability and Capacity in Performance Measure of a Telecommunication Network","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  1985","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5221990/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"June  1985","isJournal":true,"volume":"R-34","issue":"2","publicationDate":"June 1985","dateOfInsertion":"25 August 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Integration of Reliability and Capacity in Performance Measure of a Telecommunication Network","sourcePdf":"T-R-vR-34-n2-35.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.032624S","chronDate":"June  1985","isNumber":"5221955","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"24","citationCount":"41","articleId":"5221990","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1985","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5222004,"authors":[{"name":"Kaushik Datta","affiliation":["CRD/NERSC, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Berkeley, CA, USA","Computer Science Division, University of California Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Kaushik","lastName":"Datta","id":"37890677800"},{"name":"Mark Murphy","affiliation":["Computer Science Division, University of California Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Mark","lastName":"Murphy","id":"37393388100"},{"name":"Vasily Volkov","affiliation":["Computer Science Division, University of California Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Vasily","lastName":"Volkov","id":"37690342900"},{"name":"Samuel Williams","affiliation":["CRD/NERSC, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Berkeley, CA, USA","Computer Science Division, University of California Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Samuel","lastName":"Williams","id":"37401658600"},{"name":"Jonathan Carter","affiliation":["CRD/NERSC, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Berkeley, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Jonathan","lastName":"Carter","id":"37069349700"},{"name":"Leonid Oliker","affiliation":["CRD/NERSC, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Berkeley, CA, USA","Computer Science Division, University of California Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Leonid","lastName":"Oliker","id":"37281795400"},{"name":"David Patterson","affiliation":["CRD/NERSC, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Berkeley, CA, USA","Computer Science Division, University of California Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, USA"],"firstName":"David","lastName":"Patterson","id":"37274686300"},{"name":"John Shalf","affiliation":["CRD/NERSC, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Berkeley, CA, USA"],"firstName":"John","lastName":"Shalf","id":"37281789600"},{"name":"Katherine Yelick","affiliation":["CRD/NERSC, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Berkeley, CA, USA","Computer Science Division, University of California Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Katherine","lastName":"Yelick","id":"37281788900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2834-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2835-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2167-4329"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2167-4337"}],"articleNumber":"5222004","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":252,"citationCountPatent":8,"totalDownloads":767},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multicore processing","Computer architecture","Scientific computing","Computer industry","Grid computing","Heart","Runtime environment","Sun","Optimization methods","Algorithm design and analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer architecture","grid computing","microprocessor chips","optimisation","partial differential equations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["state-of-the-art multicore architectures","stencil computation optimization","structured grid codes","PDE solvers","partial differential equation","auto-tuning environment","Intel Clovertown","AMD Barcelona","Sun Victoria Falls","IBM QS22 PowerXCell 8i","NVIDIA GTX280","auto-tuning optimization methodology"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5222004","abstract":"Understanding the most efficient design and utilization of emerging multicore systems is one of the most challenging questions faced by the mainstream and scientific computing industries in several decades.

We develop a number of effective optimization strategies, and build an auto-tuning environment that searches over our optimizations and their parameters to minimize runtime, while maximizing performance portability. To evaluate the effectiveness of these strategies we explore the broadest set of multicore architectures in the current HPC literature, including the Intel Clovertown, AMD Barcelona, Sun Victoria Falls, IBM QS22 PowerXCell 8i, and NVIDIA GTX280.

The optimization consists of minimizing the expected risk for a weight function which is preassigned to measure the consequences of system decisions As an alternative minimization of the error rate for a given rejection rate is used as the critenon. The optimum recogition is thus obtained. The optimum system consists of a conditional-probability densisities computer; character channels, one for each character; a rejection channel; and a comparison network. Its precise structure and and ultimate performance depend essentially upon the signals and noise structure. Explicit examples for an additive Gaussian noise and a ``cosine'' noise are presented.

The modification for integral numbers is essentially the addition of an even parity check bit to the Gray code representation. This facilitates both the arithmetic operations and the detection of errors-in the arithmetic process as well as in transmission. An adder using this code requires circuitry which is more complex than that of a conventional binary adder by a factor of about two or three.

Methods of representing the complex capacitance are discussed and a model is selected which is conveniently suited to the analysis. Experimental methods of measuring the complex capacitance are described. The phenomenon of dielectric absorption is interpreted in terms of the capacitor model and it is shown that an integrator having such a feedback capacitor will experience a change in effective initial conditions after a solution is started on the computer. It is also shown that when such integrators are used to solve linear differential equations with constant coefficients, the locations of the roots of the characteristic equation are changed slightly; these changes can be evaluated when the properties of the capacitor model are known.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5222090/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1958","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1958","publicationDate":"March 1958","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"25 August 2009","volume":"EC-7","issue":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"An Analysis of Certain Errors in Electronic Differential Analyzers II-Capacitor Dielectric Absorption","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Analysis of Certain Errors in Electronic Differential Analyzers II-Capacitor Dielectric Absorption","sourcePdf":"T-ELCOMP-vEC-7-n1-7.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.040524S","chronDate":"March  1958","isNumber":"5222083","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5407885","citationCount":"28","articleId":"5222090","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1958","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5222096,"authors":[{"name":"R.

The properties of uniqueness, stability and strong immunity to forgery of the vein patterns would make a potentially good biometric trait offer secure and reliable features for person identity verification. In this paper, a novel approach for personal verification by analyzing the face patterns formed by thermal imaging is presented. A new feature set is proposed to represent the thermal face: the bifurcation points of the thermal pattern and the geographical gravity center of the thermal face region. We proposed to use the Modified Hausdorff Distance to measure the similarity between two feature vectors of the thermal face.

But it is difficult, if not impossible, to allow for dependencies (such as repair dependency and near-coincident-fault type dependency), transient and intermittent faults, standby systems with warm spares, and so on. Markov models can capture such important system behavior, but the size of a Markov model can grow exponentially with the number of components in this system. This paper presents an approach for avoiding the large state space problem. The approach uses a hierarchical modeling technique for analyzing complex reliability models. It allows the flexibility of Markov models where necessary and retains the efficiency of combinatorial solution where possible. Based on this approach a computer program called SHARPE (Symbolic Hierarchical Automated Reliability and Performance Evaluator) has been written. The hierarchical modeling technique provides a very flexible mechanism for using decomposition and aggregation to model large systems; it allows for both combinatorial and Markov or semi-Markov submodels, and can analyze each model to produce a distribution function. The choice of the number of levels of models and the model types at each level is left up to the modeler. Component distribution functions can be any exponential polynomial whose range is between zero and one. Examples show how combinations of models can be used to evaluate the reliability and availability of large systems using SHARPE.","doi":"10.1109/TR.1987.5222336","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Reliability","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Reliability","pdfPath":"/iel5/24/5222327/05222336.pdf","startPage":"186","endPage":"193","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TR.1987.5222336","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5222327","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reliability Modeling Using SHARPE","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5222336/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"June  1987","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  1987","displayDocTitle":"Reliability Modeling Using SHARPE","volume":"R-36","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"June 1987","dateOfInsertion":"25 August 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reliability Modeling Using SHARPE","sourcePdf":"T-R-vR-36-n2-9.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.039617S","chronDate":"June  1987","isNumber":"5222327","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"24","citationCount":"191","articleId":"5222336","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1987","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5222397,"authors":[{"name":"F.

Hybrid microelectronics are moving toward submicron geometries for semiconductor components, multilayer interconnects, and higher component densities on larger area substrates. This miniaturization increases the susceptibility of microelectronic circuitry to electrical overstress (EOS) and electrostatic discharge (ESD). Since EOS and ESD directly affect reliability and maintainability, procedures must be developed to account for them in engineering design, manufacturing, and testing. Over the past several years, there has been a concerted effort to raise ESD awareness at all levels of design and production at Motorola and other electronic firms. This paper briefly describes what measures should be considered and presents examples of their implementation at Motorola to increase reliability, lower costs, and reduce maintainability factors.","doi":"10.1109/TR.1987.5222397","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TR.1987.5222397","startPage":"351","endPage":"354","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Reliability","pdfPath":"/iel5/24/5222371/05222397.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Reliability","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5222371","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Electrostatic-Discharge Awareness & Control \u07dd An R&M 2000 Issue","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug.  1987","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  1987","displayDocTitle":"Electrostatic-Discharge Awareness & Control \u07dd An R&M 2000 Issue","publicationDate":"Aug. 1987","dateOfInsertion":"25 August 2009","volume":"R-36","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5222397/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Electrostatic-Discharge Awareness & Control \u07dd An R&M 2000 Issue","sourcePdf":"T-R-vR-36-n3-26.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.015959S","chronDate":"Aug.  1987","isNumber":"5222371","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"24","citationCount":"1","articleId":"5222397","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1987","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":5222462,"authors":[{"name":"Michael Pecht","affiliation":["University of Maryland, College Park, USA"],"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Pecht","id":"37274594800"},{"name":"Milton Palmer","affiliation":["University of Maryland, College Park, USA"],"firstName":"Milton","lastName":"Palmer","id":"37902638600"},{"name":"Wolfgang Schenke","affiliation":["Calay, Inc., Irvine, USA"],"firstName":"Wolfgang","lastName":"Schenke","id":"37889106700"},{"name":"Richard Porter","affiliation":["Westinghouse Defense\uc2a0and\uc2a0Electronics\uc2a0SystemsCenter, Baltimore, USA"],"firstName":"Richard","lastName":"Porter","id":"37902744800"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9529"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-1721"}],"articleNumber":"5222462","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":43},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Reliability Society","url":"http://rs.ieee.org/publications.html"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Routing","Guidelines","Wiring","Aerospace testing","Cooling","Educational institutions","Reliability engineering","Design engineering","Design automation","Wire"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Printed wiring board","Routing","Component placement"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5222462","abstract":"The tradeoffs between routing and reliability were measured for various component placements on a multi-layer, primarily digital, printed wiring board (PWB).

This system uses Fiber grating (FG) based 3D vision sensor. The sensor system encodes the space coarsely by using limited number of geometrically interrelated 2D laser spots generated through two perpendicularly overlaid layers of FGs and projected on a targeted scene. The reflected spots and specially the disturbed due to the presence of an object or a person play an essential role in detecting targets. The author developed zone-based strategy to enable person detection within any of the zones, track the transitional movement between zones and use inter-zones relation to conclude human behavioral status. This approach has the advantage of reducing significantly the computation time of 3D information that is required for real time tracking and monitoring of human movement. The system has been implemented and this paper presents its operational characteristics. The developed tracking strategy is introduced with its application to monitor the behavior of a person and to help a mobile robot to detect obstacles.","doi":"10.1109/ISIE.2009.5222538","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Symposium on Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Symposium on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/5197533/5213059/05222538.pdf","startPage":"xix","endPage":"xxiii","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIE.2009.5222538","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5213059","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Real time monitoring and avoidance using FG based 3D vision system","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5222538","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 July 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5222538/","displayDocTitle":"Real time monitoring and avoidance using FG based 3D vision system","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2009","accessionNumber":"10859877","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5222538/","conferenceDate":"5-8 July 2009","dateOfInsertion":"25 August 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Real time monitoring and avoidance using FG based 3D vision system","confLoc":"Seoul, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"Invited_Talks_f.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069904S","chronDate":"5-8 July 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5197533","isNumber":"5213059","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5197533","xplore-issue":"5213059","articleId":"5222538","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5222548,"authors":[{"name":"G.

An algorithm of bridging GPS outages using radial basis function neural network is presented to improve accuracy of the navigation system during the GPS outages. This method uses radial basis function neural network to predict measurement of GPS/SINS Kalman filter during GPS outages in order to ensure the regular operation of the filter, resulting in reliable performance of the system.

We propose a novel load balancing algorithm called VectorDot for handling the hierarchical and multi-dimensional resource constraints in such systems. The algorithm, inspired by the successful Toyoda method for multi-dimensional knapsacks, is the first of its kind. We evaluate our system on a range of synthetic and real data center testbeds comprising of VMware ESX servers, IBM SAN Volume Controller, Cisco and Brocade switches.

Reactive fault tolerance (FT) often does not scale due to massive I/O requirements and relies on manual job resubmission. This work complements reactive with proactive FT at the process level. Through health monitoring, a subset of node failures can be anticipated when one's health deteriorates. A novel process-level live migration mechanism supports continued execution of applications during much of processes migration. This scheme is integrated into an MPI execution environment to transparently sustain health-inflicted node failures, which eradicates the need to restart and requeue MPI jobs. Experiments indicate that 1-6.5 seconds of prior warning are required to successfully trigger live process migration while similar operating system virtualization mechanisms require 13-24 seconds. This self-healing approach complements reactive FT by nearly cutting the number of checkpoints in half when 70% of the faults are handled proactively.","displayPublicationTitle":"SC '08: Proceedings of the 2008 ACM/IEEE Conference on Supercomputing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5206875/5213127/05222634.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"12","publicationTitle":"SC '08: Proceedings of the 2008 ACM/IEEE Conference on Supercomputing","doi":"10.1109/SC.2008.5222634","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SC.2008.5222634","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5213127","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5222634","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Proactive process-level live migration in HPC environments","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Condition monitoring","Computer science","Fault tolerant systems","Middleware","Temperature sensors","US Department of Energy","Chaos","Mathematics","Fault tolerance","Operating systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fault tolerant computing","message passing","parallel processing","system monitoring"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["proactive process-level live migration","HPC environment","high-performance computing environment","reactive fault tolerance","I/O requirements","manual job resubmission","health monitoring","node failures","MPI execution environment","health-inflicted node failure"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5222634/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-21 Nov. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Proactive process-level live migration in HPC environments","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5222634/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","accessionNumber":"10846520","dateOfInsertion":"25 August 2009","conferenceDate":"15-21 Nov. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Proactive process-level live migration in HPC environments","confLoc":"Austin, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"pap147.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.139805S","chronDate":"15-21 Nov. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"5206875","isNumber":"5213127","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5206875","citationCount":"129","xplore-issue":"5213127","articleId":"5222634","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5222642,"authors":[{"name":"Kevin A.

OpenUH provides auto-instrumentation of source code for performance experimentation and PerfExplorer provides automated and reusable analysis of the performance data through a scripting interface. More importantly, PerfExplorer inference rules have been developed to recognize and diagnose performance characteristics important for optimization strategies and modeling. Three case studies are presented which show our success with automation in OpenMP and MPI code tuning, parametric characterization, Pand power modeling.

A technique is formulated for using the CORDIC arithmetic unit to convert between angles expressed in degrees and minutes in the 8, 4, 2, 1 code and angles expressed in binary fractions of a half revolution. Decimal-to-binary conversion is accomplished through the generation of an intermediate binary code in which the variable values are +1 and -1. Each of these intermediate code variables controls the addition or subtraction of a particular binary constant in the formation of an accumulated sum which represents the angle. Examples are presented to illustrate the technique. Binary-to-decimal conversion is accomplished by applying essentially the same conversion steps in reverse order, but this feature is not discussed fully. Fundamental principles of the conversion technique, rather than details of implementation, are emphasized. The CORDIC conversion technique is sufficiently general to be applied to decimal-binary conversion problems involving other mixed radix systems and other decimal codes.","doi":"10.1109/TEC.1959.5222694","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TEC.1959.5222694","startPage":"335","endPage":"339","publicationTitle":"IRE Transactions on Electronic Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"IRE Transactions on Electronic Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/5407885/5222675/05222694.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5222675","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Decimal-Binary Conversions in CORDIC","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5222694/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  1959","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  1959","displayDocTitle":"Decimal-Binary Conversions in CORDIC","volume":"EC-8","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"25 August 2009","publicationDate":"Sept. 1959","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Decimal-Binary Conversions in CORDIC","sourcePdf":"T-ELCOMP-vEC-8-n3-19.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.031619S","chronDate":"Sept.  1959","isNumber":"5222675","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5407885","citationCount":"17","articleId":"5222694","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1959","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5222697,"authors":[{"name":"M.

Its implementation involves file domain partitioning, and having the right partitioning is a key to achieving high-performance I/O. As modern parallel file systems maintain data consistency by adopting a distributed file locking mechanism to avoid centralized lock management, different locking protocols can have significant impact to the degree of parallelism of a given file domain partitioning method. In this paper, we propose dynamic file partitioning methods that adapt according to the underlying locking protocols in the parallel file systems and evaluate the performance of four partitioning methods under two locking protocols. By running multiple I/O benchmarks, our experiments demonstrate that no single partitioning guarantees the best performance. Using MPI-IO as an implementation platform, we provide guidelines to select the most appropriate partitioning methods for various I/O patterns and file systems.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dynamically adapting file domain partitioning methods for collective I/O based on underlying parallel file system locking protocols","publicationTitle":"SC '08: Proceedings of the 2008 ACM/IEEE Conference on Supercomputing","doi":"10.1109/SC.2008.5222722","displayPublicationTitle":"SC '08: Proceedings of the 2008 ACM/IEEE Conference on Supercomputing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5206875/5213127/05222722.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"12","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SC.2008.5222722","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5213127","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5222722","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5222722/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-21 Nov. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Dynamically adapting file domain partitioning methods for collective I/O based on underlying parallel file system locking protocols","conferenceDate":"15-21 Nov. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5222722/","dateOfInsertion":"25 August 2009","publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","accessionNumber":"10859634","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamically adapting file domain partitioning methods for collective I/O based on underlying parallel file system locking protocols","confLoc":"Austin, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"pap313.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.076351S","chronDate":"15-21 Nov. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"5206875","isNumber":"5213127","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5206875","citationCount":"53","xplore-issue":"5213127","articleId":"5222722","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5222730,"authors":[{"name":"Imen Bahri","affiliation":["L.

To clarify the effectiveness of agile methods, we reviewed the agile development literature and conducted a systematic study of what we know empirically about its benefits and limitations.","doi":"10.1109/MS.2009.145","publicationTitle":"IEEE Software","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Software","pdfPath":"/iel5/52/5222779/05222784.pdf","startPage":"6","endPage":"9","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MS.2009.145","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5222779","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"What Do We Know about Agile Software Development?","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5222784/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 August 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.-Oct.  2009","displayDocTitle":"What Do We Know about Agile Software Development?","volume":"26","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept.-Oct. 2009","accessionNumber":"10846855","htmlLink":"/document/5222784/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"25 August 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"What Do We Know about Agile Software Development?","sourcePdf":"mso2009050006.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.07096S","chronDate":"Sept.-Oct.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"52","isNumber":"5222779","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"52","citationCount":"107","xplore-issue":"5222779","articleId":"5222784","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5222872,"authors":[{"name":"Fanping Zeng","affiliation":["Department of Computer, University of Science and Technology, Hefei, Anhui, China","Anhui Province Key Lab of Software in Computer and Communication, Hefei, Anhui, PR China","Department of computer, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, Anhui, PR China"],"firstName":"Fanping","lastName":"Zeng","id":"37405645300"},{"name":"Kaitao Yin","affiliation":["Department of computer, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, Anhui, PR China"],"firstName":"Kaitao","lastName":"Yin","id":"37663592700"},{"name":"Minghui Chen","affiliation":["Department of Computer, University of Science and Technology, Hefei, Anhui, China","Department of computer, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, Anhui, PR China"],"firstName":"Minghui","lastName":"Chen","id":"37657179600"},{"name":"Xufa Wang","affiliation":["Department of Computer, University of Science and Technology, Hefei, Anhui, China","Anhui Province Key Lab of Software in Computer and Communication, Hefei, Anhui, PR China","Department of computer, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, Anhui, PR China"],"firstName":"Xufa","lastName":"Wang","id":"37293619100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3641-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5222872","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":150},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hidden Markov models","Intrusion detection","Computer networks","Electronic mail","Software","Computer security","Phase detection","Set theory","Information science","Costs"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hidden Markov models","rough set theory","security of data"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["anomaly detection","rough set reduction","network security","hidden Markov model","intrusion detection"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Hidden Markov model","rough set reduction","decision condition","anomaly detection","system call"]}],"abstract":"Over the past few years, anomaly detection has been an increasing concern with the rapid growth of the network security. Hidden Markov model (HMM) has been applied in various methods in intrusion detection and proved to be a good tool to model normal behaviors of privileged processes, however, one major problem with this approach is that it demands excessive computing resources and costs a long model training time, which makes it inefficient for practical intrusion detection. This paper presents a new method of bringing rough set reduction into HMM to overcome the shortcoming. The proposed approach classifies and simplifies the long observation sequence by virtue of rough set reduction, and the decision conditions obtained in rough set reduction phase could be used in further detection. The experimental results indicate that this method can promote the model training efficiency. Further-more, it is suitable for anomaly detection with high detect rate and low false alarm rate.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A New Anomaly Detection Method Based on Rough Set Reduction and HMM","publicationTitle":"2009 Eighth IEEE/ACIS International Conference on Computer and Information Science","doi":"10.1109/ICIS.2009.140","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Eighth IEEE/ACIS International Conference on Computer and Information Science","pdfPath":"/iel5/5222859/5222860/05222872.pdf","startPage":"285","endPage":"289","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIS.2009.140","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5222860","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5222872","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5222872/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-3 June 2009","displayDocTitle":"A New Anomaly Detection Method Based on Rough Set Reduction and HMM","conferenceDate":"1-3 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5222872/","dateOfInsertion":"25 August 2009","publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10846527","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A New Anomaly Detection Method Based on Rough Set Reduction and HMM","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"3641a285.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060308S","chronDate":"1-3 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5222859","isNumber":"5222860","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5222859","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5222860","articleId":"5222872","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5222874,"authors":[{"name":"Wang Lina","affiliation":["Department of Communication Engineering, University of Science and Technology Beijing, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Wang","lastName":"Lina","id":"37396345400"},{"name":"Wang Yijiang","affiliation":["Department of Communication Engineering, University of Science and Technology Beijing, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Wang","lastName":"Yijiang","id":"37888993500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3619-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5222874","dbTime":"15 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":260},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Security","Cognitive radio","Chromium","Spread spectrum communication","Interference suppression","Frequency synchronization","Narrowband","Educational technology","FCC","Ubiquitous computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","interference suppression","spectral analysis","telecommunication security"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["security enhancement","cognitive radio systems","spectrum utilization systems","opportunistic spectrum sharing","frequency hopping technology","interference suppression"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["cognitive radio","frequency hopping","spectrum sensing","interference"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Method for Security Enhancement of Cognitive Radio Systems","doi":"10.1109/IUCE.2009.41","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5222865","endPage":"344","publicationTitle":"2009 International Symposium on Intelligent Ubiquitous Computing and Education","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Symposium on Intelligent Ubiquitous Computing and Education","pdfPath":"/iel5/5222864/5222865/05222874.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IUCE.2009.41","startPage":"341","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5222874","abstract":"Cognitive radio is an advanced technology for more efficient spectrum utilization systems based on opportunistic spectrum sharing.

Unfortunately, in such an environment failure may occur occasionally or a volatile host can delay the entire execution for a long period of time, which in turn can fail taskpsilas execution. In this paper, a Novel Fault-tolerant Particle Swarm Optimization Scheduler (NFPSO) is suggested to schedule independent tasks. This approach aims to generate a scheduling plan to overcome the resource failure problem while it decreases total taskpsilas completion time, cost and the percentage of Unsuccessful scheduled task. The experimental results of NFPSO scheduler are compared with results of Genetic Algorithm, Simulated Annealing, mountain Climbing and a Random scheduler.

Spatial locality of processing cores in a multi-core chip can be exploited to gain computational efficiency of a network on chip. In this paper we propose a new criterion in performance evaluation of NoC architecture that is based on the concept of group locality in an interconnection network, the \"lower layer complete connect\". TriBA a new idea in multi-core architectures and a direct interconnection network (DIN), is compared with 2D mesh on single chip multi core architecture. TriBA consists of a 2D grid of small, programmable processing units, each physically connected to its three neighbors so that advantageous features of group locality can be fully and efficiently utilized for getting maximum out of an on-chip interconnection of cores. Cores on the same chip are connected via triplet-based hierarchical interconnection network (THIN), which has simple topology and computing locality characteristic. We have modeled execution of dense matrix and sorting algorithm on an on-chip multi core interconnection network. Our results show that triplet based interconnection architecture has strong spatial locality characteristics in comparison to the conventional 2D mesh. The computational efficiency of triplet based interconnection is remarkable when the number of processing cores increase substantially.","doi":"10.1109/ICIS.2009.137","publicationTitle":"2009 Eighth IEEE/ACIS International Conference on Computer and Information Science","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Eighth IEEE/ACIS International Conference on Computer and Information Science","pdfPath":"/iel5/5222859/5222860/05222951.pdf","startPage":"516","endPage":"521","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIS.2009.137","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5222860","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Triplet Based Multi-core Interconnection Network and its Computational Efficiency","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5222951","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-3 June 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5222951/","displayDocTitle":"Triplet Based Multi-core Interconnection Network and its Computational Efficiency","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10859643","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5222951/","conferenceDate":"1-3 June 2009","dateOfInsertion":"25 August 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Triplet Based Multi-core Interconnection Network and its Computational Efficiency","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"3641a516.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.038326S","chronDate":"1-3 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5222859","isNumber":"5222860","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5222859","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5222860","articleId":"5222951","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5222972,"authors":[{"name":"Dapeng Zhang","affiliation":["School of Electronic Engineering and Computer Science, Queen''s Mary, University of London, UK"],"firstName":"Dapeng","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37537303000"},{"name":"Laurie Cuthbert","affiliation":["School of Electronic Engineering and Computer Science, Queen''s Mary, University of London, UK"],"firstName":"Laurie","lastName":"Cuthbert","id":"37279686900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-3667-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5222972","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":81},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Mesh networks","Routing protocols","Broadcasting","Computer science","Streaming media","Computer architecture","Design engineering","Robustness","Telecommunication standards","Multimedia systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["frequency division multiple access","OFDM modulation","quality of service","telecommunication network routing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["QoS","guaranteed joint design","subcarrier allocation","OFDMA","wireless mesh networks","node-disjoint multipath routing protocol"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["WMN","OFDMA","NDMR","QoS"]}],"abstract":"Wireless Mesh Networks based on OFDMA and the Node-Disjoint Multipath Routing Protocol (NDMR) can provide practical high-speed broadband and robust transmission.

MIMO is an established standard in the WIMAX family, however practical literature on the exploitation of MIMO in WIMAX networks focused on treating the paradoxical situation of demand for line of sight (LOS) in microwave communications against the essential MIMO prerequisite, i.e., the Non LOS (NLOS) and multi fade paths. This framework proposes a novel approach to exploit potentials of MIMO in WIMAX networks. This is achieved by exploiting spatial diversity of multiple antenna sites (MAS) to create artificial NLOS environment, whereby, MAS(s) are encapsulated as antennas in a large scale frame. This presents a significant enhancement of the existing schemes, which highlighted the exploitation of the combination of time division duplexing (TDD), orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM), and MIMO for multiple access points (MAP(s)) in a single frequency network (SFN). In this paper, the network is divided into layers and the above exploitation of MIMO is realised between these layers in a network-to-network communication scenario. The resulting network is characterized by high capacities at distribution access points and ease of design by virtue of combination of SFN and spatial techniques.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A WIMAX MIMO Network Architecture Exploiting Spatial Diversity of Multiple Antenna Sites","publicationTitle":"2009 Second International Conference on Advances in Mesh Networks","doi":"10.1109/MESH.2009.21","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Second International Conference on Advances in Mesh Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/5222955/5222956/05222986.pdf","startPage":"79","endPage":"84","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MESH.2009.21","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5222956","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5222986","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5222986/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-23 June 2009","displayDocTitle":"A WIMAX MIMO Network Architecture Exploiting Spatial Diversity of Multiple Antenna Sites","conferenceDate":"18-23 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5222986/","dateOfInsertion":"25 August 2009","publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10860080","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A WIMAX MIMO Network Architecture Exploiting Spatial Diversity of Multiple Antenna Sites","confLoc":"Athens, Greece","sourcePdf":"3667a079.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053744S","chronDate":"18-23 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5222955","isNumber":"5222956","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5222955","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5222956","articleId":"5222986","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5222987,"authors":[{"name":"Tiankui Zhang","affiliation":["School of Information and Communication Engineering, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Tiankui","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37288850400"},{"name":"Lin Xiao","affiliation":["Electronic Engineering and Computer Science, Queen''s Mary, University of London, London, UK"],"firstName":"Lin","lastName":"Xiao","id":"37635674700"},{"name":"Chunyan Feng","affiliation":["School of Information and Communication Engineering, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Chunyan","lastName":"Feng","id":"37289215100"},{"name":"Laurie Cuthbert","affiliation":["Electronic Engineering and Computer Science, Queen''s Mary, University of London, London, UK"],"firstName":"Laurie","lastName":"Cuthbert","id":"37279686900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-3667-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5222987","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":96},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Relays","Diversity reception","Scheduling algorithm","Throughput","Error analysis","Performance analysis","Diversity methods","Frequency conversion","Wireless networks","Fading"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","diversity reception","frequency division multiple access","OFDM modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiuser diversity","cooperative relay","relay stations","relay link users","maximal ratio combining","multiuser scheduling","Max C/I algorithm","proportional fairness","user fairness","cooperation diversity gain","orthogonal frequency division multiple access","cellular radio"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["orthogonal frequency division multiple accesses","ralay","multiuser diversity","cooperation diversity"]}],"abstract":"In cooperation relay system, two relay stations transmit cooperatively for the relay link users, and the relay link users receive signal by maximal ratio combining.

In this paper, we proposed a pricing mechanism which combines the mechanism design with the opportunistic scheduling algorithm and ensures that each rational selfish user maximizes his own utility function, at the same time optimizing the overall system utility. The proposed pricing mechanism is based on the classic Vickrey-Clark-Groves (VCG) mechanism and had several desirable economic properties.

Identification of micro level color variations further contemplates on the cancer growth based on the underlying principles of Shewhartpsilas control charts, which focus on the fact that the variability does exist in all repetitive processes. The heterogeneous color variation within the skin is considered as an assignable cause and is due to the secretion of excess melanin. These variations possess greater magnitude as compared to the chance causes due to the color variations found in normal skins. The power of control chart that lies in its ability to separate out this assignable cause, which is one of inherent mnemonics of Malignant Melanoma, is exhibited. The proposed technique identifies the normal skin region from the regions of lesions, the incidence and propagation of cancer; besides detecting its fuzzy border. Results show that the method produces robust border detection and the micro level cancer propagation found in the affected region.","doi":"10.1109/ICIS.2009.142","publicationTitle":"2009 Eighth IEEE/ACIS International Conference on Computer and Information Science","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Eighth IEEE/ACIS International Conference on Computer and Information Science","pdfPath":"/iel5/5222859/5222860/05223022.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIS.2009.142","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5222860","startPage":"586","endPage":"592","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Border Detection and Cancer Propagation on Spectral Bands of Malignant Melanoma Using Six Sigma Threshold","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5223022","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Border Detection and Cancer Propagation on Spectral Bands of Malignant Melanoma Using Six Sigma Threshold","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-3 June 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5223022/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"1-3 June 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10846594","dateOfInsertion":"25 August 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5223022/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Border Detection and Cancer Propagation on Spectral Bands of Malignant Melanoma Using Six Sigma Threshold","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"3641a586.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055576S","chronDate":"1-3 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5222859","isNumber":"5222860","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5222859","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5222860","articleId":"5223022","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5223044,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaoli Ye","affiliation":["Department electronics, University of Nanchang, Nanchang, China"],"firstName":"Xiaoli","lastName":"Ye","id":"37690212400"},{"name":"Qinwu Lai","affiliation":["Department electronics, University of Nanchang, Nanchang, China"],"firstName":"Qinwu","lastName":"Lai","id":"37901175200"},{"name":"Rongling Chen","affiliation":["Department electronics, University of Nanchang, Nanchang, China"],"firstName":"Rongling","lastName":"Chen","id":"37068008600"},{"name":"Zao Xu","affiliation":["Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Nanjing, Jiangsu, China"],"firstName":"Zao","lastName":"Xu","id":"37894082100"},{"name":"Xiangqun Ye","affiliation":["School of foreign language studies, University of Nanchang, Nanchang, China"],"firstName":"Xiangqun","lastName":"Ye","id":"37893857300"},{"name":"Dongxiang Luo","affiliation":["School of foreign language studies, University of Nanchang, Nanchang, China"],"firstName":"Dongxiang","lastName":"Luo","id":"37903319700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3619-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5223044","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":87},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Finite difference methods","Time domain analysis","Linux","Concurrent computing","Parallel processing","Electromagnetic scattering","Boundary conditions","Magnetic fields","Libraries","Intelligent networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["finite difference time-domain analysis","Linux","message passing","parallel processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FDTD parallel performance","Linux","PC cluster system","finite difference time domain algorithm","message passing","parallel computing system","electromagnetic wave scattering","dielectric layer scattering"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["MPI","finite difference time domain(FDTD)","COW","region division","parallel computing(key words)"]}],"abstract":"This paper describes the parallelizing algorithm of finite difference time domain(FDTD), which is realized by a method based on Message Passing on the parallel computing system of COW constituted by high-performance PC through network.

This paper is to present our investigations of the behaviors of the MIMO ultra-wide-band-impulse radio (UWB-IR) systems with statistic models, which will contribute to optimal designs for the low-power high-speed data communication over unlicensed bandwidth spanning several GHz, such as IEEE 802.15 families. We have developed and analyzed three no coherent transceiver models without requiring any channel estimation procedure. The massive simulations are made based on our established models. Our investigations show that the Poisson distribution of the path arriving will affect the signal-noise ratio (SNR) and that for the Nakagami distributed multipath fading channel the \"m\" factor, together with receiver number, will impact on the SNR of the MIMO UWB-IR systems.","doi":"10.1109/ICIS.2009.121","publicationTitle":"2009 Eighth IEEE/ACIS International Conference on Computer and Information Science","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Eighth IEEE/ACIS International Conference on Computer and Information Science","pdfPath":"/iel5/5222859/5222860/05223065.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIS.2009.121","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5222860","startPage":"791","endPage":"796","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Degradation of MIMO UWB-IR Transceiver in Poisson Models","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5223065","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Degradation of MIMO UWB-IR Transceiver in Poisson Models","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-3 June 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5223065/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"1-3 June 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10846604","dateOfInsertion":"25 August 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5223065/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Degradation of MIMO UWB-IR Transceiver in Poisson Models","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"3641a791.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.07549S","chronDate":"1-3 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5222859","isNumber":"5222860","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5222859","xplore-issue":"5222860","articleId":"5223065","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5223071,"authors":[{"name":"Min Zhang","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Information Engineering, South China University of Technology, China"],"firstName":"Min","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37677412400"},{"name":"Shengming Jiang","affiliation":["Faculty of Advanced Technology, University of Glamorgan, UK","School of Electronic and Information Engineering, South China University of Technology, China"],"firstName":"Shengming","lastName":"Jiang","id":"37279382800"},{"name":"Gang Wei","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Information Engineering, South China University of Technology, China"],"firstName":"Gang","lastName":"Wei","id":"37281335200"},{"name":"Hongjiang Wang","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Information Engineering, South China University of Technology, China"],"firstName":"Hongjiang","lastName":"Wang","id":"37292555300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3641-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5223071","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":110},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Performance analysis","Cognitive radio","Traffic control","Delay","Frequency","Random processes","Computer networks","Information science","Telecommunication traffic","Radio network"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","frequency allocation","Markov processes","telecommunication traffic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["network performance analysis","cognitive radio network","secondary user policy","packet generation","Markov model","packet loss ratio","packet delay","spectrum utilization","traffic load"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cognitive radio networks","secondary user policies","packet loss and delay","spectrum utilization","Markov model"]}],"abstract":"In a cognitive radio network (CRN), instead of direct leaving, an interrupted secondary user (SU) is suspended to wait for another channel.

The approach is a new Smith predictor combined with fuzzy radial basis function neural network (FRBFNN) control. It can identify the controlled plant and adaptively adjusts weights of the controller. Because new Smith predictor hides predictor model of the network delay into real network data transmission process, further the network delay no longer needs to be measured, identified or estimated on-line. Simultaneously, this new Smith predictor doesnpsilat include the prediction model of the controlled plant, thus it doesnpsilat need to know the exact mathematical model of the controlled plant beforehand. Thus, it is applicable to some occasions that network delays are the random, time-variant or uncertain, possibly large compared to one, even tens sampling periods, and there are data dropouts in the closed loop.

The algorithm is iterative: combined sequential and parallel processing is employed to accelerate execution. When a neuron satisfies the square template, the pixel corresponding to this neuron will be noted during the process and be deleted until the end of the iteration; on the other hand, if a neuron meets a triangle template, it will be removed directly. In addition, this proposed algorithm can be effective for fingerprint thinning without considering the direction. The results showed that, with combined sequential and parallel conditions for border pixels removal, the algorithm could not only speed up the fingerprint thinning process, but also be applied to other common images. Furthermore, this algorithm might be applied to fingerprint identification systems to save time for identifying and eliminating spurious minutiae.","doi":"10.1109/ICIS.2009.132","publicationTitle":"2009 Eighth IEEE/ACIS International Conference on Computer and Information Science","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Eighth IEEE/ACIS International Conference on Computer and Information Science","pdfPath":"/iel5/5222859/5222860/05223107.pdf","startPage":"115","endPage":"119","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIS.2009.132","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5222860","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5223107","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Novel Approach Based on PCNNs Template for Fingerprint Image Thinning","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-3 June 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5223107/","displayDocTitle":"A Novel Approach Based on PCNNs Template for Fingerprint Image Thinning","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5223107/","publicationDate":"June 2009","dateOfInsertion":"25 August 2009","conferenceDate":"1-3 June 2009","accessionNumber":"10846627","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Novel Approach Based on PCNNs Template for Fingerprint Image Thinning","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"3641a115.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063758S","chronDate":"1-3 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5222859","isNumber":"5222860","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5222859","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5222860","articleId":"5223107","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5223123,"authors":[{"name":"Yujun Bao","affiliation":["Information Institute of Southwest, Southwest University of Science and Technology, MianYang, China"],"firstName":"Yujun","lastName":"Bao","id":"37670100800"},{"name":"Hong Jiang","affiliation":["Information Institute of Southwest, Southwest University of Science and Technology, MianYang, China"],"firstName":"Hong","lastName":"Jiang","id":"37532166700"},{"name":"Yuqing Huang","affiliation":["Information Institute of Southwest, Southwest University of Science and Technology, MianYang, China"],"firstName":"Yuqing","lastName":"Huang","id":"37536899900"},{"name":"Rongchun Hu","affiliation":["Information Institute of Southwest, Southwest University of Science and Technology, MianYang, China"],"firstName":"Rongchun","lastName":"Hu","id":"37892063400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3641-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5223123","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":315},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5223123","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power control","Resource management","Wireless networks","Cloning","Immune system","Bandwidth","Genetic algorithms","Testing","Frequency","Computer networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","genetic algorithms","power control","resource allocation","telecommunication congestion control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiobjective optimization","power control","resource allocation","cognitive wireless networks","multiobjective immune cloning genetic algorithm","external memory immune operator","cloning operator","bandwidth-footprint product"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["cognitive network","immunization","cloning","multi-objective optimization"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICIS.2009.17","pdfPath":"/iel5/5222859/5222860/05223123.pdf","publicationTitle":"2009 Eighth IEEE/ACIS International Conference on Computer and Information Science","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Eighth IEEE/ACIS International Conference on Computer and Information Science","startPage":"70","endPage":"74","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5222860","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIS.2009.17","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multi-objective Optimization of Power Control and Resource Allocation for Cognitive Wireless Networks","abstract":"Resource optimization is a very important aspect in cognitive radio network (CRN).

To evaluate the performance of MMGA, we compare it to NSGA-II with three typical test functions. From the results, the MMGA can solve multi-objective optimization problems more effectively than the NSGA-II.

DPA considers the relevance between input samples space and the IF-part parameters, which intends to accomplish coarse adjustment. Then, GSE is adopted to search the global optimum solution.

The K-nearest neighbor method is a popular way for the collaborative filtering realizations. Its key technique is to find k nearest neighbors for a given user to predict his interests. However, most collaborative filtering algorithms suffer from data sparsity which leads to inaccuracy of recommendation. Aiming at the problem of data sparsity for collaborative filtering, a collaborative filtering algorithm based on BP neural networks is presented. This method uses the BP neural networks to fill the vacant ratings at first, then uses collaborative filtering to form nearest neighborhood, and lastly generates recommendations. The collaborative filtering based on BP neural networks smoothing can produce more accuracy recommendation than the traditional method.","doi":"10.1109/IUCE.2009.121","pdfPath":"/iel5/5222864/5222865/05223176.pdf","startPage":"234","endPage":"236","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Symposium on Intelligent Ubiquitous Computing and Education","publicationTitle":"2009 International Symposium on Intelligent Ubiquitous Computing and Education","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IUCE.2009.121","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5222865","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The Collaborative Filtering Recommendation Algorithm Based on BP Neural Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5223176/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-16 May 2009","displayDocTitle":"The Collaborative Filtering Recommendation Algorithm Based on BP Neural Networks","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"25 August 2009","accessionNumber":"10860014","publicationDate":"May 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5223176/","conferenceDate":"15-16 May 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Collaborative Filtering Recommendation Algorithm Based on BP Neural Networks","confLoc":"Chengdu, China","sourcePdf":"3619a234.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.116463S","chronDate":"15-16 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5222864","isNumber":"5222865","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5222864","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"5222865","articleId":"5223176","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5223188,"authors":[{"name":"Gan Kim Soon","affiliation":["School of Engineering and Information Technology, Universiti Malaysia Sabah, Kota Kinabalu, Sabah, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Gan Kim","lastName":"Soon","id":"37691498200"},{"name":"Patricia Anthony","affiliation":["School of Engineering and Information Technology, Universiti Malaysia Sabah, Kota Kinabalu, Sabah, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Patricia","lastName":"Anthony","id":"37395258300"},{"name":"Jason Teo","affiliation":["School of Engineering and Information Technology, Universiti Malaysia Sabah, Kota Kinabalu, Sabah, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Jason","lastName":"Teo","id":"37312201700"},{"name":"Chin Kim On","affiliation":["School of Engineering and Information Technology, Universiti Malaysia Sabah, Kota Kinabalu, Sabah, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Chin Kim","lastName":"On","id":"37304084200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3619-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5223188","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":96},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Genetic algorithms","Genetic engineering","Information technology","Protocols","Decision making","Autonomous agents","Monitoring","Evolutionary computation","Genetic mutations","Intelligent agent"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decision making","electronic commerce","genetic algorithms","mobile agents"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bidding strategies","self-adaptation genetic algorithm","configurable heuristic decision making","flexible heuristic decision making","autonomous agent","online auction"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Online Auction","Bidding Strategies","Bidding Agent","Genetic Algorithm","Self-Adaptation"]}],"doi":"10.1109/IUCE.2009.108","publicationTitle":"2009 International Symposium on Intelligent Ubiquitous Computing and Education","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Symposium on Intelligent Ubiquitous Computing and Education","pdfPath":"/iel5/5222864/5222865/05223188.pdf","startPage":"222","endPage":"225","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5222865","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IUCE.2009.108","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5223188","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Evolving Bidding Strategies Using Self-Adaptation Genetic Algorithm","abstract":"This paper investigates the application of self-adaptation genetic algorithm on a flexible and configurable heuristic decision making framework that can tackle the problem of bidding across multiple auctions that apply different protocols (English, Vickrey and Dutch) by using an autonomous agent to search for the most effective strategies (offline).

Redundant representation of partial products and remainders is common in the multiplication and division hardware algorithms, respectively. Carry-free implementation of the more frequent add/subtract operations, with the byproduct of enhancing the speed of multiplication and division, is possible with redundant number representation. However, conversion of redundant results to conventional representations entails slow carry propagation that can be avoided if the results are kept in redundant format for later use as operands of other arithmetic operations. Given that redundant decimal representations, contrary to redundant binary, do not necessarily require extra storage, we are motivated to develop a framework for fully redundant decimal arithmetic, where all operands and results belong to the same redundant decimal number system and can be stored and later used as operands of further decimal operations. In this paper, we present a new faster decimal signed digit add/sub unit and show how it can be efficiently used in the design of decimal multipliers and dividers, where all operands and results are represented with the same redundant digit set [-7, 7].","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fully Redundant Decimal Arithmetic","publicationTitle":"2009 19th IEEE Symposium on Computer Arithmetic","doi":"10.1109/ARITH.2009.23","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 19th IEEE Symposium on Computer Arithmetic","pdfPath":"/iel5/5223291/5223292/05223339.pdf","startPage":"145","endPage":"152","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ARITH.2009.23","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5223292","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5223339","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5223339/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 June 2009","displayDocTitle":"Fully Redundant Decimal Arithmetic","conferenceDate":"8-10 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5223339/","dateOfInsertion":"25 August 2009","publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10844947","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fully Redundant Decimal Arithmetic","confLoc":"Portland, OR, USA","sourcePdf":"3670a145.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.07354S","chronDate":"8-10 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5223291","isNumber":"5223292","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5223291","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"5223292","articleId":"5223339","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":5223393,"authors":[{"name":"Weihua Wang","affiliation":["School of Computer, Chongqing University of Arts and Sciences, Chongqing, China"],"firstName":"Weihua","lastName":"Wang","id":"37578736700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3619-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5223393","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":14,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":564},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5223393","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Licenses","Radial basis function networks","Pattern recognition","Neural networks","Vehicles","Target recognition","Monitoring","Sensor systems","Spline","Shape measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["object recognition","radial basis function networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["license plate recognition algorithm","radial basis function neural networks","automatic target recognition","vehicle license plate feature","image-size","hidden layer neural nodes"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["license plate","classifier","radial basis function","neural networks","recognition pattern"]}],"doi":"10.1109/IUCE.2009.20","pdfPath":"/iel5/5222864/5222865/05223393.pdf","publicationTitle":"2009 International Symposium on Intelligent Ubiquitous Computing and Education","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Symposium on Intelligent Ubiquitous Computing and Education","startPage":"38","endPage":"41","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5222865","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IUCE.2009.20","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"License Plate Recognition Algorithm Based on Radial Basis Function Neural Networks","abstract":"Automatic license plate recognition is an important form in the automatic target recognition.

In addition, the authors propose an architectural model of Self Managed Security Cell, which leverages on current knowledge in large scale security systems, information management and autonomous systems.","doi":"10.1109/AFIN.2009.15","publicationTitle":"2009 First International Conference on Advances in Future Internet","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 First International Conference on Advances in Future Internet","pdfPath":"/iel5/5223375/5223376/05223407.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/AFIN.2009.15","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5223376","startPage":"47","endPage":"52","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Self Managed Security Cell, a Security Model for the Internet of Things and Services","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5223407","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Self Managed Security Cell, a Security Model for the Internet of Things and Services","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-23 June 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5223407/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"18-23 June 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10844971","dateOfInsertion":"25 August 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5223407/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Self Managed Security Cell, a Security Model for the Internet of Things and Services","confLoc":"Athens/Glyfada, Greece","sourcePdf":"3664a047.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063331S","chronDate":"18-23 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5223375","isNumber":"5223376","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5223375","citationCount":"34","xplore-issue":"5223376","articleId":"5223407","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5223500,"authors":[{"name":"Gkhan Apaydin","affiliation":["Applied Research and Development, University of Technology, Zurich, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Gkhan","lastName":"Apaydin","id":"37888494000"},{"name":"Levent Sevgi","affiliation":["Electronics and Communications Engineering Department, Dogus University, Istanbul, Turkey"],"firstName":"Levent","lastName":"Sevgi","id":"37273499500"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1536-1225"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1548-5757"}],"articleNumber":"5223500","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":28,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":337},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society","url":"http://www.ieeeaps.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Surface waves","Propagation losses","Mathematical model","Predictive models","Surface fitting","Analytical models","Attenuation","Finite element methods","Testing","Frequency"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["finite element analysis","HF radio propagation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["surface wave multimixed-path propagator","FEM","path loss prediction","finite element method","surface wave propagation prediction simulator","analytical ray-mode model","Millington recovery effect","HF frequency band","MF frequency band"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["finite element method (FEM)","Millington effect","mixed-path propagation","surface waves"]}],"abstract":"A finite element method (FEM)-based surface wave propagation prediction simulator is developed.

In computer vision, many models have been proposed to simulate the behavior of eyes such as SaliencyToolBox (STB), Neuromorphic Vision Toolkit (NVT), and others, but they demand high computational cost and computing useful results mostly relies on their choice of parameters. Although some region-based approaches were proposed to reduce the computational complexity of feature maps, these approaches still were not able to work in real time. Recently, a simple and fast approach called spectral residual (SR) was proposed, which uses the SR of the amplitude spectrum to calculate the image's saliency map. However, in our previous work, we pointed out that it is the phase spectrum, not the amplitude spectrum, of an image's Fourier transform that is key to calculating the location of salient areas, and proposed the phase spectrum of Fourier transform (PFT) model. In this paper, we present a quaternion representation of an image which is composed of intensity, color, and motion features. Based on the principle of PFT, a novel multiresolution spatiotemporal saliency detection model called phase spectrum of quaternion Fourier transform (PQFT) is proposed in this paper to calculate the spatiotemporal saliency map of an image by its quaternion representation. Distinct from other models, the added motion dimension allows the phase spectrum to represent spatiotemporal saliency in order to perform attention selection not only for images but also for videos. In addition, the PQFT model can compute the saliency map of an image under various resolutions from coarse to fine. Therefore, the hierarchical selectivity (HS) framework based on the PQFT model is introduced here to construct the tree structure representation of an image. With the help of HS, a model called multiresolution wavelet domain foveation (MWDF) is proposed in this paper to improve coding efficiency in image and video compression. Extensive tests of videos, natural images, and psychological patterns show that the proposed PQFT model is more effective in saliency detection and can predict eye fixations better than other state-of-the-art models in previous literature. Moreover, our model requires low computational cost and, therefore, can work in real time. Additional experiments on image and video compression show that the HS-MWDF model can achieve higher compression rate than the traditional model.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5223506/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 August 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"19","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"15 December 2009","accessionNumber":"11020087","htmlLink":"/document/5223506/","pubMedId":"19709976","displayDocTitle":"A Novel Multiresolution Spatiotemporal Saliency Detection Model and Its Applications in Image and Video Compression","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Novel Multiresolution Spatiotemporal Saliency Detection Model and Its Applications in Image and Video Compression","sourcePdf":"18tip12-cguo-2030969.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.123923S","chronDate":"Jan.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"83","isNumber":"5353839","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"596","xplore-issue":"5353839","articleId":"5223506","onlineDate":"25 August 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5223520,"authors":[{"name":"Tingting Chen","affiliation":["Computer Science and Engineering Department, State University of New York, University at Buffalo, Buffalo, NY, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/72/5280548/5223520/5223520-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Tingting Chen received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in computer science from the Department of Computer Science and Technology, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China, in 2004 and 2006, respectively.

We present results on a systematic investigation of the influence of the periodically loaded lossy dielectric on the propagation characteristics of the operating modes, which reveals that a complex mode in the periodic system can be mapped to a corresponding mode in an empty waveguide or a uniform DL waveguide. Dielectric losses not only induce modal transitions between different modes with similar field structures and close phase velocities in the uniform system but also unify the discrete mode spectrum into a continuous spectrum in the periodic system. Since the lossy dielectric functions as a power sink, the higher order Bloch harmonic components arising from the structural periodicity are suppressed, and the mode spectrum of the lossy periodic system degenerates into that of an empty waveguide. This alleviates the potential danger of spurious oscillations induced by the higher order harmonic components, making the periodic lossy DL waveguide promising in a high-power millimeter-wave gyro-TWT.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 August 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5223531/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2009","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"56","issue":"10","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"18 September 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5223531/","accessionNumber":"10878823","displayDocTitle":"A Lossy Dielectric-Ring Loaded Waveguide With Suppressed Periodicity for Gyro-TWTs Applications","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Lossy Dielectric-Ring Loaded Waveguide With Suppressed Periodicity for Gyro-TWTs Applications","sourcePdf":"ted-du-2028384.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.057548S","chronDate":"Oct.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"16","isNumber":"5247140","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"27","xplore-issue":"5247140","articleId":"5223531","onlineDate":"25 August 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":5223533,"authors":[{"name":"Lili Wang","affiliation":["Shanghai Key Laboratory of Contemporary Applied Mathematics and Key Laboratory of Nonlinear Science of Chinese Ministry of Education, School of Mathematical Sciences, Fudan University, Shanghai, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/72/5280548/5223533/5223533-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Lili Wang received the B.S. degree in applied mathematics from Qufu Normal University, Qufu, China, in 2004.

According to the conventional methods, a single step size for a whole circuit is selected for the numerical integration. A real-power electronic system, however, is multirate in that its currents and voltages nonuniformly vary spatially and temporally, and its subcircuits have different transient rates. A simulation that selected an appropriate step size for each subcircuit independently would, therefore, be more efficient. Several multirate analysis techniques have already been proposed; this paper proposes a new method that divides the whole circuit into subcircuits by applying an explicit integration formula to series inductors and/or parallel capacitors, and then integrates subcircuits by applying an implicit formula with independent integration step sizes. As analysis examples, this method is applied to an ac-dc converter, a benchmark test circuit, and a dc-link inverter control system. The proposed method's effectiveness at reducing computational steps and CPU times is investigated, and its performance and efficiency are validated.","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2009.2030959","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/63/5361389/05223535.pdf","startPage":"2791","endPage":"2802","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2009.2030959","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5361389","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multirate Analysis Method for a Power Electronic System by Circuit Partitioning","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5223535","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 August 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5223535/","displayDocTitle":"Multirate Analysis Method for a Power Electronic System by Circuit Partitioning","volume":"24","issue":"12","publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","accessionNumber":"11024955","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5223535/","dateOfInsertion":"28 December 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multirate Analysis Method for a Power Electronic System by Circuit Partitioning","sourcePdf":"tpel-kato-2030959.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.079459S","chronDate":"Dec.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"5361389","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"34","xplore-issue":"5361389","articleId":"5223535","onlineDate":"25 August 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5223548,"authors":[{"name":"Beibei Zhang","affiliation":["ECE Department, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD, USA"],"firstName":"Beibei","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37715347300"},{"name":"Jacob B.

By acquiring radio-frequency (RF) frames at very high frame rates (390-520 Hz), the onset of small, localized, transient deformations resulting from the electrical activation of the heart, i.e., generating the electromechanical wave (EMW), can be mapped. The correlation between the EMW and the electrical activation speed and pacing scheme has previously been reported. In this study, we pursue the development of EWI using both displacements and strains and analysis of the EMW properties in dogs \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">in vivo</i>\n for early detection of ischemia. EWI was performed in normal and ischemic open-chest dogs during sinus rhythm. Ischemia of increasing severity was obtained by gradually obstructing the left-anterior descending (LAD) coronary artery flow. We also introduce the novel method of motion-matching that achieves the reconstruction of the full EWI cine-loop at very high frame rates even when the ECG may be irregular or unavailable. Incremental displacements were previously used by our group to map the EMW. This paper focuses on the associated incremental strains, which facilitate the interpretation of the EMW by relating it directly to contraction. Moreover, we define the onset of the EMW as the time, at which the incremental strains change sign after the onset of the QRS complex of the ECG. Based on this definition, isochronal representations of the EMW were generated using a semi-automated method. The isochronal representation of the EMW during sinus rhythm was reproducible and shown similar to electrical activation maps previously reported in the literature. After segmentation using a contour-tracking method, the two- and four-chamber views were imaged and displayed in bi-plane views, allowing a 3-D interpretation of the EMW. EWI was shown to be sensitive to the presence of intermediate ischemia. EWI localized the ischemic region when the LAD flow was obstructed at 60% and beyond and was capable of mapping the increase of the ischemic region size as the LAD occlusion level increased. In conclusion, the activation maps and wave patterns obtained with EWI were similar to the electrical equivalents previously reported in the literature. Moreover, EWI was found to be sensitive enough to detect and map intermediate ischemia. Those results indicate that EWI could be used to assess the conduction properties of the myocardium, and detect its ischemic onset and disease progression entirely noninvasively.","doi":"10.1109/TMI.2009.2030186","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","pdfPath":"/iel5/42/5423284/05223577.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5423284","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMI.2009.2030186","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","startPage":"625","endPage":"635","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Electromechanical Wave Imaging of Normal and Ischemic Hearts <emphasis emphasistype=\"italic\">In Vivo</emphasis>","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5223577","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 August 2009","displayDocTitle":"Electromechanical Wave Imaging of Normal and Ischemic Hearts <emphasis emphasistype=\"italic\">In Vivo</emphasis>","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5223577/","volume":"29","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/5223577/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2010","accessionNumber":"11152907","pubMedId":"19709966","dateOfInsertion":"01 March 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Electromechanical Wave Imaging of Normal and Ischemic Hearts <emphasis emphasistype=\"italic\">In Vivo</emphasis>","sourcePdf":"tmi-jprovost-2030186.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.101132S","chronDate":"March  2010","xplore-pub-id":"42","isNumber":"5423284","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"42","citationCount":"64","xplore-issue":"5423284","articleId":"5223577","onlineDate":"25 August 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5223580,"authors":[{"name":"Peng Chen","affiliation":["Institute of Advanced Digital Technologies and Instrumentation, University of Zhejiang, Hangzhou, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/19/5374018/5223580/5223580-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Peng Chen was born in Zhejiang Province, China, in 1981.

Optimizing the PSC geometries to maximize the power transfer efficiency of the wireless link is imperative to reduce the size of the external energy source, heating of the tissue, and interference with other devices. Implantable devices need to be hermetically sealed in biocompatible materials and placed in a conductive environment with high permittivity (tissue), which can affect the PSC characteristics. We have constructed a detailed model that includes the effects of the surrounding environment on the PSC parasitic components and eventually on the power transfer efficiency. We have combined this model with an iterative design method that starts with a set of realistic design constraints and ends with the optimal PSC geometries.

The stereo rig is linearly calibrated online with at least two steps of unspecific motions of the robot. A mixed visual control method is then proposed to guide the end-effector to approach the target, whose robustness and efficiency are improved by taking the advantage of both position-based and image-based visual control methods.

The instrument operation is based on stochastic analog-to-digital (A/D) conversion and accumulation, with a novel hardware structure tailored for harmonic measurements. A theoretical approach in determining measurement uncertainty is first presented, and the accuracy trends with varying signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) are then analyzed. Using this theoretical analysis, the relative standard uncertainty of measurement is found to be 0.32% at <formula formulatype=\"inline\"><tex Notation=\"TeX\">$-$</tex></formula>10-dB SNR and less than 0.01% at 20-dB SNR. The method and the predicted uncertainty for 50 harmonics are first validated by simulation. The proposed technique is then implemented into a newly developed prototype instrument that was coupled with a coreless current measurement transformer. Calibration shows high linearity of the coreless transformer and, hence, of the whole instrument in a wide range of primary signals. Experimental results, which measure low-level and highly distorted currents, confirm both the theory and simulation. </para>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5223597/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 August 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2009","volume":"58","issue":"10","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"11 September 2009","accessionNumber":"10864296","publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5223597/","isStaticHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A Novel Method for Stochastic Measurement of Harmonics at Low Signal-to-Noise Ratio","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Novel Method for Stochastic Measurement of Harmonics at Low Signal-to-Noise Ratio","sourcePdf":"tim-sokola-2017661.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.064865S","chronDate":"Oct.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"19","isNumber":"5235148","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"19","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"5235148","articleId":"5223597","onlineDate":"25 August 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":5223603,"authors":[{"name":"Jeffrey H.

Recent development of nonclassical light sources-whose photodetection statistics require the use of quantum theory-plus increasing interest in optics-based approaches to quantum information processing necessitates a thorough understanding of the similarities and distinctions between the semiclassical and quantum theories of optical communications. This paper is addressed to that need, focusing, for convenience, on the free-space communication channel using Gaussian states of light. The quantum version of the Huygens-Fresnel diffraction integral is reviewed, along with the semiclassical and quantum theories of direct, homodyne, and heterodyne detection. Maximally entangled Gaussian state light is used, in conjunction with quantum photodetection theory, to explain the nonclassical effects seen in Hong-Ou-Mandel interferometry and violation of the Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt form of Bell's inequality. The classical information capacities of several bosonic channels are reviewed, and shown to exceed what can be achieved using conventional optical receivers.","doi":"10.1109/JSTQE.2009.2024959","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSTQE.2009.2024959","startPage":"1547","endPage":"1569","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Quantum Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Quantum Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/2944/5340088/05223603.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5340088","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The Quantum Theory of Optical Communications","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5223603/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.-dec.  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 August 2009","displayDocTitle":"The Quantum Theory of Optical Communications","volume":"15","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"04 December 2009","accessionNumber":"11004961","publicationDate":"Nov.-dec. 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5223603/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Quantum Theory of Optical Communications","sourcePdf":"jstqe-shapiro-2024959.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.143956S","chronDate":"Nov.-dec.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"2944","isNumber":"5340088","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"2944","citationCount":"89","xplore-issue":"5340088","articleId":"5223603","onlineDate":"25 August 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5223605,"authors":[{"name":"Jiho Han","affiliation":["Seoul National University, Seoul, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/19/5374018/5223605/5223605-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jiho Han (S'08) was born in Seoul, Korea, in 1979.

The circuit consists of four novel inductively peaked cascode gain cells, which are capacitively coupled to the base line for power optimization and bandwidth enhancement. Due to the tapered collector line, no output termination resistor is required, which provides higher efficiency. Design tradeoffs for maximum bandwidth, gain, output power, and efficiency are discussed by means of analytical calculations and simulations. A gain of 11 dB with a gain flatness of plusmn1 dB has been measured over a frequency range from 1 to 12 GHz. 19.5-dBm output power is obtained at the 1-dB compression point (P\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1 dB</sub>\n) in the desired frequency range with an associated power-added efficiency of 22.1% and a maximum output third-order intercept point of 31.5 dBm. The power dissipation of the amplifier is 400 mW from a 5-V supply. On-chip biasing is implemented via low dropout voltage reference driven by a bandgap voltage source.

By using multiple apertures in azimuth, additional samples are received for each transmitted pulse. This allows for a reduced pulse repetition frequency (PRF) thereby enabling a wider swath. However, a nonoptimum PRF is associated with a nonuniform sample spacing in azimuth and needs to be compensated by a multichannel reconstruction algorithm. For strong deviations from the optimum PRF, the inverse character of such an algorithm might result in a degraded performance. This can be overcome by an innovative advanced transmit antenna architecture which allows for a pulse-to-pulse shift of the phase center. Such an antenna enables the adaptive adjustment of the system's phase center positions to the respective PRF, thereby ensuring constant performance over a clearly extended PRF range. In particular, in combination with conventional multichannel processing strategies, this technique represents the next step toward a fully active multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) SAR and has a great potential for future systems.","doi":"10.1109/LGRS.2009.2025245","publicationTitle":"IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters","pdfPath":"/iel5/8859/5278412/05223615.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LGRS.2009.2025245","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5278412","startPage":"782","endPage":"786","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Azimuth Phase Center Adaptation on Transmit for High-Resolution Wide-Swath SAR Imaging","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5223615","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Azimuth Phase Center Adaptation on Transmit for High-Resolution Wide-Swath SAR Imaging","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5223615/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 August 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"6","issue":"4","publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","accessionNumber":"10930259","dateOfInsertion":"13 October 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5223615/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Azimuth Phase Center Adaptation on Transmit for High-Resolution Wide-Swath SAR Imaging","sourcePdf":"lgrs-gebert-2025245.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.039463S","chronDate":"Oct.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"8859","isNumber":"5278412","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8859","citationCount":"39","xplore-issue":"5278412","articleId":"5223615","onlineDate":"25 August 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5223616,"authors":[{"name":"Bruno Allard","affiliation":["Universit\u00e9 de Lyon, Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, UMR 5005, Villeurbanne, France"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/5361389/5223616/5223616-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Bruno Allard (M\u201993\u2013SM\u201902) was born in 1965.

Numerous methods for the construction of compact thermal models have been presented in this paper. Few of them propose state-space models, where the model order can be controlled according to the necessity of the virtual prototyping analyses. Moreover, the model reduction methods require the experience of the engineer and previous calibration. Diffusive representation (DR) is proposed here as an original and efficient method to build compact thermal models as state-space models. The model reduction is obtained through the model parameter identification and/or the time horizon of the measurement data provided for the identification. Instead of eigenvalue elimination, the method enables to specify adequately inside the model the frequency domain wished for the virtual analysis at hand. The proposed method is particularly dedicated to the system optimization phases. Experimental and simulation results are in good agreement. The advantages and limitations of the DR are discussed in comparison to published methods.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/63/5361389/05223616.pdf","startPage":"2833","endPage":"2846","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2009.2028231","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2009.2028231","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5361389","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5223616","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reduced-Order Thermal Behavioral Model Based on Diffusive Representation","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Virtual prototyping","Reduced order systems","Power electronics","Electrothermal effects","Design engineering","Calibration","Parameter estimation","Time measurement","Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","Frequency domain analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power convertors","power engineering computing","state-space methods","thermal analysis","virtual prototyping"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["reduced-order thermal behavioral model","diffusive representation","power electronic converters","electrothermal models","state-space models","virtual prototyping analyses","model reduction methods","eigenvalue elimination","frequency domain","virtual analysis"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Diffusive representation (DR)","electrothermal effects","reduced-order systems"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5223616/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 August 2009","displayDocTitle":"Reduced-Order Thermal Behavioral Model Based on Diffusive Representation","volume":"24","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/5223616/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","accessionNumber":"11024948","dateOfInsertion":"28 December 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reduced-Order Thermal Behavioral Model Based on Diffusive Representation","sourcePdf":"tpel-allard-2028231.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.114121S","chronDate":"Dec.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"5361389","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"5361389","articleId":"5223616","onlineDate":"25 August 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5223623,"authors":[{"name":"Yao Ma","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Iowa State University, Ames, IA, USA"],"firstName":"Yao","lastName":"Ma","id":"37274225200"},{"name":"Dongbo Zhang","affiliation":["Qualcomm, Inc., San Diego, CA, USA","Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Iowa State University, Ames, IA, USA"],"firstName":"Dongbo","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37291864900"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9545"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1939-9359"}],"articleNumber":"5223623","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":12,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":538},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Vehicular Technology Society","url":"http://www.vtsociety.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fading","Autocorrelation","Rayleigh channels","Nakagami distribution","Computational modeling","Discrete Fourier transforms","Distribution functions","Availability","Digital communication","Transceivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Nakagami channels","Rayleigh channels","time series","transceivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["complex Nakagami fading time series","channel simulation technique","digital radio transceivers","wireless channels","Nakagami- m fading signals","nonuniform phase distributions","prespecified temporal autocorrelation function","cumulative distribution function mapping method","complex Gaussian sequences","complex Nakagami sequences","Rayleigh fading signals"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Channel simulator","Gaussian fading spectrum","Jakes' model","Nakagami channels","phase distribution"]}],"abstract":"The availability of an accurate and systematic channel simulation technique is critical for the verification of the performance of digital radio transceivers designed for use on wireless channels.

Additionally, we analyze the relationships between the autocorrelation functions of Rayleigh and Nakagami fading signals to determine the autocorrelation function of Rayleigh input that is required to produce a specified autocorrelation function for the Nakagami output. Then, we implement the mapping algorithm to transform Rayleigh sequences with the so-determined autocorrelation functions into Nakagami sequences with the desired prespecified autocorrelation functions.

Shannon in 1948, channel capacity has been regarded as the fundamental information-theoretic performance measure to predict the maximum information rate of a communication system. However, in contrast with the analysis of other important performance measures of wireless communication systems, a unified and general approach for computing the channel capacity over fading channels has yet to be proposed. Motivated by this consideration, we propose a novel and unified communication-theoretic framework for the analysis of channel capacity over fading channels. It is shown that the framework can handle various fading channel models, communication types, and adaptation transmission policies. In particular, the specific contributions of this paper are as follows: (1) We introduce a transform operator, called the \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">E</i>\n \n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">i</sub>\n-transform, which is shown to provide a unified tool to compute the channel capacity with either side information at the receiver or side information at the transmitter and the receiver, directly from the moment-generating function (MGF) or the MGF and the truncated MGF of the Signal-to-Noise-Ratio (SNR) at the receiver, respectively; (2) we show that when either a channel inversion or a truncated channel inversion adaptation policy is considered, the channel capacity can readily be computed from the Mellin or the Hankel transform of the MGF of the received SNR, respectively; (3) a simple yet effective numerical method for the analysis of higher order statistics (HOS) of the channel capacity with side information at the receiver is introduced; and (4) some efficient and ad hoc numerical methods are explicitly introduced to allow the efficient computation of the proposed frameworks. Numerical and simulation results are also shown and compared to substantiate the analytical derivation.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5223626/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 August 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2010","publicationDate":"Jan. 2010","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"15 January 2010","accessionNumber":"11070329","volume":"59","issue":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Channel Capacity Over Generalized Fading Channels: A Novel MGF-Based Approach for Performance Analysis and Design of Wireless Communication Systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Channel Capacity Over Generalized Fading Channels: A Novel MGF-Based Approach for Performance Analysis and Design of Wireless Communication Systems","sourcePdf":"tvt-direnzo-2030894.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.083198S","chronDate":"Jan.  2010","isNumber":"5383378","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"105","articleId":"5223626","onlineDate":"25 August 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5223629,"authors":[{"name":"Yusuke Nasu","affiliation":["NTT Photonics Laboratories, Atsugi, Kanagawa, Japan"],"bio":{"p":["Yusuke Nasu (M'05) was born in Okayama, Japan, on March 17, 1978.

The PDf has a detrimental effect on the demodulation performance of a DQPSK signal, and it is degraded by various kinds of PLC fabrication errors. In this paper, we focus on the polarization crosstalk in the coupler, which is one of the main causes of PDf. To eliminate such PDf, we controlled both the position of the half-wave plate in the MZI and the polarization of the propagated light. We describe the principle of this PDf reduction method in detail and provide a theoretical and experimental discussion. In addition, we describe a compact DQPSK demodulator composed of a single MZI based DQPSK demodulator with a 90-degree optical hybrid. This demodulator configuration can reduce the receiver's footprint. Finally we achieved a compact DQPSK demodulator with a low PDf of less than 0.10 GHz in the L-band.","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/50/5282655/05223629.pdf","startPage":"5348","endPage":"5355","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","doi":"10.1109/JLT.2009.2030898","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JLT.2009.2030898","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5282655","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5223629","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Asymmetric Half-Wave Plate Configuration of PLC Mach\u2013Zehnder Interferometer for Polarization Insensitive DQPSK Demodulator","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optical retarders","Programmable control","Demodulation","Optical polarization","Frequency","Degradation","Fabrication","Crosstalk","Lighting control","Optical propagation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["demodulators","differential phase shift keying","light polarisation","light propagation","Mach-Zehnder interferometers","optical couplers","optical crosstalk","optical fabrication","optical modulation","optical receivers","optical retarders","programmable controllers","quadrature phase shift keying"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["half-wave plate configuration","PLC Mach-Zehnder interferometer","polarization insensitive DQPSK demodulator fabrication","polarization dependent frequency shift reduction method","silica-based PLC DQPSK demodulator","propagated light polarization","90-degree optical hybrid","incident SOP","coupler polarization crosstalk","detrimental effect","error-free demodulation","receiver footprint reduction","bit rate 43 Gbit/s"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["DQPSK","planar wave guides","silica-based wave guides"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5223629/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.1,  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 August 2009","displayDocTitle":"Asymmetric Half-Wave Plate Configuration of PLC Mach\u2013Zehnder Interferometer for Polarization Insensitive DQPSK Demodulator","volume":"27","issue":"23","htmlLink":"/document/5223629/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec.1, 2009","accessionNumber":"10916416","dateOfInsertion":"09 October 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Asymmetric Half-Wave Plate Configuration of PLC Mach\u2013Zehnder Interferometer for Polarization Insensitive DQPSK Demodulator","sourcePdf":"jlt-ynasu-2030898.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.079252S","chronDate":"Dec.1,  2009","xplore-pub-id":"50","isNumber":"5282655","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"5282655","articleId":"5223629","onlineDate":"25 August 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5223632,"authors":[{"name":"Jing-ling Yang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/92/5471724/5223632/5223632-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jing-ling Yang (M'08) received the B.Sc. degree in automation from Tsinghua University, Tsinghua, China, in 1988 and the Ph.D. degree in electronic engineering from The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, in 2001.","She was a Lecturer with the Institute of Microelectronics, Tsinghua University, in 1992-1997, a Senior Engineer with Motorola Hong Kong Limited, in 2000-2002.

Larger test data size demands not only higher memory requirements, but also an increase in testing time. Test data compression addresses this problem by reducing the test data volume without affecting the overall system performance. This paper proposes a novel test data compression technique using bitmasks which provides a substantial improvement in the compression efficiency without introducing any additional decompression penalty. The major contributions of this paper are as follows: 1) it develops an efficient bitmask selection technique for test data in order to create maximum matching patterns; 2) it develops an efficient dictionary selection method which takes into account the bitmask based compression; and 3) it proposes a test compression technique using efficient dictionary and bitmask selection to significantly reduce the testing time and memory requirements. We have applied our method on various test data sets and compared our results with other existing test compression techniques. Our algorithm outperforms existing dictionary-based approaches by up to 30%, giving a best possible test compression of 92%.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/92/5556483/05223633.pdf","startPage":"1277","endPage":"1286","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","doi":"10.1109/TVLSI.2009.2024116","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVLSI.2009.2024116","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5556483","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5223633","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Test Data Compression Using Efficient Bitmask and Dictionary Selection Methods","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Test data compression","Dictionaries","Circuit testing","System testing","Pattern matching","Built-in self-test","Logic testing","System-on-a-chip","Circuit faults","Decoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data compression","Huffman codes","runlength codes","system-on-chip"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["test data compression","efficient bitmask","dictionary selection methods","system-on-chip designs","matching patterns"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Bitmasks","decompression","test compression"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5223633/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 August 2009","displayDocTitle":"Test Data Compression Using Efficient Bitmask and Dictionary Selection Methods","volume":"18","issue":"9","htmlLink":"/document/5223633/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","accessionNumber":"11477336","dateOfInsertion":"23 August 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Test Data Compression Using Efficient Bitmask and Dictionary Selection Methods","sourcePdf":"tvlsi-kbasu-2024116-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.067184S","chronDate":"Sept.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"92","isNumber":"5556483","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"39","xplore-issue":"5556483","articleId":"5223633","onlineDate":"25 August 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5223636,"authors":[{"name":"Kazuteru Namba","affiliation":["Graduate School of Advanced Integration Science, Chiba University, Chiba, Japan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/92/5556483/5223636/5223636-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Kazuteru Namba (M'03) received the B.E., M.E., and Ph.D. degrees from the Tokyo Institute of Technology, Tokyo, Japan, in 1997, 1999, and 2002, respectively.","He joined Chiba University, Chiba, Japan, in 2002.

In addition, the occurrence of delay faults caused by manufacturing defects is a significant problem. Thus, SEU tolerant design and delay fault testing are of increasing significance. This paper presents two types of SEU tolerant flip-flops (FFs). The proposed FFs tolerate SEUs caused by particles striking feedback loops in the FFs. Moreover, the proposed FFs allow enhanced scan delay fault testing. The proposed FFs are master-slave FFs, and the slave latches are constructed by modifying existing SEU tolerant latches, namely, SEH latches. The two proposed FFs tolerate particles with charges of 370 fC and of 369 fC or lower, whereas an existing SEU tolerant enhanced scan FF, called an ESFF-SEC, tolerates those of 431 fC or lower. Furthermore, the areas of the proposed FFs are 23.1% and 20.5% smaller than that of the ESFF-SEC. The CK-Q delay times are 44.4% and 41.1% shorter than that of the ESFF-SEC. Moreover, the average power consumptions of the proposed FFs during system operations are 55.6% and 53.3% lower than that of the ESFF-SEC.","doi":"10.1109/TVLSI.2009.2022083","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/92/5556483/05223636.pdf","startPage":"1265","endPage":"1276","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVLSI.2009.2022083","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5556483","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Construction of SEU Tolerant Flip-Flops Allowing Enhanced Scan Delay Fault Testing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5223636","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 August 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5223636/","displayDocTitle":"Construction of SEU Tolerant Flip-Flops Allowing Enhanced Scan Delay Fault Testing","volume":"18","issue":"9","publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","accessionNumber":"11477337","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5223636/","dateOfInsertion":"23 August 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Construction of SEU Tolerant Flip-Flops Allowing Enhanced Scan Delay Fault Testing","sourcePdf":"tvlsi-knamba-2022083-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.086067S","chronDate":"Sept.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"92","isNumber":"5556483","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"26","xplore-issue":"5556483","articleId":"5223636","onlineDate":"25 August 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5223639,"authors":[{"name":"Ludovic Goux","affiliation":["Inter University Micro Electronics Center, Leuven, Belgium"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/16/5247140/5223639/5223639-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Ludovic Goux received the M.

In such a system, several multiantenna base stations (BSs) are organized in a cellular architecture to serve multiantenna mobile stations (MSs) and are connected to a central service unit via a high-speed wired backbone. To improve the network performance, a novel PHY layer design is proposed that allows cooperation among an arbitrary and unknown number of BSs by suitably randomizing the MIMO-OFDM block codes used by the BSs. Such a randomized MIMO-OFDM code renders the encoding/decoding rule independent of the number of actual BSs cooperating and works without any channel feedback, which greatly simplifies the protocol as well as the MS design. To provide performance insights and develop PHY layer designs, this paper provides analytical upper bounds on the symbol error probability for linear receivers, which allow to accurately evaluate the diversity order and the coding gain achievable through the proposed scheme. Lastly, we present numerical results that validate the theory, and highlight the performance gain and the coverage expansion attainable with our cooperative transceiver.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/5353758/05223642.pdf","startPage":"384","endPage":"402","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2009.2030837","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2009.2030837","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5353758","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5223642","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cooperative Randomized MIMO-OFDM Downlink for Multicell Networks: Design and Analysis","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Downlink","Physical layer","MIMO","Performance gain","Frequency division multiplexing","OFDM","IP networks","Large-scale systems","Base stations","Spine"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decoding","encoding","MIMO communication","multifrequency antennas","OFDM modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cooperative randomized MIMO-OFDM downlink","multicell networks","low-complexity physical layer design","multiple-input multiple-output","orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing network","multiantenna base stations","multiantenna mobile stations","high-speed wired backbone","decoding rule","error probability","coding gain","encoding rule"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cooperative downlink","infrastructured multicell networks","minimum mean-square error (MMSE) linear decoding","multiple-input multiple-output orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (MIMO-OFDM) technology","physical (PHY) layer design","randomized space-time block coding (STBC)","zero-forcing (ZF) linear decoding"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5223642/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 August 2009","displayDocTitle":"Cooperative Randomized MIMO-OFDM Downlink for Multicell Networks: Design and Analysis","volume":"58","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/5223642/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2010","accessionNumber":"11020533","dateOfInsertion":"15 December 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cooperative Randomized MIMO-OFDM Downlink for Multicell Networks: Design and Analysis","sourcePdf":"58tsp01-fverde-2030837.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.140178S","chronDate":"Jan.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"5353758","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"5353758","articleId":"5223642","onlineDate":"25 August 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5223647,"authors":[{"name":"Chung-Ching Peng","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Florida, Gainesville, USA"],"firstName":"Chung-Ching","lastName":"Peng","id":"37577414300"},{"name":"Zhiming Xiao","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Florida, Gainesville, USA"],"firstName":"Zhiming","lastName":"Xiao","id":"37869912500"},{"name":"Rizwan Bashirullah","affiliation":["Dept. of Electr. & Comput.

Due to inherent limitations of commonly used freehand needle placement techniques, there is a need for a system providing for controlled needle steering for procedures that demand high positional accuracy. This paper describes a robotic system developed for flexible needle steering inside soft tissues under real-time ultrasound imaging. An inverse kinematics algorithm based on a virtual spring model is applied to calculate needle base manipulations required for the tip to follow a curved trajectory while avoiding physiological obstacles. The needle tip position is derived from ultrasound images and is used in calculations to minimize the tracking error, enabling a closed-loop needle insertion. In addition, as tissue stiffness is a necessary input to the control algorithm, a novel method to classify tissue stiffness from localized tissue displacements is proposed and shown to successfully distinguish between soft and stiff tissue. The system performance was experimentally verified by robotic manipulation of the needle base inside a phantom with layers of varying stiffnesses. The closed-loop experiment with updated tissue stiffness parameters demonstrated a needle-tip tracking error of ~ 1 mm and proved to be significantly more accurate than the freehand method.","doi":"10.1109/TBME.2009.2030169","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/10/5437399/05223650.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TBME.2009.2030169","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5437399","startPage":"799","endPage":"805","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Ultrasound-Guided Robot for Flexible Needle Steering","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5223650","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Ultrasound-Guided Robot for Flexible Needle Steering","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5223650/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 August 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"57","issue":"4","publicationDate":"April 2010","accessionNumber":"11206224","pubMedId":"19709957","dateOfInsertion":"22 March 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5223650/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Ultrasound-Guided Robot for Flexible Needle Steering","sourcePdf":"tbme-neubach-2030169.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.067115S","chronDate":"April  2010","xplore-pub-id":"10","isNumber":"5437399","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"73","xplore-issue":"5437399","articleId":"5223650","onlineDate":"25 August 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5223652,"authors":[{"name":"Yaniv Zigel","affiliation":["Biomedical Signal Processing Research Laboratory, Ben-Gurion University, Beer-Sheva, Israel"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/10/5336631/5223652/5223652-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yaniv Zigel (S'96\u2013M'03) was born in Tel-Aviv, Israel, in 1970.

Rapid detection of fall events can reduce the rate of mortality and raise the chances to survive the event and return to independent living. In the last two decades, several technological solutions for detection of falls were published, but most of them suffer from critical limitations. In this paper, we present a proof of concept to an automatic fall detection system for elderly people. The system is based on floor vibration and sound sensing, and uses signal processing and pattern recognition algorithm to discriminate between fall events and other events. The classification is based on special features like shock response spectrum and mel frequency ceptral coefficients. For the simulation of human falls, we have used a human mimicking doll: ldquoRescue Randy.rdquo The proposed solution is unique, reliable, and does not require the person to wear anything. It is designed to detect fall events in critical cases in which the person is unconscious or in a stress condition. From the preliminary research, the proposed system can detect human mimicking dolls falls with a sensitivity of 97.5% and specificity of 98.6%.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Method for Automatic Fall Detection of Elderly People Using Floor Vibrations and Sound\u2014Proof of Concept on Human Mimicking Doll Falls","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","doi":"10.1109/TBME.2009.2030171","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/10/5336631/05223652.pdf","startPage":"2858","endPage":"2867","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TBME.2009.2030171","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5336631","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5223652","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5223652/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 August 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2009","displayDocTitle":"A Method for Automatic Fall Detection of Elderly People Using Floor Vibrations and Sound\u2014Proof of Concept on Human Mimicking Doll Falls","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"56","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/5223652/","dateOfInsertion":"20 November 2009","publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","accessionNumber":"10985006","pubMedId":"19709955","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Method for Automatic Fall Detection of Elderly People Using Floor Vibrations and Sound\u2014Proof of Concept on Human Mimicking Doll Falls","sourcePdf":"tbme-gannot-2030171.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.081593S","chronDate":"Dec.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"10","isNumber":"5336631","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"224","xplore-issue":"5336631","articleId":"5223652","onlineDate":"25 August 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5223662,"authors":[{"name":"Samer Banna","affiliation":["Etch Division, RF and Plasma Technology Group, Applied Materials, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/27/5234049/5223662/5223662-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Samer Banna received the B.Sc., M.Sc., and Ph.D. degrees (with distinction) from the Technion-Israel Institute of Technology, Haifa, Israel, in 1997, 2000, and 2004, respectively.","After his graduate studies, he was engaged in research for one year as a Postdoctoral Research Associate with the Technion-Israel Institute of Technology on the design of future optical acceleration structures.

It is demonstrated that one can control the etching uniformity and profile in advanced gate etching, and reduce the leakage current by varying the synchronous pulsed plasma parameters. Moreover, it is shown that synchronous pulsing has the promise of significantly reducing the electron shading effects compared with source pulsing mode and continuous-wave mode.

Our novel method uses bootstrap resampling. It is very general, applicable to almost any registration method based on minimizing a pixel-based similarity criterion; we demonstrate it using the SSD, SAD, correlation, and mutual information criteria. We show experimentally that the bootstrap method provides better estimates of the registration accuracy than the state-of-the-art Cramer-Rao bound method. Additionally, we evaluate also a fast registration accuracy estimation (FRAE) method which is based on quadratic sensitivity analysis ideas and has a negligible computational overhead. FRAE mostly works better than the Cramer-Rao bound method but is outperformed by the bootstrap method.","doi":"10.1109/TIP.2009.2030955","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIP.2009.2030955","startPage":"64","endPage":"73","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/83/5353839/05223699.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5353839","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Bootstrap Resampling for Image Registration Uncertainty Estimation Without Ground Truth","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 August 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2010","displayDocTitle":"Bootstrap Resampling for Image Registration Uncertainty Estimation Without Ground Truth","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"15 December 2009","volume":"19","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5223699/","accessionNumber":"11020086","pubMedId":"19709978","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5223699/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Bootstrap Resampling for Image Registration Uncertainty Estimation Without Ground Truth","sourcePdf":"18tip12-jkybic-2030955.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.09689S","chronDate":"Jan.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"83","isNumber":"5353839","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"68","xplore-issue":"5353839","articleId":"5223699","onlineDate":"25 August 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":5223703,"authors":[{"name":"Joohan Lee","affiliation":["GSI Group, Inc., Bedford, MA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/66/5291681/5223703/5223703-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Joohan Lee (M'96) received the B.S. degree in chemical engineering from Yonsei University, Seoul, Korea, in 1996, and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in chemical engineering from the University of Maryland, College Park, in 1999 and 2001, respectively.","He is currently employed at GSI Group, Bedford, MA.

Shrinking design rules in IC fabrication have necessitated decreased fuse pitches in the redundancy circuitry. Current infrared lasers are facing the 2 mum pitch barrier due to the diffraction limited spot size and depth of focus capabilities. In this paper, we present experimental results showing how we have achieved successful laser cut processes of future metal fuse structures down to 1.0 mum pitch using a combination of the small spot of short wavelength laser and the polarization effect to tightly pitched neighbor structures. Inline polarization with link length minimizes the adjacent link damages and thus improves the energy process window for robust cutting. Electrical measurement data of metal link structures with various pitches, metal width and top passivation thicknesses shows the importance of controlling of top oxide thickness on the fine pitch structure. This enabling technology provides a viable production solution for laser fuse processing down to 45-nm node technology and below.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5223703/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 August 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2009","volume":"22","issue":"4","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10957857","dateOfInsertion":"03 November 2009","publicationDate":"Nov. 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5223703/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Polarization Effect in Laser Processing of Fine Pitch Link Structures for Advanced Memory Designs","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Polarization Effect in Laser Processing of Fine Pitch Link Structures for Advanced Memory Designs","sourcePdf":"tsm-jlee-2031010.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.098848S","chronDate":"Nov.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"66","isNumber":"5291681","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"66","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5291681","articleId":"5223703","onlineDate":"25 August 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5223705,"authors":[{"name":"Martin O.

OSA is a common sleep disorder produced by repetitive occlusions in the upper airways and this phenomenon can usually be observed also in other peripheral systems such as the cardiovascular system. Then the extraction of ECG characteristics, such as the RR intervals and the area of the QRS complex, is useful to evaluate the sleep apnea in noninvasive way. In the presented analysis, 50 recordings coming from the apnea Physionet database were used; data were split into two sets, the training and the testing set, each of which was composed of 25 recordings. A bivariate time-varying autoregressive model (TVAM) was used to evaluate beat-by-beat power spectral densities for both the RR intervals and the QRS complex areas. Temporal and spectral features were changed on a minute-by-minute basis since apnea annotations where given with this resolution. The training set consisted of 4950 apneic and 7127 nonapneic minutes while the testing set had 4428 apneic and 7927 nonapneic minutes. The K-nearest neighbor (KNN) and neural networks (NN) supervised learning classifiers were employed to classify apnea and non apnea minutes. A sequential forward selection was used to select the best feature subset in a wrapper setting. With ten features the KNN algorithm reached an accuracy of 88%, sensitivity equal to 85%, and specificity up to 90%, while NN reached accuracy equal to 88%, sensitivity equal to 89% and specificity equal to 86%. In addition to the minute-by-minute classification, the results showed that the two classifiers are able to separate entirely (100%) the normal recordings from the apneic recordings. Finally, an additional database with eight recordings annotated as normal or apneic was used to test again the classifiers. Also in this new dataset, the results showed a complete separation between apneic and normal recordings.","doi":"10.1109/TBME.2009.2029563","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/10/5336631/05223705.pdf","startPage":"2838","endPage":"2850","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TBME.2009.2029563","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5336631","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sleep Apnea Screening by Autoregressive Models From a Single ECG Lead","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5223705","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 August 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5223705/","displayDocTitle":"Sleep Apnea Screening by Autoregressive Models From a Single ECG Lead","volume":"56","issue":"12","publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","accessionNumber":"10985001","pubMedId":"19709961","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5223705/","dateOfInsertion":"20 November 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sleep Apnea Screening by Autoregressive Models From a Single ECG Lead","sourcePdf":"tbme-mendez-2029563.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.109289S","chronDate":"Dec.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"10","isNumber":"5336631","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"95","xplore-issue":"5336631","articleId":"5223705","onlineDate":"25 August 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-22"},{"_id":5223713,"authors":[{"name":"Andrea Paoli","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering and Computer Science, University of Trento, Trento, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/36/5332061/5223713/5223713-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Andrea Paoli received the M.Sc. degree in telecommunications engineering from the University of Trento, Trento, Italy, in 2008.","He is currently a Project Engineer for a telecommunications company in Milan, Italy.

The analysis of the bit-error-rate performance shows that the CPolSK system has about a 3 dB lower requirement in signal-to-noise ratio than the on-off keying system. The modulation scheme will be helpful for practical free-space optical communication systems in the future.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5223759/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 August 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"September  2009","publicationDate":"September 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5223759/","dateOfInsertion":"22 September 2009","accessionNumber":"10879895","volume":"1","issue":"4","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Circle Polarization Shift Keying With Direct Detection for Free-Space Optical Communication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Circle Polarization Shift Keying With Direct Detection for Free-Space Optical Communication","sourcePdf":"307.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.083067S","chronDate":"September  2009","xplore-pub-id":"4563700","isNumber":"5256115","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4563700","citationCount":"25","xplore-issue":"5256115","articleId":"5223759","onlineDate":"25 August 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5223760,"authors":[{"name":"Surinder Singh","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, Sant Longowal Institute of Engineering and Technology, Longowal, Punjab, India"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4563700/5256115/5223760/5223760-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Surinder Singh was born in Hoshiarpur (Punjab), India, on December 27, 1975.

It can be used with common frequency division multiple access (FDMA), time division multiple access (TDMA) or code division multiple access (CDMA) techniques. Main terrestrial communication standards already implement SDMA. SDMA basically relies on adaptive and dynamic beam-forming associated to a clever algorithm in charge of resource allocation. As satellite communication systems move towards an increasing number of users and a larger throughput for each of them, SDMA is one of the most promising techniques that can reach these two goals. This paper studies static frequency allocation problems (FAP) in a satellite communication system involving a gateway connected to a terrestrial network and some user terminals located in a service area. Two scenarios are considered: one based on SDMA and the other based on usual spot coverage. We propose original integer linear programming formulations and greedy allocation algorithms for the FAP which involve unusual cumulative interference constraints. By considering the link budget of each user, the objective is to maximize the number of users that the system can serve. We show through computational experiments on realistic data that the FAP associated with the SDMA system can be solved efficiently, yielding substantial improvement compared to the traditional system.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Radio spectrum management","Multiaccess communication","Satellite communication","Financial advantage program","Resource management","Time division

Short-term forecasting is the key to the success of transportation operations planning such as time-tabling and seat allocation. This study adopts neural networks to develop short-term passenger demand forecasting models to be used in operational management of light rail services. A multi-layer perceptron (MLP) model is preferred due to not only its simple architecture but also proven success of solving approximation problems. For eliminating the significant seasonality in time slots, each time slot is handled independent of the others, and an artificial neural network based on daily data is developed for each. Regarding to the 74 different time slots, 74 different neural networks are trained by history data. Three illustrative examples are demonstrated on one of the time slots and performance of the forecast models are evaluated based on mean square errors (MSE) and mean absolute percentage errors (MAPE).","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-9 July 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5223851/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10845235","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5223851/","publicationDate":"July 2009","dateOfInsertion":"25 August 2009","conferenceDate":"6-9 July 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Light rail passenger demand forecasting by artificial neural networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Light rail passenger demand forecasting by artificial neural networks","confLoc":"Troyes, France","sourcePdf":"371.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065862S","chronDate":"6-9 July 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5191362","isNumber":"5223483","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5191362","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5223483","articleId":"5223851","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5223982,"authors":[{"name":"Henry Lowood","affiliation":["University of Stanford, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Henry Lowood is curator for History of Science and Technology Collections in the Stanford University Libraries.

The proposed torque-sharing functions are dependent on the turn-on angle, overlap angle, and the expected torque. This study shows that for a given torque the turn-on angle and the overlap angle have significant effects upon speed range, maximum speed, copper loss, and efficiency. Hence, genetic algorithm is used to optimize the turn-on angle and the overlap angle at various expected torque demands operating under the proposed TRM control in order to maximize the speed range and minimize the copper loss. Furthermore, four torque-sharing functions are used to derive the optimized results. At the same time, a fast and accurate online approach to compute the optimal turn-on and overlap angles is proposed. Therefore, this paper provides a valuable method to improve the performances of switched reluctance motor drives operating under TRM control.","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2009.2019581","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/63/5210216/05223997.pdf","startPage":"2076","endPage":"2090","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2009.2019581","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5210216","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimization and Evaluation of Torque-Sharing Functions for Torque Ripple Minimization in Switched Reluctance Motor Drives","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5223997","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 August 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5223997/","displayDocTitle":"Optimization and Evaluation of Torque-Sharing Functions for Torque Ripple Minimization in Switched Reluctance Motor Drives","volume":"24","issue":"9","publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"10860123","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5223997/","dateOfInsertion":"25 August 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimization and Evaluation of Torque-Sharing Functions for Torque Ripple Minimization in Switched Reluctance Motor Drives","sourcePdf":"tpel-cheng-2019581.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.071822S","chronDate":"Sept.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"5210216","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"208","xplore-issue":"5210216","articleId":"5223997","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5224001,"authors":[{"name":"Gong-Ru Lin","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/3/5175612/5224001/5224001-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Gong-Ru Lin (M'93\u2013SM'04) received the Ph.D. degree in electro-optical engineering from National Chiao Tung University, Taiwan, in 1996.","He directs the Laboratory of Fiber Laser Communications and Si Nano-Photonics with the Graduate Institute of Photonics and Optoelectronics, and Department of Electrical Engineering in National Taiwan University.

The variable-speed wind turbine driving a permanent-magnet synchronous generator is considered to be connected to the ac network through a fully controlled frequency converter. The detailed modeling and control strategy of the frequency converter as well as variable-speed operation of a wind turbine generator system are demonstrated. Afterward, a suitable and economical topology of ECS composed of a current-controlled voltage-source inverter, dc-dc buck/boost converter, and an electric double layer capacitor (EDLC) bank is presented, including their control strategies. Exponential moving average is used to generate the real input power reference of ECS. Another novel feature of this paper is the incorporation of a fuzzy-logic-controlled reference signal adjuster in the control of the dc-dc buck/boost converter, in which the stored energy of the EDLC bank is utilized in an efficient way. Due to this controller, the energy storage capacity of the EDLC bank can be reduced in size, thus resulting in reduction of the overall cost of the ECS unit as well as decrease in irrepressible operations during high and low energy levels of the EDLC bank. Finally, extensive simulation results are presented that validate the effectiveness of the proposed system to smoothen the output power fluctuation of the variable-speed wind farm.","doi":"10.1109/TEC.2009.2025323","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion","pdfPath":"/iel5/60/5224009/05224011.pdf","startPage":"740","endPage":"749","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5224009","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TEC.2009.2025323","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Geoscience"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 August 2009","displayDocTitle":"Integration of an Energy Capacitor System With a Variable-Speed Wind Generator","volume":"24","issue":"3","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5224011/","dateOfInsertion":"25 August 2009","publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"10841780","isJournal":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5224011/","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Integration of an Energy Capacitor System With a Variable-Speed Wind Generator","sourcePdf":"tec-muyeen-2025323.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.088395S","chronDate":"Sept.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"60","isNumber":"5224009","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"60","citationCount":"134","xplore-issue":"5224009","articleId":"5224011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-21"},{"_id":5224014,"authors":[{"name":"James W.

Power delivered from such DG sources depends on factors like energy availability and load demand. The converters used in power conversion do not operate with their full capacity all the time. The unused or remaining capacity of the converters could be used to provide some ancillary functions like harmonic and unbalance mitigation of the power distribution system. As some of these DG sources have wide operating ranges, they need special power converters for grid interfacing. Being a single-stage buck-boost inverter, recently proposed Z-source inverter (ZSI) is a good candidate for future DG systems. This paper presents a controller design for a ZSI-based DG system to improve power quality of distribution systems. The proposed control method is tested with simulation results obtained using Matlab/Simulink/PLECS and subsequently it is experimentally validated using a laboratory prototype.","doi":"10.1109/TEC.2009.2025318","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion","pdfPath":"/iel5/60/5224009/05224017.pdf","startPage":"695","endPage":"704","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TEC.2009.2025318","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5224009","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Z-Source-Inverter-Based Flexible Distributed Generation System Solution for Grid Power Quality Improvement","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5224017","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Geoscience"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 August 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5224017/","displayDocTitle":"Z-Source-Inverter-Based Flexible Distributed Generation System Solution for Grid Power Quality Improvement","volume":"24","issue":"3","publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"10846923","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5224017/","dateOfInsertion":"25 August 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Z-Source-Inverter-Based Flexible Distributed Generation System Solution for Grid Power Quality Improvement","sourcePdf":"tec-vilathgamuwa-2025318.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.059758S","chronDate":"Sept.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"60","isNumber":"5224009","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"60","citationCount":"113","xplore-issue":"5224009","articleId":"5224017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5224019,"authors":[{"name":"Andrew Kusiak","affiliation":["Intelligent Systems Laboratory, Department of Mechanical and Industrial Engineering, University of Iowa, Iowa, IA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/60/5224009/5224019/5224019-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Andrew Kusiak (M'90) received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in engineering from the Warsaw University of Technology, Warsaw, Poland, in 1972 and 1974, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree in operations research from the Polish Academy of Sciences, Warsaw, in 1979.","He is currently a Professor at the Intelligent Systems Laboratory, Department of Mechanical and Industrial Engineering, The University of Iowa, Iowa City.

Anticipatory control is based on the model predictive control (MPC) approach. Unlike the MPC method, noncontrollable variables (such as wind speed) are directly considered in the dynamic equations presented in the paper to predict response variables, e.g., rotor speed and turbine power output. To determine future states of the power drive with the dynamic equations, a time series model was built for wind speed. The time series model was fused with the dynamic equations to predict the response variables over a certain prediction horizon. Based on these predictions, an optimization model was solved to find the optimal control settings to improve the power output without incurring large rotor speed changes. As both the dynamic equations and time series model were built by data mining algorithms, no gradient information is available. A modified evolutionary strategy algorithm was used to solve a nonlinear constrained optimization problem. The proposed approach has been tested on the data collected from a 1.5 MW wind turbine.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Geoscience"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5224019/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 August 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5224019/","dateOfInsertion":"25 August 2009","publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"10846924","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"24","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Anticipatory Control of Wind Turbines With Data-Driven Predictive Models","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Anticipatory Control of Wind Turbines With Data-Driven Predictive Models","sourcePdf":"tec-kusiak-2025320.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.075313S","chronDate":"Sept.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"60","isNumber":"5224009","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"60","citationCount":"47","xplore-issue":"5224009","articleId":"5224019","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":5224114,"authors":[{"name":"Hala ElAarag","affiliation":["Department of Mathematics and Computer Science, Stetson University, Deland, FL, USA"],"firstName":"Hala","lastName":"ElAarag","id":"37298002800"},{"name":"Sam Romano","affiliation":["Department of Mathematics and Computer Science, Stetson University, Deland, FL, USA"],"firstName":"Sam","lastName":"Romano","id":"37885458400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4165-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-56555-328-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5224114","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":155},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Network servers","Frequency","Artificial neural networks","Costs","Function approximation","Mathematics","Computer science","Bandwidth","Aging"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cache storage","Internet","learning (artificial intelligence)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["NNPCR-2","neural network proxy cache replacement strategy","Web proxy servers","Squid","training neural networks","sliding window length","learning rate","Web proxy cache"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["web caching","proxy server","Squid","Neural network","NNPCR","cache replacement strategies"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5224114","abstract":"Proxy servers are designed with three goals: decrease bandwidth, lessen user perceived lag, and reduce loads on origin servers by caching copies of Web objects.

New applications are constantly appended into these devices. This work is aimed at emulating such devices using some benchmarks and observing the performance gains that can be achieved by modifications to the design of different hardware as well as software components. We present a modular environment where new tasks can be flexibly incorporated into the proposed framework. Leon-3 soft core microprocessor core and RTEMS real time operating system (RTOS) have been employed in the experiments. The system was implemented on a Xilinx FPGA and also tested using the TSIM2 simulator. Using this framework, we have demonstrated an example which optimizes time slices allocated by RTOS to different applications in an embedded device. In particular, we have shown that at a certain optimal value, the performance in terms of execution time attains a steady state. The framework can be extended to include a range of reconfigurable platforms, embedded processors, RTOS and corresponding applications.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Symposium on Performance Evaluation of Computer & Telecommunication Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5204040/5224098/05224146.pdf","startPage":"35","endPage":"40","publicationTitle":"2009 International Symposium on Performance Evaluation of Computer & Telecommunication Systems","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5224098","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5224146","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Framework for performance analysis of RTOS-enabled embedded systems on FPGA","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Performance analysis","Embedded system","Field programmable gate arrays","Application software","Performance gain","Hardware","Software performance","Microprocessors","Real time systems","Operating systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["embedded systems","field programmable gate arrays","microprocessor chips","operating systems (computers)","optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["RTOS-enabled embedded system","FPGA","field programmable gate array","software component","hardware component","Leon-3 soft core microprocessor core","RTEMS real time operating system","TSIM2 simulator","optimized time slice allocation","reconfigurable platform","embedded processor","performance analysis"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Reconfigurable Processor Cores","Instruction Set Simulation","RTOS","Embedded Systems","Real-time Performance"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5224146/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 July 2009","displayDocTitle":"Framework for performance analysis of RTOS-enabled embedded systems on FPGA","isConference":true,"volume":"41","htmlLink":"/document/5224146/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2009","accessionNumber":"10843559","dateOfInsertion":"28 August 2009","conferenceDate":"13-16 July 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Framework for performance analysis of RTOS-enabled embedded systems on FPGA","confLoc":"Istanbul, Turkey","sourcePdf":"010_36_Camera_Ready.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051693S","chronDate":"13-16 July 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5204040","isNumber":"5224098","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5204040","xplore-issue":"5224098","articleId":"5224146","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"SCS","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":5224175,"authors":[{"name":"C.

These methods are used in an Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) system. The OFDM employs orthogonal sub-carriers for data modulation. These sub-carriers unexpectedly present a large Peak to Average Power Ratio (PAPR) in some cases. In order to reduce PAPR, the sequence of input data is rearranged by PTS. The APPR method is also used to controls the peak level of modulation signals by an adaptive algorithm. A proposed reduction method consists of these two methods and realizes both advantages at the same time. In order to make the optimum condition on PTS for PAPR reduction, a quite large calculation cost must be demanded and thus it is impossible to obtain the optimum PTS. In the proposed method by using genetic algorithm, the total calculation cost becomes drastically reduced. The parameter for simulation used standard WLAN in IEEE 802.11a system. In simulation results, the proposed method shows the improvement on PAPR and also reveals the high performance on bit error rate (BER) of an OFDM system.","doi":"10.1109/CITISIA.2009.5224175","publicationTitle":"2009 Innovative Technologies in Intelligent Systems and Industrial Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Innovative Technologies in Intelligent Systems and Industrial Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5210013/5224158/05224175.pdf","startPage":"393","endPage":"397","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CITISIA.2009.5224175","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5224158","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Searching phase optimize in PTS-APPR method by GA for PAPR reduction in OFDM-WLAN systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5224175","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-26 July 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5224175/","displayDocTitle":"Searching phase optimize in PTS-APPR method by GA for PAPR reduction in OFDM-WLAN systems","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2009","accessionNumber":"10844636","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5224175/","conferenceDate":"25-26 July 2009","dateOfInsertion":"28 August 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Searching phase optimize in PTS-APPR method by GA for PAPR reduction in OFDM-WLAN systems","confLoc":"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"Paper78.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070674S","chronDate":"25-26 July 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5210013","isNumber":"5224158","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5210013","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"5224158","articleId":"5224175","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5224185,"authors":[{"name":"Filbert H.

So, classification of primary signals at secondary user receiver is needed to achieve these requirements of protection and support scalability. Scalability means changing operating parameters according to the current conditions which one of them is the primary signal that occupies the spectrum band. In this paper, we propose an approach to classify the primary signal either TV-PAL signal or wireless microphone signal using cyclostationary features in the context of IEEE 802.22 wireless regional area network (WRAN). The performance of the proposed approach is evaluated by probability of correct classification. This knowledge of identifying the primary signals can be applied for bandwidth scalability to use fractions of TV channel when it is occupied by wireless microphone signal. The results show that the proposed approach performs well in low signal-to-noise ratio (LSNR) and it is expected to increase the overall spectrum utilization of WRAN cognitive radio as well.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"25-26 July 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5224232/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"10844693","publicationDate":"July 2009","conferenceDate":"25-26 July 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5224232/","dateOfInsertion":"28 August 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Cognitive radio: Cyclostationarity-based classification approach for analog TV and wireless microphone signals","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cognitive radio: Cyclostationarity-based classification approach for analog TV and wireless microphone signals","confLoc":"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"Paper22.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059043S","chronDate":"25-26 July 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5210013","isNumber":"5224158","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5210013","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"5224158","articleId":"5224232","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5224249,"authors":[{"name":"J.

Abundant research has been done in using Neural Network for the problem of channel equalization. The classical gradient based methods suffer from the problem of getting trapped in local minima. And the stochastic methods which can give a global optimum solution need long computational times. In this paper a novel method in which the task of an equalizer is decentralized by using a FIR filter for studying the channel characteristics and RBF Neural Network for classifying the received data. In the results it can be observed that this method of equalization provides optimum performance, which can be obtained using Tabu Search. Also, since we are using FIR filter, training will be very faster and LMS algorithm is computationally very simple.","doi":"10.1109/CITISIA.2009.5224249","startPage":"11","endPage":"16","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Innovative Technologies in Intelligent Systems and Industrial Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5210013/5224158/05224249.pdf","publicationTitle":"2009 Innovative Technologies in Intelligent Systems and Industrial Applications","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CITISIA.2009.5224249","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5224158","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A highly efficient channel equalizer for digital communication system in Neural Network paradigm","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Digital communication","Neural networks","Finite impulse response filter","Adaptive equalizers","Clustering algorithms","Communication channels","Stochastic processes","Least squares approximation","Intersymbol interference","Intelligent systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["equalisers","FIR filters","radial basis function networks","search problems","telecommunication channels","telecommunication computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel equalizer","digital communication system","neural network paradigm","communication channels","RBF neural networks","gradient based methods","stochastic methods","FIR filter","tabu search","LMS algorithm"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5224249/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-26 July 2009","displayDocTitle":"A highly efficient channel equalizer for digital communication system in Neural Network paradigm","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5224249/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2009","dateOfInsertion":"28 August 2009","conferenceDate":"25-26 July 2009","accessionNumber":"10844710","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A highly efficient channel equalizer for digital communication system in Neural Network paradigm","confLoc":"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"Paper03.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052533S","chronDate":"25-26 July 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5210013","isNumber":"5224158","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5210013","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5224158","articleId":"5224249","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":5224281,"authors":[{"name":"Mable P.

The operating system produces liveness checks, embedded in the software clock, to which the guard can respond. We also present a novel method for the OS to detect a hardware-software (HW/SW) Trojan privilege escalation attack by using OS-generated checks to test if the CPU hardware is enforcing memory protection (MP).

For the larger circuits, our technique is able to magnify the power consumption of the tampered circuit by several times.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5224958","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Workshop on Hardware-Oriented Security and Trust","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Workshop on Hardware-Oriented Security and Trust","pdfPath":"/iel5/5209455/5224958/05224960.pdf","doi":"10.1109/HST.2009.5224960","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/HST.2009.5224960","startPage":"104","endPage":"107","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"VITAMIN: Voltage inversion technique to ascertain malicious insertions in ICs","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"27-27 July 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5224960/","displayDocTitle":"VITAMIN: Voltage inversion technique to ascertain malicious insertions in ICs","htmlLink":"/document/5224960/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"27-27 July 2009","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"10844394","dateOfInsertion":"28 August 2009","publicationDate":"July 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"VITAMIN: Voltage inversion technique to ascertain malicious insertions in ICs","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"rp0016-0019.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057931S","chronDate":"27-27 July 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5209455","isNumber":"5224958","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5209455","citationCount":"47","xplore-issue":"5224958","articleId":"5224960","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5224966,"authors":[{"name":"Devendra Rai","affiliation":["Charles L.

Most of the previously proposed Trojan detection methods rely on Trojan activation to either observe a faulty output or measure side-channel signals such as transient current or charge. From the authentication stand point, time to trigger a hardware Trojan circuit is a a major concern. This paper analyzes time to (i) generate a transition in functional Trojans and (ii) fully activate them. An efficient dummy flip-flop insertion procedure is proposed to increase Trojan activity. Depending on authentication time and circuit topology, a transition probability threshold is selected so that inserted dummy flip-flops would moderately impact area overhead. The simulation results on s38417 benchmark circuit demonstrate that, with a negligible area overhead, our proposed method can significantly increase Trojan activity and reduce Trojan activation time.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"27-27 July 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5224968/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5224968/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10844400","conferenceDate":"27-27 July 2009","publicationDate":"July 2009","dateOfInsertion":"28 August 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"New design strategy for improving hardware Trojan detection and reducing Trojan activation time","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"New design strategy for improving hardware Trojan detection and reducing Trojan activation time","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"rp0010-0037.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059711S","chronDate":"27-27 July 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5209455","isNumber":"5224958","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5209455","citationCount":"85","xplore-issue":"5224958","articleId":"5224968","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5224969,"authors":[{"name":"Andrea Candore","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering, University of Pisa, Pisa, Italy"],"firstName":"Andrea","lastName":"Candore","id":"37888052600"},{"name":"Ovunc Kocabas","affiliation":["Electrical and Engineering Department, Rice University, Houston, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Ovunc","lastName":"Kocabas","id":"37888052100"},{"name":"Farinaz Koushanfar","affiliation":["Electrical and Engineering Department, Rice University, Houston, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Farinaz","lastName":"Koushanfar","id":"37284705800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4805-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4804-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5224969","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":36,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":560},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5224969","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Robustness","Radiometry","Fingerprint recognition","Radiofrequency identification","Voting","Testing","Oscillators","Monitoring","Frequency","Phase modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fingerprint identification","maximum likelihood detection","packet radio networks","pattern classification","probability","radiofrequency identification","radiometry","security"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["radiometric fingerprinting","wireless devices","antenna","oscillator properties","digital interfaces","analog interfaces","radio packet monitoring","frequency offset","modulated phase offset","in-phase offset","quadrature-phase offset","classification technique","weighted voting","maximum likelihood","detection probability","false alarms probability","wireless security"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Wireless Security","RF Fingerprinting"]}],"abstract":"We introduce a new method for radiometric fingerprinting that detects the unique variations in the antenna, oscillator properties, as well as the digital and analog interfaces of the radio by passively monitoring the radio packets. Several individual identifiers are used for extracting the unique physical characteristics of the radio, including the frequency offset, modulated phase offset, in-phase/quadrature-phase offset from the origin, and magnitude. Our method provides stable and robust identification by developing individual identifiers (classifiers) that may each be weak (i.e., incurring a high prediction error) but their committee can provide a strong classification technique. We use two methods for combining the classifiers: (1) weighted voting, and (2) maximum likelihood. Our hardware implementation and experimental evaluations over multiple radios demonstrate that our weighted voting approach can identify the radios with an average of 88% detection probability and an average of 12.8% probability of false alarm after testing only 5 frames. The probability of detection and probability of false alarms both rapidly improve by increasing the number of test frames.","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Workshop on Hardware-Oriented Security and Trust","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Workshop on Hardware-Oriented Security and Trust","pdfPath":"/iel5/5209455/5224958/05224969.pdf","startPage":"43","endPage":"49","doi":"10.1109/HST.2009.5224969","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/HST.2009.5224969","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5224958","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robust stable radiometric fingerprinting for wireless devices","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5224969/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-27 July 2009","displayDocTitle":"Robust stable radiometric fingerprinting for wireless devices","htmlLink":"/document/5224969/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2009","dateOfInsertion":"28 August 2009","accessionNumber":"10844401","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"27-27 July 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust stable radiometric fingerprinting for wireless devices","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"rp0007-0035.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.11443S","chronDate":"27-27 July 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5209455","isNumber":"5224958","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5209455","citationCount":"36","xplore-issue":"5224958","articleId":"5224969","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5224971,"authors":[{"name":"Yier Jin","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Yale University, USA"],"firstName":"Yier","lastName":"Jin","id":"37402122400"},{"name":"Nathan Kupp","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Yale University, USA"],"firstName":"Nathan","lastName":"Kupp","id":"37601502100"},{"name":"Yiorgos Makris","affiliation":["Departments of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Yale University, USA"],"firstName":"Yiorgos","lastName":"Makris","id":"37274481400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4805-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4804-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5224971","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":124,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":2519},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5224971","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Circuit testing","Cryptography","Hardware design languages","Foundries","Embedded system","Application specific integrated circuits","Field programmable gate arrays","Manufacturing","Computer science","Computer security"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["security of data"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hardware Trojan design","embedded system challenge competition","register transfer level","Alpha encryption module","hardware Trojan attack"]}],"doi":"10.1109/HST.2009.5224971","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Workshop on Hardware-Oriented Security and Trust","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Workshop on Hardware-Oriented Security and Trust","pdfPath":"/iel5/5209455/5224958/05224971.pdf","startPage":"50","endPage":"57","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/HST.2009.5224971","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5224958","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Experiences in Hardware Trojan design and implementation","abstract":"We report our experiences in designing and implementing several hardware Trojans within the framework of the Embedded System Challenge competition that was held as part of the Cyber Security Awareness Week (CSAW) at the Polytechnic Institute of New York University in October 2008. Due to the globalization of the Integrated Circuit (IC) manufacturing industry, hardware Trojans constitute an increasingly probable threat to both commercial and military applications. With traditional testing methods falling short in the quest of finding hardware Trojans, several specialized detection methods have surfaced. To facilitate research in this area, a better understanding of what Hardware Trojans would look like and what impact they would incur to an IC is required. To this end, we present eight distinct attack techniques employing Register Transfer Level (RTL) hardware Trojans to compromise the security of an Alpha encryption module implemented on a Digilent BASYS Spartan-3 FPGA board. Our work, which earned second place in the aforementioned competition, demonstrates that current RTL designs are, indeed, quite vulnerable to hardware Trojan attacks.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5224971/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-27 July 2009","publicationDate":"July 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"27-27 July 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5224971/","dateOfInsertion":"28 August 2009","accessionNumber":"10844402","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Experiences in Hardware Trojan design and implementation","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Experiences in Hardware Trojan design and implementation","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"rp0008-0011.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041732S","chronDate":"27-27 July 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5209455","isNumber":"5224958","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5209455","citationCount":"124","xplore-issue":"5224958","articleId":"5224971","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5224990,"authors":[{"name":"D.

Indeed, an especially nefarious form of Trojan known as the time bomb has a payload activated in a delayed manner making it extremely hard to detect. As a result, chip trust detection at manufacturing test time may not be adequate especially for critical applications. This suggests that some form of dynamic trust detection of the chip both preliminary (possibly during a preproduction phase) and during in-field use at run time is required. We explore an approach to this problem that combines multicore hardware with dynamic distributed software scheduling to determine hardware trust during in-field use at run time. Our approach involves the scheduling and execution of functionally equivalent variants (obtained by different compilations, or different algorithm variations) simultaneously on different PEs and comparing the results. The process dynamically achieves trust determination by identifying the existence of Trojans with a high level of confidence.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"27-27 July 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5224990/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5224990/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10844403","conferenceDate":"27-27 July 2009","publicationDate":"July 2009","dateOfInsertion":"28 August 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Dynamic evaluation of hardware trust","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamic evaluation of hardware trust","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"rp0017-0033.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049304S","chronDate":"27-27 July 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5209455","isNumber":"5224958","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5209455","citationCount":"50","xplore-issue":"5224958","articleId":"5224990","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5225028,"authors":[{"name":"Sergei Skorobogatov","affiliation":["Computer of Cambridge, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK"],"firstName":"Sergei","lastName":"Skorobogatov","id":"37399441700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4805-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4804-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5225028","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":25,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":545},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Heating","Flash memory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cryptography","flash memories","semiconductor laser arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["flash memory devices","local heating attacks","EEPROM","inexpensive laser-diode module","memory cell","memory array","semiconductor chip","cryptographic keys","brute force attacks","semi-invasive attacks"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["hardware security","thermal attacks","semi-invasive attacks","optical attacks","data retention"]}],"abstract":"This paper shows how lasers can be used to implement modification attacks on EEPROM and flash memory devices.

Therefore, apart from architectural optimizations, circuit level considerations like supply voltage and body bias can improve the reliability of PUFs.","doi":"10.1109/HST.2009.5225054","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Workshop on Hardware-Oriented Security and Trust","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Workshop on Hardware-Oriented Security and Trust","pdfPath":"/iel5/5209455/5224958/05225054.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/HST.2009.5225054","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5224958","startPage":"30","endPage":"35","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Circuit-level techniques for reliable Physically Uncloneable Functions","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5225054","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Circuit-level techniques for reliable Physically Uncloneable Functions","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-27 July 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5225054/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"27-27 July 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2009","accessionNumber":"10844406","dateOfInsertion":"28 August 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5225054/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Circuit-level techniques for reliable Physically Uncloneable Functions","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"rp0005-0032.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.039406S","chronDate":"27-27 July 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5209455","isNumber":"5224958","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5209455","citationCount":"28","xplore-issue":"5224958","articleId":"5225054","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":5225055,"authors":[{"name":"Chi-En Yin","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering Department and Institute for Advanced Computer Studies, University of Maryland, College Park, MD, USA"],"lastName":"Chi-En Yin","id":"37893563200"},{"name":"Gang Qu","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering Department and Institute for Advanced Computer Studies, University of Maryland, College Park, MD, USA"],"lastName":"Gang Qu","id":"37269284700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4805-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4804-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5225055","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":43,"citationCountPatent":5,"totalDownloads":1495},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Ring oscillators","Hardware","Temperature","Manufacturing processes","Silicon","Fabrication","Security","Delay","Redundancy","Costs"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","oscillators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["temperature-aware cooperative ring oscillator","physical unclonable functions","silicon fabrication","FPGA"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Physical Unclonable Function (PUF)","ring oscillator","on-chip temperature awareness","cooperation","chip identification","secret-key storage","generation"]}],"abstract":"Physical unclonable functions leverage the manufacture variations during silicon fabrication process and have found many security related applications. The ring oscillator PUF relies on pairs of ring oscillators which have sufficiently large difference in delay to generate reliable bits. Current RO PUF approaches use redundancy to provide reliability under different operating temperature and thus have very high hardware cost.We propose a temperature-aware cooperative (TAC) RO PUF implementation to reduce such cost. The basic idea is to allow a pair of ring oscillators to generate an unreliable bit as long as we can find means to convert it to a reliable bit. We define bit generation rules that explicitly take temperature into consideration and pair up the ring oscillator pairs so they can cooperate. Experiments on FPGA show that our approach can significantly improve the efficiency of the RO PUF implementation. With the same hardware that the current state-of-art approach requires to generate one reliable bit, our TAC RO PUF approach can generate as high as 1.8 reliable bits, that is, an 80% improvement in hardware utilization.","doi":"10.1109/HST.2009.5225055","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Workshop on Hardware-Oriented Security and Trust","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Workshop on Hardware-Oriented Security and Trust","pdfPath":"/iel5/5209455/5224958/05225055.pdf","startPage":"36","endPage":"42","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/HST.2009.5225055","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5224958","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Temperature-aware cooperative ring oscillator PUF","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5225055","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-27 July 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5225055/","displayDocTitle":"Temperature-aware cooperative ring oscillator PUF","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2009","accessionNumber":"10844407","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5225055/","conferenceDate":"27-27 July 2009","dateOfInsertion":"28 August 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Temperature-aware cooperative ring oscillator PUF","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"rp0006-0036.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061737S","chronDate":"27-27 July 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5209455","isNumber":"5224958","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5209455","citationCount":"43","xplore-issue":"5224958","articleId":"5225055","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5225057,"authors":[{"name":"Shivam Bhasin","affiliation":["Department COMELEC, CNRS LTCI (UMR 5141)-TCP Project, Institut TELECOM, TELECOM ParisTech, Paris, France"],"firstName":"Shivam","lastName":"Bhasin","id":"37392052300"},{"name":"Nidhal Selmane","affiliation":["Department COMELEC, CNRS LTCI (UMR 5141)-TCP Project, Institut TELECOM, TELECOM ParisTech, Paris, France"],"firstName":"Nidhal","lastName":"Selmane","id":"37399516100"},{"name":"Sylvain Guilley","affiliation":["Department COMELEC, CNRS LTCI (UMR 5141)-TCP Project, Institut TELECOM, TELECOM ParisTech, Paris, France"],"firstName":"Sylvain","lastName":"Guilley","id":"37317992900"},{"name":"Jean-Luc Danger","affiliation":["Department COMELEC, CNRS LTCI (UMR 5141)-TCP Project, Institut TELECOM, TELECOM ParisTech, Paris, France"],"firstName":"Jean-Luc","lastName":"Danger","id":"37275155000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4805-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4804-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5225057","dbTime":"18 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":13,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":424},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Field programmable gate arrays","Cryptography","Circuit faults","Doped fiber amplifiers","Hardware","Telecommunications","Electromagnetic analysis","Silicon","Information security","Power system security"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cryptography","field programmable gate arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","advanced encryption standard","security evaluation","practical setup time violation attacks","fault attacks","sbox construction","side channel attacks","AES block cipher algorithm"]}],"abstract":"Security evaluation of various AES implementation against practical power attacks has been reported in literature. However, to the authors' knowledge, very few of the fault attacks reported on AES have been practically realized. Since sbox is a crucial element in AES, in this article, we evaluate the security of some unprotected AES implementations differing in sbox construction, targeted for FPGA. Here the faults have been generated practically by underpowering the targeted circuit. Then we correlate our results with the underlying architecture, along a methodology already suggested in other articles, albeit theoretically. We also carry out an extensive characterization of the faults, in terms of temporal localization. On the basis of our results, we reach the conclusion that the two cheaper implementations in terms of silicon area are also the more vulnerable against DFA when implemented without counter-measures.","doi":"10.1109/HST.2009.5225057","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Workshop on Hardware-Oriented Security and Trust","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Workshop on Hardware-Oriented Security and Trust","pdfPath":"/iel5/5209455/5224958/05225057.pdf","startPage":"15","endPage":"21","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/HST.2009.5225057","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5224958","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5225057","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Security evaluation of different AES implementations against practical setup time violation attacks in FPGAs","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-27 July 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5225057/","displayDocTitle":"Security evaluation of different AES implementations against practical setup time violation attacks in FPGAs","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5225057/","publicationDate":"July 2009","dateOfInsertion":"28 August 2009","conferenceDate":"27-27 July 2009","accessionNumber":"10844408","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Security evaluation of different AES implementations against practical setup time violation attacks in FPGAs","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"rp0003-0007.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.079868S","chronDate":"27-27 July 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5209455","isNumber":"5224958","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5209455","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"5224958","articleId":"5225057","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5225058,"authors":[{"name":"Klaus Kursawe","affiliation":["Philips Research Laboratories, Eindhoven, Netherlands"],"firstName":"Klaus","lastName":"Kursawe","id":"38152164100"},{"name":"Ahmad-Reza Sadeghi","affiliation":["Horst G\u00f6rtz Institute for IT Security, Ruhr Universit\u00e4t Bochum, Germany"],"firstName":"Ahmad-Reza","lastName":"Sadeghi","id":"37297197600"},{"name":"Dries Schellekens","affiliation":["ESAT-SCD/COSIC, Belgium and IBBT,IBBT, Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, Belgium"],"firstName":"Dries","lastName":"Schellekens","id":"37299209900"},{"name":"Boris Skoric","affiliation":["Technische Universiteit Eindhoven, Netherlands"],"firstName":"Boris","lastName":"Skoric","id":"38193758000"},{"name":"Pim Tuyls","affiliation":["ESAT-SCD/COSIC, Belgium and IBBT,IBBT, Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, Belgium"],"firstName":"Pim","lastName":"Tuyls","id":"37283201900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4805-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4804-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5225058","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":87,"citationCountPatent":11,"totalDownloads":2036},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5225058","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Nonvolatile memory","Cryptography","Adaptive optics","Optical scattering","Protection","Delay","Coatings","Random access memory","Sensor arrays","Secure storage"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cryptography","random sequences","random-access storage","system-on-package"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["physical unclonable functions","tamper resistant storage","random uncontrollable components","physical stimulus","cryptographic keys","nonvolatile storage"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Physical unclonable function","reconfiguration","non-volatile memory","tamper resistance"]}],"doi":"10.1109/HST.2009.5225058","endPage":"29","startPage":"22","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Workshop on Hardware-Oriented Security and Trust","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Workshop on Hardware-Oriented Security and Trust","pdfPath":"/iel5/5209455/5224958/05225058.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/HST.2009.5225058","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5224958","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reconfigurable Physical Unclonable Functions - Enabling technology for tamper-resistant storage","abstract":"A PUF or physical unclonable function is a function that is embodied in a physical structure that consists of many random uncontrollable components which originate from process variations during manufacturing. Due to this random structure a physical stimulus or challenge generates unpredictable responses. Because of their physical properties PUFs are unclonable and very promising primitives for the purpose of authentication and storage of cryptographic keys. Previous work on PUFs considers mainly static challenge-response PUFs. In many applications, however, a dynamic PUF would be desirable, e.g., in order to allow the key derived from the PUF to be updated. We define a new primitive, the reconfigurable PUF (rPUF) which is a PUF with a mechanism to transform it into a new PUF with a new unpredictable and uncontrollable challenge response behavior, even if the challenge-response behavior of the original PUF is already known. We present two practical instantiations of a reconfigurable PUF. One is a new variant of the optical PUF, and the other is based on phase change memory. We also illustrate how an rPUF can be used to protect nonvolatile storage against invasive physical attacks.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and

Future PON should be able to provide multiservices. In an on-off keying (OOK) OCDMA network, different bit-rates can be implemented through varying lengths of subscribers' address codes while bit-error-rates of the systems can be changed by adjusting codeweights in user's address codes. In this regard, we proposed a new family of two-dimensional variable-weight on the basis of the proposed one-dimensional variable-weight-OOCs. When this new code is employed for encoding different services, differentiated QoS for distinct services can be supported. In doing so, the demands of differentiated QoS for different services and distinct subscribers can be met and the usage of optical network resources can be optimized. It is shown by analysis that the cardinality of this type of codes is larger than that of constant-weight 2-D OOCs and is close to its theoretical upper bound.

In this paper, we propose a compiler driven hardware-software codesign strategy that works at application level, aiming at facilitating algorithm architecture co-explorations. The proposed approach employs an intermediate code representation, called loop hierarchy tree (LHT), to perform codesign exploration, and applies a branch-and-bound search to find a hardware-software partitioning that minimizes execution latency under the given area constraints. We also developed fast cost estimation models for LHT and can be extended to handle codesign for more complex hybrid architectures. Experimental results show that our approach is successful in finding good solutions for the applications on the target codesign platform.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A hardware-software codesign strategy for Loop intensive applications","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE 7th Symposium on Application Specific Processors","doi":"10.1109/SASP.2009.5226327","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE 7th Symposium on Application Specific Processors","pdfPath":"/iel5/5209559/5226326/05226327.pdf","startPage":"107","endPage":"113","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SASP.2009.5226327","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5226326","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5226327","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5226327/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-28 July 2009","displayDocTitle":"A hardware-software codesign strategy for Loop intensive applications","conferenceDate":"27-28 July 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5226327/","dateOfInsertion":"28 August 2009","publicationDate":"July 2009","accessionNumber":"10844601","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A hardware-software codesign strategy for Loop intensive applications","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"rp0018-173.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.079065S","chronDate":"27-28 July 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5209559","isNumber":"5226326","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5209559","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5226326","articleId":"5226327","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5226333,"authors":[{"name":"Alexandros Papakonstantinou","affiliation":["Electrical & Computer Engineering Department, University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, IL, USA"],"firstName":"Alexandros","lastName":"Papakonstantinou","id":"37396562200"},{"name":"Karthik Gururaj","affiliation":["Computer Science Dept, University of California, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Karthik","lastName":"Gururaj","id":"37870502100"},{"name":"John A.

The rise of multicore systems in all domains of computing has opened the door to heterogeneous multiprocessor, where processors of different compute characteristics can be combined to effectively boost the performance per watt of different application kernels. GPUs and FPGAs are becoming very popular in PC-based heterogeneous systems for speeding up compute intensive kernels of scientific, imaging and simulation applications. GPUs can execute hundreds of concurrent threads, while FPGAs provide customized concurrency for highly parallel kernels. However, exploiting the parallelism available in these applications is currently not a push-button task. Often the programmer has to expose the application's fine and coarse grained parallelism by using special APIs. CUDA is such a parallel computing API that is driven by the GPU industry and is gaining significant popularity. In this work, we adapt the CUDA programming model into a new FPGA design flow called FCUDA, which efficiently maps the coarse and fine grained parallelism exposed in CUDA onto the reconfigurable fabric. Our CUDA-to-FPGA flow employs autopilot, an advanced high level synthesis tool which enables high abstraction FPGA programming. FCUDA is based on a source-to-source compilation that transforms the SPMD CUDA thread blocks into parallel C code for autopilot. We describe the details of our CUDA-to-FPGA flow and demonstrate the highly competitive performance of the resulting customized FPGA multi-core accelerators. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first CUDA-to-FPGA flow to demonstrate the applicability and potential advantage of using the CUDA programming model for high-performance computing in FPGAs.","doi":"10.1109/SASP.2009.5226333","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE 7th Symposium on Application Specific Processors","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE 7th Symposium on Application Specific Processors","pdfPath":"/iel5/5209559/5226326/05226333.pdf","startPage":"35","endPage":"42","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5226326","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SASP.2009.5226333","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"FCUDA: Enabling efficient compilation of CUDA kernels onto FPGAs","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5226333","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-28 July 2009","displayDocTitle":"FCUDA: Enabling efficient compilation of CUDA kernels onto FPGAs","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5226333/","publicationDate":"July 2009","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"28 August 2009","accessionNumber":"10844607","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5226333/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"27-28 July 2009","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FCUDA: Enabling efficient compilation of CUDA kernels onto FPGAs","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"rp0006-133.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.115596S","chronDate":"27-28 July 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5209559","isNumber":"5226326","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5209559","citationCount":"81","xplore-issue":"5226326","articleId":"5226333","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":5226338,"authors":[{"name":"Jehangir Khan","affiliation":["University of Valenciennes, France"],"firstName":"Jehangir","lastName":"Khan","id":"37895150400"},{"name":"Smail Niar","affiliation":["University of Valenciennes, France"],"firstName":"Smail","lastName":"Niar","id":"37298902900"},{"name":"Mazen Saghir","affiliation":["Texas A and M University, Doha, Qatar"],"firstName":"Mazen","lastName":"Saghir","id":"37296726500"},{"name":"Yassin El-Hillali","affiliation":["University of Valenciennes, France"],"firstName":"Yassin","lastName":"El-Hillali","id":"38558532400"},{"name":"Atika Rivenq","affiliation":["University of Valenciennes, France"],"firstName":"Atika","lastName":"Rivenq","id":"38556750700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4939-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4938-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5226338","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":117},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Design optimization","Field programmable gate arrays","Application software","Software performance","Target tracking","Automotive engineering","Safety","Hardware","Software systems","Multiprocessing systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","logic design","multiprocessing systems","system-on-chip","traffic engineering computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["driver assistance system","FPGA","MPSoC","multiple target tracking"]}],"abstract":"This paper discusses the design and optimization of an FPGA based MPSoC dedicated to multiple target tracking (MTT) application.

In this paper, we propose a scalable organization for a hardware time-invariant beamformer that can be used in small handheld devices and complete 3D-audio systems. Our design can be configured according to the number of input channels. Furthermore, all critical internal modules, such as decimators, FIR filters and interpolators can be adjusted to support various input sampling rates. We developed a hardware prototype in VHDL targeting the Xilinx ML410 board incorporating Virtex4 FX60 FPGA. Following a constrained approach regarding FPGA resource utilization, our hardware prototype occupies 21% of the aforementioned FPGA when instantiating 16 beamforming modules, and consumes approximately 2 Watts of power. Furthermore, our design achieves a speedup of 28 compared to an OMP-annotated software implementation running on a Pentium D at 3.4 GHz. We also compared our design against prior related work. Results suggest that it can extract an audio source up to 11 times faster compared to a reconfigurable adaptive beamformer, and up to 19 times faster compared to DSP implementations.","doi":"10.1109/SASP.2009.5226341","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE 7th Symposium on Application Specific Processors","pdfPath":"/iel5/5209559/5226326/05226341.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5226326","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SASP.2009.5226341","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE 7th Symposium on Application Specific Processors","startPage":"80","endPage":"87","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A reconfigurable beamformer for audio applications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5226341","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-28 July 2009","displayDocTitle":"A reconfigurable beamformer for audio applications","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5226341/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5226341/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2009","accessionNumber":"10844615","dateOfInsertion":"28 August 2009","conferenceDate":"27-28 July 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A reconfigurable beamformer for audio applications","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"rp0014-124.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069787S","chronDate":"27-28 July 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5209559","isNumber":"5226326","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5209559","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"5226326","articleId":"5226341","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5226350,"authors":[{"name":"Ming Liu","affiliation":["Institute of Electronics, Chinese Academy and Sciences, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Ming","lastName":"Liu","id":"37401503300"},{"name":"Haigang Yang","affiliation":["Institute of Electronics, Chinese Academy and Sciences, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Haigang","lastName":"Yang","id":"37291236200"},{"name":"Sansiri Tanachutiwat","affiliation":["College of Nanoscales Science and Engineering, State University of New York, Albany, Albany, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Sansiri","lastName":"Tanachutiwat","id":"37541540000"},{"name":"Wei Wang","affiliation":["College of Nanoscales Science and Engineering, State University of New York, Albany, Albany, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Wang","id":"37280460900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4957-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4958-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2327-8218"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2327-8226"}],"articleNumber":"5226350","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":181},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"FPGA based on integration of carbon nanorelays and CMOS devices","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5226350","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Field programmable gate arrays","Nanoscale devices","Educational technology","Automation","Computer aided instruction","Automatic control","Military computing","Computer science","Computer science education","Instruments"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["carbon nanotubes","CMOS logic circuits","field programmable gate arrays","nanoelectronics","nanotube devices","network routing","reconfigurable architectures","relays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FPGA components","reconfigurable architecture","carbon nanorelay-CMOS device integration","2T1N structures","routing switches","signal transmission"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["FPGA","carbon nanotube","carbon nanorelay","nanoelectromechanical switch","CMOS-nano hybrid"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, a novel reconfigurable architecture, cFPGA (CMOS-Nanorelay FPGA) is developed by integrating carbon nanorelays and CMOS devices to function as FPGA components. cFPGA is a highly efficient architecture, providing 2\u00d7 density and standby power improvement along with 30% dynamic power reduction as compared to the CMOS FPGA circuits. This performance improvement is achieved by using 2T1N structures as routing switches: Two CMOS transistors (2T): one for programming purpose and the other for signal transmission; one nanorelay (1N): the switching element. These 2T1N structures do not have nanorelays in the signal path, thereby eliminating the large quantum resistance in the path. This is a significant improvement over the conventional CMOS-nanorelay hybrid FPGA circuits. The proposed cFPGA is implemented using vertical carbon nanotubes which are relatively easier to fabricate as compared with horizontal nanotubes.","doi":"10.1109/NANOARCH.2009.5226350","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NANOARCH.2009.5226350","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Nanoscale Architectures","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Nanoscale Architectures","pdfPath":"/iel5/5209244/5226345/05226350.pdf","startPage":"61","endPage":"64","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5226345","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5226350/","chronOrPublicationDate":"30-31 July 2009","displayDocTitle":"FPGA based on integration of carbon nanorelays and CMOS devices","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"30-31 July 2009","accessionNumber":"10844259","htmlLink":"/document/5226350/","dateOfInsertion":"28 August 2009","publicationDate":"July 2009","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FPGA based on integration of carbon nanorelays and CMOS devices","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"rp0013-014.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062803S","chronDate":"30-31 July 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5209244","isNumber":"5226345","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5209244","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5226345","articleId":"5226350","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5226353,"authors":[{"name":"Shu Li","affiliation":["Department of Electrical, Computer and Systems Engineering, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Troy, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Shu","lastName":"Li","id":"37405423800"},{"name":"Tong Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical, Computer and Systems Engineering, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Troy, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Tong","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37273954300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4957-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4958-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2327-8218"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2327-8226"}],"articleNumber":"5226353","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":91},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5226353","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Carbon nanotubes","Educational technology","Automation","Computer aided instruction","Automatic control","Military computing","Computer science","Computer science education","Instruments","Application software"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["carbon nanotubes","delay circuits","integrated memory circuits","scaling circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["carbon nanotube","digital memories","continuous technology scaling","interconnect delay","integrated circuit performance","contact resistance","hybrid word-line/bit-line design","HSPICE simulations","size 16 nm"]}],"abstract":"With the continuous technology scaling, interconnect delay plays an increasingly important role in determining integrated circuit performance. This has motivated tremendous research efforts on searching better interconnect technologies as alternatives to conventional Cu wires, among which carbon nanotube (CNT) has received the most attentions. However, in spite of its well demonstrated relatively small delay over long distance, CNT has several drawbacks that prevent it from being used in practice, including fabrication difficulty and contact resistance. This work concerns the practical use of carbon nanotube in digital memories, in particular this paper presents a simple yet effective hybrid word-line/bit-line design solution that aims to complement metal wire with CNT in order to well leverage the low resistance property of CNT and meanwhile embrace the drawbacks inherent in CNT. HSPICE simulations were carried out to demonstrate the effectiveness of this hybrid design strategy at technology nodes down to 16 nm.","doi":"10.1109/NANOARCH.2009.5226353","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NANOARCH.2009.5226353","startPage":"57","endPage":"60","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Nanoscale Architectures","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Nanoscale Architectures","pdfPath":"/iel5/5209244/5226345/05226353.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5226345","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Using carbon nanotube in digital memories","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5226353/","conferenceDate":"30-31 July 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"30-31 July 2009","displayDocTitle":"Using carbon nanotube in digital memories","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"28 August 2009","accessionNumber":"10844262","publicationDate":"July 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5226353/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Using carbon nanotube in digital memories","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"rp0012-013.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.07963S","chronDate":"30-31 July 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5209244","isNumber":"5226345","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5209244","xplore-issue":"5226345","articleId":"5226353","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5226356,"authors":[{"name":"Eero Lehtonen","affiliation":["Department of Information Technology, University of Turku, Turku, Finland"],"firstName":"Eero","lastName":"Lehtonen","id":"37304197400"},{"name":"Mika Laiho","affiliation":["Department of Information Technology, University of Turku, Turku, Finland"],"firstName":"Mika","lastName":"Laiho","id":"37270811800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4957-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4958-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2327-8218"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2327-8226"}],"articleNumber":"5226356","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":131,"citationCountPatent":4,"totalDownloads":1818},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5226356","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Logic","Memristors","Educational technology","Automation","Computer aided instruction","Automatic control","Military computing","Computer science","Computer science education","Instruments"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Boolean functions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["stateful implication logic","memristors","logic operation","Boolean logic","logic gate","stateful logic","Boolean function","computing sequence"]}],"abstract":"In this paper computation with memristors is studied in terms of how many memristors are needed to perform a given logic operation. It has been shown that memristors are naturally suited for performing implication logic (combination of implication and false operation) instead of Boolean logic. Also, it should be noted that a memristor can be used as both a logic gate and a latch (stateful logic). Being functionally complete, implication logic can be used to compute any Boolean function. However, by performing implication logic with stateful devices, storage of intermediate results requires additional memristors to keep data yet to be used from being written over. This paper describes an effective way to compute any Boolean function with a small number of memristors.

Unlike CMOS devices, however, majority of these devices are not suitable for implementing cascaded, irregular logic structure. On the other hand, dense and periodic structures of most emerging nanodevices as well as their bi-stable nature make them amenable to large high-density memory array design. Moreover, self-assembly of many nanostructures is efficient for a bottom-up system design flow. Hence, reconfigurable computing paradigms that use memory as underlying computing element, appear promising for these devices. In this paper, first we study nanoscale FPGA, which extends conventional spatial CMOS FPGA architecture using nanoscale memory and interconnect. Next, we focus on a time-multiplexed memory based computing paradigm that employs two-dimensional memory for improved performance, integration density and resource usage.","doi":"10.1109/NANOARCH.2009.5226362","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NANOARCH.2009.5226362","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Nanoscale Architectures","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Nanoscale Architectures","pdfPath":"/iel5/5209244/5226345/05226362.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5226345","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Computing with nanoscale memory: Model and architecture","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5226362/","chronOrPublicationDate":"30-31 July 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Computing with nanoscale memory: Model and architecture","conferenceDate":"30-31 July 2009","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"28 August 2009","publicationDate":"July 2009","accessionNumber":"10844271","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5226362/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Computing with nanoscale memory: Model and architecture","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"rp0001-001.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051856S","chronDate":"30-31 July 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5209244","isNumber":"5226345","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5209244","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"5226345","articleId":"5226362","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5226363,"authors":[{"name":"Yiran Chen","affiliation":["Seagate Technologies, Inc., Shakopee, MN, USA"],"firstName":"Yiran","lastName":"Chen","id":"37281023800"},{"name":"Xiaobin Wang","affiliation":["Seagate Technologies, Inc., Bloomington, MN, USA"],"firstName":"Xiaobin","lastName":"Wang","id":"37311498100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4957-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4958-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2327-8218"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2327-8226"}],"articleNumber":"5226363","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":45,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":833},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Magnetoelectronics","Memristors","Circuit simulation","Magnetic analysis","Solid state circuits","Magnetic films","Thin film circuits","Thin film devices","Magnetic devices","Hardware design languages"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["analogue circuits","hardware description languages","magnetic domain walls","magnetoelectronics","micromechanical devices","SPICE","thin film devices"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compact modeling","corner analysis","spintronic memristor","solid-state thin film memristive device","magnetic-domain-wall motion mechanism","Verilog-A language","SPICE-based simulation","corner model generation","complex circuitry","memory array","analog circuit design","process variation effects"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5226363","abstract":"The 4\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">th</sup>\n fundamental circuit elements - memristor received significant attentions after a real device was recently demonstrated for the first time. Besides the solid-state thin film memristive device, sprintonic memristor was also invented based on the magnetic technology. In this paper, we describe a compact model of the spintronic memristor based on the magnetic-domain-wall motion mechanism. Our proposed compact model can be easily implemented by Verilog-A language and compatible to SPICE-based simulation. Furthermore, we discuss the corner model generation of spintronic memristors to improve the simulation efficiency of large scale or complex circuitry, e.g., memory array or some analog circuit design.

Two techniques have been developed to achieve this goal using thinned die: die flip chip bonded onto flexible substrates [polyimide and liquid crystal polymer (LCP)] and die flip chip laminated onto LCP films. A key to achieving each of these techniques is the thinning of die to a thickness of 50 mum or thinner. Conventional grinding and polishing can be used to thin to 50 mum. At 50 mum, the active die becomes flexible and must be handled by temporarily bonding it to a holder die for assembly. Both reflow solder and thermocompression assembly methods are used. In the case of solder assembly, underfill is used to reinforce the solder joints. With thermocompression bonding of the die to an LCP substrate, the LCP adheres to the die surface, eliminating the need for underfill.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5261115","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electronics Packaging Manufacturing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electronics Packaging Manufacturing","pdfPath":"/iel5/6104/5261115/05226555.pdf","doi":"10.1109/TEPM.2009.2028880","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TEPM.2009.2028880","startPage":"291","endPage":"300","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Flexible Electronics: Thin Silicon Die on Flexible Substrates","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 August 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5226555/","displayDocTitle":"Flexible Electronics: Thin Silicon Die on Flexible Substrates","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5226555/","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"32","issue":"4","accessionNumber":"10917760","dateOfInsertion":"06 October 2009","publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Flexible Electronics: Thin Silicon Die on Flexible Substrates","sourcePdf":"tepm-johnson-2028880.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.085194S","chronDate":"Oct.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"6104","isNumber":"5261115","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6104","citationCount":"33","xplore-issue":"5261115","articleId":"5226555","onlineDate":"28 August 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5226559,"authors":[{"name":"Aleksandar Borisavljevic","affiliation":["Electrical Energy Conversion Group, Delft University of Technology, Delft, The Netherlands"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/5352216/5226559/5226559-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Aleksandar Borisavljevic (S'07) received the M.Sc. degree from the Faculty of Electrical Engineering, University of Belgrade, Belgrade, Serbia, in 2004.

In this paper, we analyze and model an advanced energy storage device, namely, zinc bromide, for vehicular applications. This system has high energy and power density, high efficiency, and long life. A series of tests has been conducted on the storage to create an electrical model of the system. The modeling results show that the open-circuit voltage of the battery is a direct function of the battery's state of charge (SOC). In addition, the battery internal resistance is also a function of SOC at constant temperature. A Kalman filtering technique is also designed to adjust the estimated SOC according to battery current.","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2009.2030765","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/41/5379132/05226561.pdf","startPage":"624","endPage":"632","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2009.2030765","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5379132","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Modeling of Zinc Bromide Energy Storage for Vehicular Applications","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5226561/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 August 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2010","displayDocTitle":"Modeling of Zinc Bromide Energy Storage for Vehicular Applications","volume":"57","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2010","accessionNumber":"11054644","htmlLink":"/document/5226561/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"12 January 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modeling of Zinc Bromide Energy Storage for Vehicular Applications","sourcePdf":"tie-nasiri-2030765.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.049312S","chronDate":"Feb.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"5379132","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"43","xplore-issue":"5379132","articleId":"5226561","onlineDate":"28 August 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5226569,"authors":[{"name":"Stefano Tebaldini","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Elettronica ed Informazione, Politecnico di Milano, Milan, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/36/5332061/5226569/5226569-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Stefano Tebaldini received the M.S. degree in telecommunication engineering and the Ph.D. degree from the Politecnico di Milano, Milan, Italy, in 2005 and 2009, respectively.","He is currently with the Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) Research Group, Politecnico di Milano.

Such a methodology is based on three hypotheses: 1) statistical uncorrelation of the different scattering mechanisms (SMs), such as ground, volume, and ground-trunk scattering; 2) independence of volumetric and temporal coherence losses of each SM on the choice of the polarimetric channel; and 3) invariance (up to a scale factor) of the average polarimetric signature of each SM with respect to the choice of the track. Under these hypotheses, the data covariance matrix can be expressed as a Sum of Kronecker Products, after which it follows that K SMs are uniquely identified by K (K - 1) real numbers. This result provides the basis to perform SM separation by employing not only model-based approaches, generally retained in literature but also model-free and hybrid approaches, while yielding the best Least Square solution given the hypothesis of K SMs. It will be shown that this approach to SM separation is consistent with the inversion procedures usually exploited in single-baseline polarimetric SAR interferometry. Experimental validation of this methodology is provided on the basis of the P-band data set relative to the forest site of Remningstorp, Sweden, acquired by German Aerospace Center's E-SAR airborne system in the framework of the European Space Agency campaign BioSAR.","doi":"10.1109/TGRS.2009.2023785","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel5/36/5332061/05226569.pdf","startPage":"4132","endPage":"4142","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2009.2023785","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5332061","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Algebraic Synthesis of Forest Scenarios From Multibaseline PolInSAR Data","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5226569","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 August 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5226569/","displayDocTitle":"Algebraic Synthesis of Forest Scenarios From Multibaseline PolInSAR Data","volume":"47","issue":"12","publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","accessionNumber":"10979193","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5226569/","dateOfInsertion":"17 November 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Algebraic Synthesis of Forest Scenarios From Multibaseline PolInSAR Data","sourcePdf":"tgrs-tebaldini-2023785.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.070019S","chronDate":"Dec.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"36","isNumber":"5332061","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"128","xplore-issue":"5332061","articleId":"5226569","onlineDate":"28 August 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5226570,"authors":[{"name":"Beg\u00dcm Demir","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Telecommunications Engineering, University of Kocaeli, Kocaeli, Turkey"],"firstName":"Beg\u00dcm","lastName":"Demir","id":"37398351600"},{"name":"Sarp Erturk","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Telecommunications Engineering, University of Kocaeli, Kocaeli, Turkey"],"firstName":"Sarp","lastName":"Erturk","id":"37267855900"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1545-598X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-0571"}],"articleNumber":"5226570","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":31,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":485},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Society","url":"http://www.grss-ieee.org/"}],"abstract":"This letter presents an accurate support vector machine (SVM)-based hyperspectral image classification algorithm, which uses border training patterns that are close to the separating hyperplane.

In the second step, the reduced-size training data composed of cluster centers are used in SVM training, and cluster centers obtained as support vectors at this step are regarded to be located close to the hyperplane border. Original training samples are contained in clusters for which the cluster centers are obtained to be close to the hyperplane border and the corresponding cluster centers are then together assigned as border training patterns. These border training patterns are then used in the training of the SVM classifier. Experimental results show that it is possible to significantly increase the classification accuracy of SVM using border training patterns obtained with the proposed approach.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters","pdfPath":"/iel5/8859/5278412/05226570.pdf","startPage":"840","endPage":"844","publicationTitle":"IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters","doi":"10.1109/LGRS.2009.2026656","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LGRS.2009.2026656","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5278412","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5226570","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Clustering-Based Extraction of Border Training Patterns for Accurate SVM Classification of Hyperspectral Images","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Support vector machines","Support vector machine classification","Hyperspectral imaging","Hyperspectral sensors","Training data","Kernel","Image classification","Image sensors","Neural networks","Classification algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["geophysical techniques","image classification","pattern clustering","support vector machines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["clustering based extraction","border training patterns","SVM classification","hyperspectral images","support vector machine","cluster centers"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Border training patterns","classification","clustering","hyperspectral images","support vector machine (SVM)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5226570/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 August 2009","displayDocTitle":"Clustering-Based Extraction of Border Training Patterns for Accurate SVM Classification of Hyperspectral Images","volume":"6","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/5226570/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","accessionNumber":"10940324","dateOfInsertion":"13 October 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Clustering-Based Extraction of Border Training Patterns for Accurate SVM Classification of Hyperspectral Images","sourcePdf":"lgrs-demir-2026656.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.051578S","chronDate":"Oct.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"8859","isNumber":"5278412","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8859","citationCount":"31","xplore-issue":"5278412","articleId":"5226570","onlineDate":"28 August 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5226574,"authors":[{"name":"Mariusz Malinowski","affiliation":["Institute of Control and Industrial Electronics, Warsaw University of Technology, Warsaw, Poland"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/5483249/5226574/5226574-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Mariusz Malinowski (M'99\u2013SM'08) received the M.Sc. and Ph.D. degrees (with honors) in electrical engineering from the Institute of Control and Industrial Electronics, Warsaw University of Technology (WUT), Warsaw, Poland, in 1997 and 2001, respectively.","He was a Visiting Scholar with Aalborg University, Aalborg, Denmark, the University of Nevada, Reno, and the Technical University of Berlin, Berlin, Germany.

To obtain a higher level of contouring motion control performance for multiaxis mechanical systems subject to significant nonlinear cogging forces, both the coordinated control of multiaxis motions and the effective compensation of cogging forces are necessary. In addition, the effect of unavoidable velocity measurement noises needs to be sufficiently attenuated. This paper presents a discontinuous-projection-based desired compensation adaptive robust contouring controller to address these control issues all at once. Specifically, the presented approach explicitly takes into account the specific characteristics of cogging forces in the controller designs and employs the task coordinate formulation for coordinated motion controls. Theoretically, the resulting controller achieves a guaranteed transient performance and a steady-state contouring accuracy even in the presence of both parametric uncertainties and uncertain nonlinearities. In addition, the controller also achieves asymptotic output tracking when there are parametric uncertainties only. Comparative experimental results obtained on a high-speed Anorad industrial biaxial precision gantry are presented to verify the excellent contouring performance of the proposed control scheme and the effectiveness of the cogging force compensations.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2009.2030769","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5446457","startPage":"1746","endPage":"1754","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/41/5446457/05226579.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Coordinated Adaptive Robust Contouring Control of an Industrial Biaxial Precision Gantry With Cogging Force Compensations","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5226579/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 August 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5226579/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Coordinated Adaptive Robust Contouring Control of an Industrial Biaxial Precision Gantry With Cogging Force Compensations","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2010","accessionNumber":"11229006","dateOfInsertion":"12 April 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"57","issue":"5","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Coordinated Adaptive Robust Contouring Control of an Industrial Biaxial Precision Gantry With Cogging Force Compensations","sourcePdf":"tie-yao-2030769.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.155742S","chronDate":"May  2010","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"5446457","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"73","xplore-issue":"5446457","articleId":"5226579","onlineDate":"28 August 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-02"},{"_id":5226580,"authors":[{"name":"Kerim Fouli","affiliation":["Optical Zeitgeist Laboratory, I.

Unique optical codes are assigned to selected optical network units (ONUs) equipped with the corresponding encoders. An out-of-band pulse train is broadcast from the optical line terminal (OLT) and is modulated by ONU-based switches. The encoded reflections of pulses are thus used to update the status of the OC-enabled queues at the OLT in real time. We explore the enhanced PON architecture and define its major design parameters. Through extensive simulations, we investigate the design principles and limits of our system parameters. Through a performance comparison of native interleaved polling with adaptive cycle time with its OC-enhanced counterpart, we show that our OC enhancement breaks the fundamental delay lower bound associated to the polling cycle. We propose and investigate new dynamic bandwidth allocation (DBA) algorithms that exploit real-time queue updates enabled through OC-enhanced polling. We also explore the pay-as-you-grow implementation of OC-enhanced polling to realize quality-of-service (QoS) differentiation, elaborate on possible migration paths from conventional PONs, and investigate absolute QoS performance guarantee improvements achieved through OC-enabled real-time DBA algorithms.","doi":"10.1109/JLT.2009.2031161","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/50/5282655/05226580.pdf","startPage":"5376","endPage":"5384","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JLT.2009.2031161","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5282655","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optical Coding for Enhanced Real-Time Dynamic Bandwidth Allocation in Passive Optical Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5226580","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 August 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.1,  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5226580/","displayDocTitle":"Optical Coding for Enhanced Real-Time Dynamic Bandwidth Allocation in Passive Optical Networks","volume":"27","issue":"23","publicationDate":"Dec.1, 2009","accessionNumber":"10916408","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5226580/","dateOfInsertion":"09 October 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optical Coding for Enhanced Real-Time Dynamic Bandwidth Allocation in Passive Optical Networks","sourcePdf":"jlt-fouli-2031161.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.078605S","chronDate":"Dec.1,  2009","xplore-pub-id":"50","isNumber":"5282655","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"5282655","articleId":"5226580","onlineDate":"28 August 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5226582,"authors":[{"name":"Gilbert Foo","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Telecommunications, University of New South Wales, Sydney, NSW, Australia"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/5352216/5226582/5226582-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Gilbert Foo (S'06) received the Diploma (with distinction) in electrical and electronics engineering from INTI College, Subang Jaya, Malaysia, in 2004, and the B.E.E. degree (first-class honors) from the University of New South Wales, Sydney, Australia, in 2007, where he is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree.","His research interests are electrical machines and drives.","Mr. Foo is a member of the IEEE Industrial Electronics, IEEE Power Electronics, and IEEE Industry Applications Societies."]},"firstName":"Gilbert","lastName":"Foo","id":"37395868900"},{"name":"M.

The drive uses a new stator flux observer based on the extended rotor flux concept. Due to the simultaneous implementation of stationary and rotating reference frames, the proposed observer does not require any speed adaptation and is inherently sensorless. Unlike speed adaptive observers, the proposed observer is immune to speed estimation errors; thus, its performance at very low speed is improved significantly. A novel stator resistance estimator is incorporated into the sensorless drive to compensate the effects of stator resistance variation. The global asymptotic stabilities of both the flux observer and stator resistance estimator are guaranteed by the Lyapunov stability analysis. Simulation and experimental results at very low speeds, including 0 and 5 r/min, confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2009.2030815","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5352216","startPage":"395","endPage":"403","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/41/5352216/05226582.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sensorless Direct Torque and Flux-Controlled IPM Synchronous Motor Drive at Very Low Speed Without Signal Injection","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5226582/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 August 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5226582/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Sensorless Direct Torque and Flux-Controlled IPM Synchronous Motor Drive at Very Low Speed Without Signal Injection","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2010","accessionNumber":"11019829","dateOfInsertion":"11 December 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"57","issue":"1","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sensorless Direct Torque and Flux-Controlled IPM Synchronous Motor Drive at Very Low Speed Without Signal Injection","sourcePdf":"tie-foo-2030815.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.114554S","chronDate":"Jan.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"5352216","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"132","xplore-issue":"5352216","articleId":"5226582","onlineDate":"28 August 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5226583,"authors":[{"name":"Robert Stala","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Drive and Industrial Equipment, AGH University of Science and Technology, Krakow, Poland"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/5427230/5226583/5226583-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Robert Stala was born in Krakow, Poland, in 1972.

The three operating modes are no-load, safe, and fault modes. The detection scheme probes the transmitter circuitry periodically to determine the operating mode. For power saving, the transmitter is powered down when there is no valid receiver placed on the transmitting coil. If any conductive or magnetic object that can affect the total effective inductance of the transmitting coil is located nearby, the system will enter the fault mode and shut down the transmitter so that it will not be damaged. The \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">safe</i>\n mode is the nominal operation mode when the power transmission efficiency is high with minimum power loss and zero-voltage switching operation of the class-E transmitter is achieved. The determination of the operating mode is achieved by analyzing the transmitting coil voltage and supply current space, requiring no communication link between the transmitter and receiver. The linear relationship between the power delivery and the supply current can be used to calculate the power delivered to the load(s).","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5226585/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 August 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"57","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2010","dateOfInsertion":"08 March 2010","accessionNumber":"11168833","htmlLink":"/document/5226585/","displayDocTitle":"Method of Load/Fault Detection for Loosely Coupled Planar Wireless Power Transfer System With Power Delivery Tracking","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Method of Load/Fault Detection for Loosely Coupled Planar Wireless Power Transfer System With Power Delivery Tracking","sourcePdf":"tie-low-2030821.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.070488S","chronDate":"April  2010","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"5427230","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"59","xplore-issue":"5427230","articleId":"5226585","onlineDate":"28 August 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5226586,"authors":[{"name":"Noriaki Kaneda","affiliation":["Bell Laboratories, Alcatel-Lucent, Murray Hill, NJ, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/50/5401119/5226586/5226586-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Noriaki Kaneda (S'98\u2013M'00) received the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from the University of California, Los Angeles, in 2000.

A dc link voltage arrangement for the new hybrid and asymmetric solution is presented to have a maximum number of output voltage levels by preserving the adjacent switching vectors between voltage levels. Hence, a 15-level hybrid converter can be attained with a minimum number of power components. A comparative study has been carried out to present high performance of the proposed configuration to approach a very low total harmonic distortion of voltage and current, which leads to the possible elimination of the output filter. Regarding the proposed configuration, a new cascade inverter is verified by cascading an asymmetrical diode-clamped inverter, in which 19 levels can be synthesized in output voltage with the same number of components. To balance the dc link capacitor voltages for the maximum output voltage resolution as well as synthesize asymmetrical dc link combination, a new multi-output boost converter is utilized at the dc link voltage of a seven-level H-bridge diode-clamped inverter. Simulation and hardware results based on different modulations are presented to confirm the validity of the proposed approach to achieve a high-quality output voltage.","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2009.2031115","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/63/5677632/05226591.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2009.2031115","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5677632","startPage":"51","endPage":"65","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Hybrid Cascade Converter Topology With Series-Connected Symmetrical and Asymmetrical Diode-Clamped H-Bridge Cells","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5226591","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A Hybrid Cascade Converter Topology With Series-Connected Symmetrical and Asymmetrical Diode-Clamped H-Bridge Cells","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5226591/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 August 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"26","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2011","accessionNumber":"11728040","dateOfInsertion":"30 December 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5226591/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Hybrid Cascade Converter Topology With Series-Connected Symmetrical and Asymmetrical Diode-Clamped H-Bridge Cells","sourcePdf":"tpel-nami-2031115-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.102708S","chronDate":"Jan.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"5677632","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"196","xplore-issue":"5677632","articleId":"5226591","onlineDate":"28 August 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5226595,"authors":[{"name":"Bashir Mahdi Ebrahimi","affiliation":["Center of Excellence on Applied Electromagnetics Systems, School of Electrical and engineering, University of Tehran, Tehran, Iran"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/5282654/5226595/5226595-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Bashir Mahdi Ebrahimi was born in Iran in 1979.

This paper investigates how the static eccentricity (SE), dynamic eccentricity (DE), and ME in three-phase PMSMs can be detected. A novel index for noninvasive diagnosis of these eccentricities is introduced for a faulty PMSM. The nominated index is the amplitude of sideband components with a particular frequency pattern which is extracted from the spectrum of stator current. Using this index makes it possible to determine the occurrence, as well as the type and percentage, of eccentricity precisely. Meanwhile, the current spectrum of the faulty PMSM during a large span is inspected, and the ability of the proposed index is exhibited to detect eccentricity in faulty PMSMs with different loads. A novel theoretical scrutiny based on a magnetic field analysis is presented to prove the introduced index and generalize the illustrated fault recognition method. To show the merit of this index in the eccentricity detection and estimation of its severity, first, the correlation between the index and the SE and DE degrees is determined. Then, the type of the eccentricity is determined by a \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">k</i>\n-nearest neighbor classifier. At the next step, a three-layer artificial neural network is employed to estimate the eccentricity degree and its type. After all, a white Gaussian noise is added to the simulated current, and the robustness of the proposed index is analyzed with respect to the noise variance. In this paper, the PMSM under magnetic fault (demagnetization) and electrical faults (short and open circuits) is modeled, and the current spectrum of the faulty PMSM under demagnetization, short circuit, and open circuit faults is analyzed. It is demonstrated that the proposed index, due to eccentricity fault, is not generated in the current spectrum due to magnetic and electrical faults. Indeed, it is exposed that the introduced index is only created due to eccentricity fault and it is not sensitive to other faults. To model the PMSM eccentricities, a time-stepping finite-element method, which takes into account all geometrical and physical characteristics of the machine components, nonuniform permeance of the air gap, and nonuniform characteristics of the PM material, is employed. This model facilitates the access to the demanded signals in order to have accurate processing. A comparison of simulation and experimental results validate the proposed index.","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2009.2029577","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5282654","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2009.2029577","endPage":"4739","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/41/5282654/05226595.pdf","startPage":"4727","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Static-, Dynamic-, and Mixed-Eccentricity Fault Diagnoses in Permanent-Magnet Synchronous Motors","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 August 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5226595/","displayDocTitle":"Static-, Dynamic-, and Mixed-Eccentricity Fault Diagnoses in Permanent-Magnet Synchronous Motors","volume":"56","issue":"11","accessionNumber":"10916337","dateOfInsertion":"09 October 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5226595/","publicationDate":"Nov. 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Static-, Dynamic-, and Mixed-Eccentricity Fault Diagnoses in Permanent-Magnet Synchronous Motors","sourcePdf":"tie-ebrahimi-2029577.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.07494S","chronDate":"Nov.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"5282654","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"216","xplore-issue":"5282654","articleId":"5226595","onlineDate":"28 August 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5226596,"authors":[{"name":"Elena Villanueva","affiliation":["Electronics Engineering Department, Universidad T\u00e8cnica Federico Santa Mar\u00eda, Valparaiso, Chile"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/5282654/5226596/5226596-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Elena Villanueva received the Engineer and M.Sc. degrees in electronic engineering from the Universidad T\u00e9cnica Federico Santa Mar\u00eda (UTFSM), Valpara\u00edso, Chile, in 2008.","She is currently with the Electronics Engineering Department, UTFSM.

Moreover, a fuzzy logic approach allows us to conclude to the load level operating system and to inform the operator of the rotor fault severity. Several experimental results prove the performance of this method under various load levels and various fault severities. Notwithstanding, this approach requires a steady-state operating condition.

He later developed tunable coupled-cavity lasers using novel reactive-ion etching (RIE) technology that he created for the then new InP-based materials. At UCSB, he continued work on multiple-section tunable lasers, in 1988 inventing the widely-tunable multi-element mirror concept, which is now used in some JDSU products.

The SG-DBR lasers have more than 5 THz of frequency tuning range and can generate a coherent beat for a wide spectrum of frequencies. In addition, the SG-DBR lasers have large tuning sensitivities and do not exhibit any phase inversion over the frequency modulation bandwidths making them ideal for use as current controlled oscillators in feedback loops. These SG-DBR lasers have wide linewidths and require high feedback loop bandwidths in order to be used in OPLLs. This is made possible using photonic integration which provides low cost, easy to package compact loops with low feedback latencies.

While generalization in statistical learning theory originally refers to the model's ability to generalize well on unseen testing data drawn from the same distribution as that of the training data, we show that good generalization capability is also desirable for mismatched cases. One way to obtain such general models is to use margin-based model training method, e.g., soft-margin estimation (SME), to enable some tolerance to acoustic mismatches without a detailed knowledge about the distortion mechanisms through enhancing margins between competing models. Experimental results on the Aurora-2 and Aurora-3 connected digit string recognition tasks demonstrate that, by improving the model's generalization capability through SME training, speech recognition performance can be significantly improved in both matched and low to medium mismatched testing cases with no language model constraints. Recognition results show that SME indeed performs better with than without mean and variance normalization, and therefore provides a complimentary benefit to conventional feature normalization techniques such that they can be combined to further improve the system performance. Although this study is focused on noisy speech recognition, we believe the proposed margin-based learning framework can be extended to dealing with different types of distortions and robustness issues in other machine learning applications.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Study on the Generalization Capability of Acoustic Models for Robust Speech Recognition","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","doi":"10.1109/TASL.2009.2031236","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/10376/5508665/05226603.pdf","startPage":"1158","endPage":"1169","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TASL.2009.2031236","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5508665","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5226603","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5226603/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 August 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2010","displayDocTitle":"A Study on the Generalization Capability of Acoustic Models for Robust Speech Recognition","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"18","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/5226603/","dateOfInsertion":"16 August 2010","publicationDate":"Aug. 2010","accessionNumber":"11473536","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Study on the Generalization Capability of Acoustic Models for Robust Speech Recognition","sourcePdf":"17tasl08-xxiao-2031236-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.10588S","chronDate":"Aug.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"10376","isNumber":"5508665","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10376","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"5508665","articleId":"5226603","onlineDate":"28 August 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5226605,"authors":[{"name":"Gabriele Grandi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/5282654/5226605/5226605-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Gabriele Grandi (M'00) received the M.Sc.

The scheme is based on two insulated strings of PV panels, each one feeding the dc bus of a standard two-level three-phase voltage-source inverter (VSI). The inverters are connected to the grid by a three-phase transformer having open-end windings on the inverter side. The resulting conversion structure performs as a multilevel power active filter (equivalent to a three-level inverter), doubling the power capability of a single VSI with given voltage and current ratings. The multilevel voltage waveforms are generated by an improved space-vector-modulation algorithm, suitable for the implementation in industrial digital signal processors. An original control method has been introduced to regulate the dc-link voltages of each VSI, according to the voltage reference given by a single maximum power point tracking controller. The proposed regulation system has been verified by numerical simulations and experimental tests with reference to different operating conditions.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5226605/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 August 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10916339","volume":"56","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/5226605/","publicationDate":"Nov. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"09 October 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A New Multilevel Conversion Structure for Grid-Connected PV Applications","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A New Multilevel Conversion Structure for Grid-Connected PV Applications","sourcePdf":"tie-grandi-2029587.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.079249S","chronDate":"Nov.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"5282654","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"139","xplore-issue":"5282654","articleId":"5226605","onlineDate":"28 August 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5226607,"authors":[{"name":"Nicola Femia","affiliation":["Department of Information and Electrical Engineering, University of Salerno, Salerno, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/5282654/5226607/5226607-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Nicola Femia was born in Salerno, Italy, in 1963.

In addition to the line current, the stator line voltage influences the instantaneous power of the motor; therefore, harmonics of this power can be employed as a fault-diagnosis index when the motor is supplied by a closed-loop control method. It is theoretically shown that the frequencies of harmonics of the instantaneous power due to mixed eccentricity fault are the same for the mains-fed and open/closed-loop drive-connected motors, although the number of factors affecting the amplitudes of the harmonics is relatively large when closed-loop drive connected. A flexible test rig is described, which was established to carry out various measurements on the eccentric motor with different eccentricity degrees, under different supply and control methods, varying load, and variable speeds. The experimental results indicate that the amplitudes of the dominant instantaneous-power harmonics depend on the degrees of mixed-eccentricity static and dynamic components, although these amplitudes are influenced by the supply methods, load level, and speed of the motor.","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2009.2030816","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2009.2030816","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/41/5282654/05226609.pdf","startPage":"4718","endPage":"4726","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5282654","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5226609/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 August 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2009","displayDocTitle":"Instantaneous-Power Harmonics as Indexes for Mixed Eccentricity Fault in Mains-Fed and Open/Closed-Loop Drive-Connected Squirrel-Cage Induction Motors","volume":"56","issue":"11","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"10916342","htmlLink":"/document/5226609/","dateOfInsertion":"09 October 2009","publicationDate":"Nov. 2009","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Instantaneous-Power Harmonics as Indexes for Mixed Eccentricity Fault in Mains-Fed and Open/Closed-Loop Drive-Connected Squirrel-Cage Induction Motors","sourcePdf":"tie-faiz-2030816.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.082664S","chronDate":"Nov.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"5282654","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"34","xplore-issue":"5282654","articleId":"5226609","onlineDate":"28 August 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5226610,"authors":[{"name":"Abdelmalek Khezzar","affiliation":["Laboratoire d'Electrotechnique de Constantine, Mentouri University of Constantine, Constantine, Algeria"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/5282654/5226610/5226610-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Abdelmalek Khezzar (M'07) was born in Batna, Algeria, in 1969.

Input current to the floating body and output current from the body balance to generate an unstable stationary state that is accompanied by two stable stationary ones. The current anomaly of impact ionization is essential for the instability that brings about the bistability and is realized by positive feedback where impact ionization current input increases as the body voltage increases. Experiments with charge pumping current as output show that the autonomous refresh is possible on a single-cell basis. Necessary conditions for a high-density memory to be autonomously refreshed are derived and assessed for state-of-the-art FBCs. FBC is shown in simulation to become an SRAM cell when the autonomous refresh is applied, which uses gate direct tunneling current as output. This is an SRAM cell that is theoretically expected to have the simplest structure ever reported.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","pdfPath":"/iel5/16/5247140/05226612.pdf","startPage":"2302","endPage":"2311","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","doi":"10.1109/TED.2009.2028396","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TED.2009.2028396","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5247140","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5226612","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Autonomous Refresh of Floating-Body Cell due to Current Anomaly of Impact Ionization","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Charge pumps","Impact ionization","Arrays","Logic gates","Random access memory","Data mining","Digital video broadcasting"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["circuit feedback","impact ionisation","SRAM chips","tunnelling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["floating-body cell","impact ionization","spontaneous recovery mechanism","binary states","positive feedback","high-density memory","FBC","SRAM cell","gate direct tunneling current","autonomous refresh"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Autonomous refresh","capacitorless 1T-DRAM","charge pumping","data retention current","floating-body cell (FBC)","gate direct tunneling","impact ionization","SRAM"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5226612/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 August 2009","displayDocTitle":"Autonomous Refresh of Floating-Body Cell due to Current Anomaly of Impact Ionization","volume":"56","issue":"10","htmlLink":"/document/5226612/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","accessionNumber":"10878813","dateOfInsertion":"18 September 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Autonomous Refresh of Floating-Body Cell due to Current Anomaly of Impact Ionization","sourcePdf":"ted-ohsawa-2028396.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.096871S","chronDate":"Oct.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"16","isNumber":"5247140","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5247140","articleId":"5226612","onlineDate":"28 August 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5226614,"authors":[{"name":"John Erickson","affiliation":["Hewlett Packard Laboratories, Bristol, UK"],"bio":{"p":["John S.

We achieve interactive frame rates of up to 30 Hz for natural feature tracking from textured planar targets on current generation phones. We use an approach based on heavily modified state-of-the-art feature descriptors, namely SIFT and Ferns plus a template-matching-based tracker. While SIFT is known to be a strong, but computationally expensive feature descriptor, Ferns classification is fast, but requires large amounts of memory. This renders both original designs unsuitable for mobile phones. We give detailed descriptions on how we modified both approaches to make them suitable for mobile phones. The template-based tracker further increases the performance and robustness of the SIFT- and Ferns-based approaches. We present evaluations on robustness and performance and discuss their appropriateness for Augmented Reality applications.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5226627/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May-June  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 August 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"16","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May-June 2010","dateOfInsertion":"11 March 2010","accessionNumber":"11171783","htmlLink":"/document/5226627/","pubMedId":"20224132","displayDocTitle":"Real-Time Detection and Tracking for Augmented Reality on Mobile Phones","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Real-Time Detection and Tracking for Augmented Reality on Mobile Phones","sourcePdf":"ttg2010030355.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.05722S","chronDate":"May-June  2010","xplore-pub-id":"2945","isNumber":"5427319","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"2945","citationCount":"212","xplore-issue":"5427319","articleId":"5226627","onlineDate":"28 August 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5226635,"authors":[{"name":"Yasutaka Furukawa","affiliation":["Google, Inc., Seattle, WA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/34/5487331/5226635/5226635-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yasutaka Furukawa received the BS degree in computer science from the University of Tokyo in 2001, and the PhD degree in computer science from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in 2008.

Stereopsis is implemented as a match, expand, and filter procedure, starting from a sparse set of matched keypoints, and repeatedly expanding these before using visibility constraints to filter away false matches. The keys to the performance of the proposed algorithm are effective techniques for enforcing local photometric consistency and global visibility constraints. Simple but effective methods are also proposed to turn the resulting patch model into a mesh which can be further refined by an algorithm that enforces both photometric consistency and regularization constraints. The proposed approach automatically detects and discards outliers and obstacles and does not require any initialization in the form of a visual hull, a bounding box, or valid depth ranges. We have tested our algorithm on various data sets including objects with fine surface details, deep concavities, and thin structures, outdoor scenes observed from a restricted set of viewpoints, and \"crowded\" scenes where moving obstacles appear in front of a static structure of interest. A quantitative evaluation on the Middlebury benchmark [1] shows that the proposed method outperforms all others submitted so far for four out of the six data sets.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Accurate, Dense, and Robust Multiview Stereopsis","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","doi":"10.1109/TPAMI.2009.161","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel5/34/5487331/05226635.pdf","startPage":"1362","endPage":"1376","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPAMI.2009.161","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5487331","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5226635","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5226635/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 August 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2010","displayDocTitle":"Accurate, Dense, and Robust Multiview Stereopsis","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"32","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/5226635/","dateOfInsertion":"17 June 2010","publicationDate":"Aug. 2010","accessionNumber":"11373238","pubMedId":"20558871","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Accurate, Dense, and Robust Multiview Stereopsis","sourcePdf":"ttp2010081362.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.082266S","chronDate":"Aug.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"34","isNumber":"5487331","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"1508","xplore-issue":"5487331","articleId":"5226635","onlineDate":"28 August 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":5226688,"authors":[{"name":"Naga Sasidhar","affiliation":["Intel Corporation, Hillsboro, OR, USA","Oregon State University, Corvallis, OR, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4/5226685/5226688/5226688-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Naga Sasidhar received the B.Tech. degree in electrical engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology, Madras, in 2004 and the Ph.D. degree from Oregon State University, Corvallis, in 2009.","His doctoral research focused on low-power design techniques for high-speed pipelined ADCs.

In the proposed TX, the G/FSK data is applied outside the loop; hence, the data rate is not constrained by the PLL bandwidth. In addition, the PLL remains locked all the time, preventing the carrier frequency from drifting. In this architecture, the G/FSK modulation signal is generated from a proposed sigma-delta modulated phase rotator (\u00bf\u00bf-PR). By properly combining the multi-phase signals from the PLL output, the \u00bf\u00bf-PR effectively operates as a fractional frequency divider, which can synthesize modulation signals with fine-resolution frequencies. The proposed \u00bf\u00bf-PR adopts the input signal as the phase transition trigger, facilitating a glitch-free operation. The impact of the \u00bf\u00bf-PR on the TX output noise is also analyzed in this paper. The proposed TX with the \u00bf\u00bf-PR is digitally programmable and can generate various G/FSK signals for different applications. Fabricated in a 0.18 \u00bfm CMOS technology, the proposed TX draws 6.3 mA from a 1.4 V supply, and delivers an output power of -11 dBm. With a maximum data rate of 6 Mb/s, the TX achieves an energy efficiency of 1.5 nJ/bit.","doi":"10.1109/JSSC.2009.2022994","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel5/4/5226685/05226692.pdf","startPage":"2452","endPage":"2462","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSSC.2009.2022994","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5226685","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Wideband PLL-Based G/FSK Transmitter in 0.18 -m CMOS","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5226692","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 August 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5226692/","displayDocTitle":"A Wideband PLL-Based G/FSK Transmitter in 0.18 <formula formulatype=\"inline\"><tex Notation=\"TeX\">$\\mu$</tex></formula>m CMOS","volume":"44","issue":"9","publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"10846949","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5226692/","dateOfInsertion":"28 August 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Wideband PLL-Based G/FSK Transmitter in 0.18 <formula formulatype=\"inline\"><tex Notation=\"TeX\">$\\mu$</tex></formula>m CMOS","sourcePdf":"jssc-liu-2022994.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.054046S","chronDate":"Sept.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"4","isNumber":"5226685","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"33","xplore-issue":"5226685","articleId":"5226692","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5226694,"authors":[{"name":"Jeffrey S.

Lack of an accurate and fast simulation method is nonetheless evident for transmission lines in scaled CMOS where metal dummies inserted for IC planarization make their physical structure extremely complicate. Although lines are not uniform due to displacement of small dummies, they are still periodic. In this paper, we describe an analytical procedure, leveraging lines periodicity and based on Floquet's theorem, in order to derive electromagnetic parameters from simulations. Conventional, slow-wave and shielded CPWs have been realized in a 65 nm CMOS technology. Thanks to the developed method, an optimum line design has been made possible. The lossy CMOS substrate, responsible for a significant performance degradation, can be effectively shielded and achieved performances are comparable with other technologies considered better suited to implement low-loss, high frequency passive components. Shielded CPW lines show attenuation as low as 0.65 dB/mm at 60 GHz, a record in scaled CMOS.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design of Low-Loss Transmission Lines in Scaled CMOS by Accurate Electromagnetic Simulations","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","doi":"10.1109/JSSC.2009.2023277","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel5/4/5226685/05226695.pdf","startPage":"2605","endPage":"2615","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSSC.2009.2023277","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5226685","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5226695","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5226695/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 August 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2009","displayDocTitle":"Design of Low-Loss Transmission Lines in Scaled CMOS by Accurate Electromagnetic Simulations","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"44","issue":"9","htmlLink":"/document/5226695/","dateOfInsertion":"28 August 2009","publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"10846943","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design of Low-Loss Transmission Lines in Scaled CMOS by Accurate Electromagnetic Simulations","sourcePdf":"44jssc09-fvecchi-2023277.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.163403S","chronDate":"Sept.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"4","isNumber":"5226685","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"47","xplore-issue":"5226685","articleId":"5226695","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5226696,"authors":[{"name":"Imre Knausz","affiliation":["Synaptics, Inc., Pittsford, NY, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4/5226685/5226696/5226696-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Imre Knausz (M'00) was born in Esztergom, Hungary, in 1977.

Moreover, the input referred noise and offset analyses are included to demonstrate that the proposed modifications have no adverse effects on these design metrics. Transistor-level simulations and experimental results in TSMC 0.18 mum CMOS process confirm the theoretical results. When compared to the conventional folded cascode, and for the same area and power budgets, the proposed amplifier has almost twice the bandwidth (134.2 MHz versus 70.7 MHz) and better than twice the slew rate (94.1 V/mus versus 42.1 V/mus) while driving the same 5.6 pF load. Also a gain enhancement of 7.6 dB is observed.","doi":"10.1109/JSSC.2009.2024819","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSSC.2009.2024819","startPage":"2535","endPage":"2542","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel5/4/5226685/05226701.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5226685","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The Recycling Folded Cascode: A General Enhancement of the Folded Cascode Amplifier","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5226701/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 August 2009","displayDocTitle":"The Recycling Folded Cascode: A General Enhancement of the Folded Cascode Amplifier","volume":"44","issue":"9","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"28 August 2009","accessionNumber":"10846952","publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5226701/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Recycling Folded Cascode: A General Enhancement of the Folded Cascode Amplifier","sourcePdf":"44jssc09-jsilva-martinez-2024819.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.06656S","chronDate":"Sept.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"4","isNumber":"5226685","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"233","xplore-issue":"5226685","articleId":"5226701","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5226702,"authors":[{"name":"Shah M.

The MECC combines four data words to form a 128 bit composite ECC word, two of which are interleaved in a row to mitigate cosmic neutron-induced multi-bit errors. The use of a composite word reduces the number of check-bits by 68%, however, requires a unique write operation that updates the check-bits by writing one data word while reading the other three data words. The ground potential of the composite word is raised to a nonzero value during retention in order to limit the leakage power consumption. A critical charge-based soft error rate (SER) model is proposed to estimate the resulting increase in the SER. Both the MECC scheme and the SER model are verified by implementing a 64-kb SRAM macro in 90 nm CMOS technology. The SRAM consumes 5.34 pJ energy with a data latency of 3.3 ns, thus showing up to 82% per-bit energy saving and 8x speed improvement over previously reported multiword ECC schemes. Accelerated neutron radiation test of the SRAM confirms 85% soft error correction by the MECC and 90% accuracy of the SER model.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5226702/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 August 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2009","publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5226702/","dateOfInsertion":"28 August 2009","accessionNumber":"10846953","volume":"44","issue":"9","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Design and Analysis of A 5.3-pJ 64-kb Gated Ground SRAM With Multiword ECC","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design and Analysis of A 5.3-pJ 64-kb Gated Ground SRAM With Multiword ECC","sourcePdf":"44jssc08-sjahinuzzaman-2021088.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.066502S","chronDate":"Sept.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"4","isNumber":"5226685","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"5226685","articleId":"5226702","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-09"},{"_id":5226705,"authors":[{"name":"Robert A.

The ADC implemented in a 0.13 mum thick gate-oxide CMOS process achieves 69 dB SFDR, 58 dB SNR, and 56 dB SNDR, while consuming 3.5 mA from a 3 V supply.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A 10 MS/s 11-bit 0.19 mm- Algorithmic ADC With Improved Clocking Scheme","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","doi":"10.1109/JSSC.2009.2023158","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel5/4/5226685/05226753.pdf","startPage":"2348","endPage":"2355","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSSC.2009.2023158","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5226685","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5226753","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5226753/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 August 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2009","displayDocTitle":"A 10 MS/s 11-bit 0.19 mm<formula formulatype=\"inline\"> <tex Notation=\"TeX\">$^{2}$</tex></formula> Algorithmic ADC With Improved Clocking Scheme","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"44","issue":"9","htmlLink":"/document/5226753/","dateOfInsertion":"28 August 2009","publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"10846946","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A 10 MS/s 11-bit 0.19 mm<formula formulatype=\"inline\"> <tex Notation=\"TeX\">$^{2}$</tex></formula> Algorithmic ADC With Improved Clocking Scheme","sourcePdf":"44jssc09-mkim-2023158.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.06487S","chronDate":"Sept.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"4","isNumber":"5226685","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"5226685","articleId":"5226753","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5226754,"authors":[{"name":"Jerry Lopez","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Texas Tech University, Lubbock, TX, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4/5226685/5226754/5226754-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jerry Lopez (S'09) received the B.S. and M.E. degrees at the University of California at San Diego (UCSD) in 2001 and 2005, respectively.

A design prototype of a polar transmitter using ET and a monolithic SiGe PA that passed the stringent low-band EDGE (Enhanced Data rates for GSM Evolution) transmit mask with 45% overall transmitter system efficiency will be given; the simulated data of the entire polar transmitter system is also compared against the measurement.

The dual frequency range oscillator is based on enabling/disabling the driving current in the secondary port of the transformer. This approach eliminates the effect of switches connected directly to the VCO tank whose capacitance and on-resistance affect both the tuning range and the phase noise of a typical multi-band oscillator. The relation between the coupling coefficient of the transformer load, selection of frequency bands, and the resulting quality factor at each band is investigated. The concept is validated through measurement results from a prototype fabricated in 0.25 \u00bfm CMOS technology. The VCO has a measured tuning range of 1.94 to 2.55 GHz for the low frequency range and 3.6 to 4.77 GHz for the high frequency range. It draws a current of 1 mA from 1.8 V supply with a measured phase noise of -116 dBc/Hz at 1 MHz offset from a 2.55 GHz carrier.

This algorithm is inherently amenable to a compact, low power and high speed VLSI hardware embodiment. The paper compares the lossless image compression performance of the JPLpsilas SPCA algorithm with the state of the art JPEG2000, widely used due to its simplified hardware implementability. JPEG2000 is not an optimal data compression technique because of its fixed transform characteristics, regardless of its data structure. On the other hand, conventional Principal Component Analysis based transform (PCA-transform) is a data-dependent-structure transform. However, it is not easy to implement the PCA in compact VLSI hardware, due to its highly computational and architectural complexity. In contrast, the JPLpsilas ldquodominant-term selectionrdquo SPCA algorithm allows, for the first time, a compact, low-power hardware implementation of the powerful PCA algorithm. This paper presents a direct comparison of the JPLpsilas SPCA versus JPEG2000, incorporating the Huffman and arithmetic coding for completeness of the data compression operation. The simulation results show that JPLpsilas SPCA algorithm is superior as an optimal data-dependent-transform over the state of the art JPEG2000. When implemented in hardware, this technique is projected to be ideally suited to future NASA missions for autonomous on-board image data processing to improve the bandwidth of communication.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5226811/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-23 July 2009","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"19-23 July 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5226811/","dateOfInsertion":"28 August 2009","publicationDate":"July 2009","accessionNumber":"10844722","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Sequential Principal Component Analysis - A Hardware-Implementable Transform for Image Compression","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sequential Principal Component Analysis - A Hardware-Implementable Transform for Image Compression","confLoc":"Pasadena, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"3637a362.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.077458S","chronDate":"19-23 July 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5226791","isNumber":"5226792","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5226791","xplore-issue":"5226792","articleId":"5226811","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":5226845,"authors":[{"name":"Tao Wang","affiliation":["Institute of Artificial Intelligence and Robotics, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Tao","lastName":"Wang","id":"37897340600"},{"name":"Nanning Zheng","affiliation":["Institute of Artificial Intelligence and Robotics, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Nanning","lastName":"Zheng","id":"37271536700"},{"name":"Kuizhi Mei","affiliation":["Institute of Artificial Intelligence and Robotics, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Kuizhi","lastName":"Mei","id":"37721171300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3637-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5226845","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":420},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Robot vision systems","Orbital robotics","Humanoid robots","Computer vision","Space technology","Art","Hardware","Insects","Information processing","Machine vision"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["aerospace robotics","application specific integrated circuits","avionics","biomimetics","digital signal processing chips","field programmable gate arrays","integrated circuit design","intelligent robots","mobile robots","reduced instruction set computing","robot vision","television cameras"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["visual brain chip design","selective visual attention mechanism","real-time robot vision system application","biointelligent robot","humanoid robot","insect robot","space robot","biological visual information processing mechanism","biological vision system","eye movement control","complexity reduction","PTZ TV camera","ASIC technology","LEON RISC processor","FPGA development board","onboard computing resource","mobile robot"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["selective attention","biointelligence","robotic vision","image processing","ASIC","LEON processor"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5226845","doi":"10.1109/SMC-IT.2009.19","publicationTitle":"2009 Third IEEE International Conference on Space Mission Challenges for Information Technology","abstract":"Due to huge computational loads and the state of art of current hardware, nowadays how to implement real-time vision tasks on a signal chip is still a great interesting work. It is critical for eventually accomplishing biointelligence on robots, whatever humanoid robots, insect robots or even space robots. This paper presents a design of a so-called visual brain chip for robotic vision applications in order to explore biological visual information processing mechanisms. Biological vision systems explore their environments via allocating their visual resources to only the interesting parts of a scene. This is achieved by a selective visual attention mechanism that controls eye movements. Such mechanism is useful to reduce the complexity of calculation. The computational process was divided into three stages for achieving real-time visual computation. The whole system for the chip design used a PTZ TV camera, ASIC technology altogether with a LEON RISC processor and was verified on the FPGA development board. It is a good attempt for future robot vision system applications, especially for space robot, due to limited onboard computing resources, limited viewpoints and mobility.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SMC-IT.2009.19","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5226792","startPage":"93","endPage":"97","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Third IEEE International Conference on Space Mission Challenges for Information Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/5226791/5226792/05226845.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Visual Brain Chip Based on Selective Attention for Robot Vision Application","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5226845/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-23 July 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5226845/","displayDocTitle":"A Visual Brain Chip Based on Selective Attention for Robot Vision Application","conferenceDate":"19-23 July 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2009","accessionNumber":"10844755","dateOfInsertion":"28 August 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Visual Brain Chip Based on Selective Attention for Robot Vision Application","confLoc":"Pasadena, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"3637a093.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048809S","chronDate":"19-23 July 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5226791","isNumber":"5226792","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5226791","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5226792","articleId":"5226845","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5226852,"authors":[{"name":"D.

In walking the stride can be segmented into four different parts, and in golf and other sports, the swing is divided into section based on the primary direction of motion. When analyzing a movement, it is important to correctly locate the key events dividing portions. There exist methods for dividing certain actions using data from specific sensors. We introduce a generalized method for event annotation based on Hidden Markov Models. Genetic algorithms are used for feature selection and model parameterization. Further, collaborative techniques are explored. We validate this method on a walking dataset using inertial sensors placed on various locations on a human body. Our technique is computationally simple to allow it to run on resource constrained sensor nodes.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Sixth International Workshop on Wearable and Implantable Body Sensor Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/5226856/5226857/05226866.pdf","startPage":"339","endPage":"344","publicationTitle":"2009 Sixth International Workshop on Wearable and Implantable Body Sensor Networks","doi":"10.1109/BSN.2009.45","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/BSN.2009.45","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5226857","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5226866","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Distributed Hidden Markov Model for Fine-grained Annotation in Body Sensor Networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hidden Markov models","Body sensor networks","Legged locomotion","Foot","Genetic algorithms","Humans","Intelligent sensors","Gyroscopes","Data mining","Collaboration"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biomechanics","biomedical telemetry","body area networks","genetic algorithms","hidden Markov models","patient monitoring"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed Hidden Markov Model","fine grained annotation","body sensor networks","genetic algorithms","model parameterization"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Body Sensor Networks","Distributed","Hidden Markov Models","Segmentation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5226866/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 June 2009","displayDocTitle":"A Distributed Hidden Markov Model for Fine-grained Annotation in Body Sensor Networks","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5226866/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10844767","dateOfInsertion":"28 August 2009","conferenceDate":"3-5 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Distributed Hidden Markov Model for Fine-grained Annotation in Body Sensor Networks","confLoc":"Berkeley, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"3644a339.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060888S","chronDate":"3-5 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5226856","isNumber":"5226857","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5226856","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"5226857","articleId":"5226866","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5226888,"authors":[{"name":"Jongyoon Choi","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Texas A and M University, College Station, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Jongyoon","lastName":"Choi","id":"38262359400"},{"name":"Ricardo Gutierrez-Osuna","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Texas A and M University, College Station, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Ricardo","lastName":"Gutierrez-Osuna","id":"37281836900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3644-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2376-8886"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2376-8894"}],"articleNumber":"5226888","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":71,"citationCountPatent":4,"totalDownloads":1999},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Heart rate","Heart rate detection","Human factors","Wearable sensors","State estimation","Autonomic nervous system","Heart rate variability","System identification","Nonlinear dynamical systems","Psychology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biomedical telemetry","neurophysiology","patient monitoring","wearable computers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["heart rate monitor","mental stress detection","unobtrusive wearable sensors","autonomic nervous system","heart rate variability","principal dynamic modes","psychophysiological conditions"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["autonomic nervous system","heart rate variability","mental stress","wearable sensors","principal dynamic modes"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5226888","abstract":"This article describes an approach to detecting mental stress using unobtrusive wearable sensors. The approach relies on estimating the state of the autonomic nervous system from an analysis of heart rate variability. Namely, we use a non-linear system identification technique known as principal dynamic modes (PDM) to predict the activation level of the two autonomic branches: sympathetic (i.e. stress-inducing) and parasympathetic (i.e. relaxation-related). We validate the method on a discrimination problem with two psychophysiological conditions, one associated with mental tasks and one induced by relaxation exercises. Our results indicate that PDM features are more stable and less subject-dependent than spectral features, though the latter provide higher classification performance within subjects. When PDM and spectral features are combined, our system discriminates stressful events with a success rate of 83% within subjects (69% between subjects).","doi":"10.1109/BSN.2009.13","pdfPath":"/iel5/5226856/5226857/05226888.pdf","startPage":"219","endPage":"223","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Sixth International Workshop on Wearable and Implantable Body Sensor Networks","publicationTitle":"2009 Sixth International Workshop on Wearable and Implantable Body Sensor Networks","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/BSN.2009.13","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5226857","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Using Heart Rate Monitors to Detect Mental Stress","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5226888/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 June 2009","displayDocTitle":"Using Heart Rate Monitors to Detect Mental Stress","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"28 August 2009","accessionNumber":"10844788","publicationDate":"June 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5226888/","conferenceDate":"3-5 June 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Using Heart Rate Monitors to Detect Mental Stress","confLoc":"Berkeley, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"3644a219.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051722S","chronDate":"3-5 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5226856","isNumber":"5226857","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5226856","citationCount":"71","xplore-issue":"5226857","articleId":"5226888","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-09"},{"_id":5226893,"authors":[{"name":"Soumyajit Mandal","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering & Computer Science, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Soumyajit","lastName":"Mandal","id":"37265511700"},{"name":"Lorenzo Turicchia","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering & Computer Science, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Lorenzo","lastName":"Turicchia","id":"37426453100"},{"name":"Rahul Sarpeshkar","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering & Computer Science, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Rahul","lastName":"Sarpeshkar","id":"37272202000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3644-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2376-8886"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2376-8894"}],"articleNumber":"5226893","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":12,"citationCountPatent":3,"totalDownloads":714},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Battery-Free Tag for Wireless Monitoring of Heart Sounds","abstract":"We have developed a wearable, battery-free tag that monitors heart sounds. The tag powers up by harvesting ambient RF energy, and contains a low-power integrated circuit, an antenna and up to four microphones. The chip, which consumes only 1.0 uW of power, generates digital events when the outputs of any of the microphones exceeds a programmable threshold voltage, combines such events together by using a programmable logic array, and transmits them to a base station by using backscatter modulation. The chip can also be programmed to trade-off microphone sensitivity for power consumption. In this paper, we demonstrate that the tag, when attached to the chest, can reliably measure heart rate at distances up to 7 m from an FCC-compliant RF power source. We also suggest how delays between signals measured by microphones at the wrist and neck can be used to provide information about relative blood-pressure variations.","pdfPath":"/iel5/5226856/5226857/05226893.pdf","startPage":"201","endPage":"206","publicationTitle":"2009 Sixth International Workshop on Wearable and Implantable Body Sensor Networks","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5226857","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/BSN.2009.11","doi":"10.1109/BSN.2009.11","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Sixth International Workshop on Wearable and Implantable Body Sensor Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5226893","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Heart","Programmable logic arrays","Biomedical monitoring","Radio frequency","Microphone arrays","Semiconductor device measurement","Radiofrequency integrated circuits","Power generation","Threshold voltage","Base stations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biomedical electronics","biomedical ultrasonics","body area networks","cardiology","energy harvesting","low-power electronics","microphones","patient monitoring","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["battery-free tag","wireless monitoring","heart sound monitoring","wearable sensors","energy harvesting","ambient RF energy","low-power integrated circuit","antenna","microphones","programmable threshold voltage","programmable logic array","backscatter modulation","power consumption","FCC-compliant RF power source","wrist","neck","relative blood-pressure variation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["wireless health monitoring","wearable sensors","heart sounds","low power","battery-free"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 June 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5226893/","displayDocTitle":"A Battery-Free Tag for Wireless Monitoring of Heart Sounds","accessionNumber":"10844793","dateOfInsertion":"28 August 2009","publicationDate":"June 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5226893/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"3-5 June 2009","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Battery-Free Tag for Wireless Monitoring of Heart Sounds","confLoc":"Berkeley, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"3644a201.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044001S","chronDate":"3-5 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5226856","isNumber":"5226857","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5226856","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"5226857","articleId":"5226893","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":5226894,"authors":[{"name":"Mark A.

The proposed signal processing includes data normalization to improve robustness, feature extraction optimized for classification, and wavelet pre-processing. The effectiveness of the platform is validated by implementing a binary classifier between shuffle and normal gait. Artificial neural networks and classifiers based on the Cerebellar Model Articulation Controller were tested and yielded classification accuracies (68%-98%) comparable to previous efforts that required more restrictive or intrusive apparatus. These results suggest a viable path to resource-constrained, on-body gait classification.","doi":"10.1109/BSN.2009.48","startPage":"181","endPage":"186","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Sixth International Workshop on Wearable and Implantable Body Sensor Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/5226856/5226857/05226894.pdf","publicationTitle":"2009 Sixth International Workshop on Wearable and Implantable Body Sensor Networks","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/BSN.2009.48","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5226857","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Neural Network Gait Classification for On-Body Inertial Sensors","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Signal processing","Monitoring","Aging","Sensor phenomena and characterization","Wireless sensor networks","Robustness","Feature extraction","Artificial neural networks","Testing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biomedical telemetry","body area networks","brain","cerebellar model arithmetic computers","feature extraction","gait analysis","medical signal processing","neurophysiology","signal classification","wavelet transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["on-body inertial sensor","gait classification technique","body area sensor network platform","signal processing","wireless transmission","feature extraction","wavelet pre-processing","artificial neural network","cerebellar model articulation controller"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["neural network","gait classification","body area sensor network","linear acceleration","angular rate"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5226894/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 June 2009","displayDocTitle":"Neural Network Gait Classification for On-Body Inertial Sensors","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5226894/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","dateOfInsertion":"28 August 2009","conferenceDate":"3-5 June 2009","accessionNumber":"10844794","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Neural Network Gait Classification for On-Body Inertial Sensors","confLoc":"Berkeley, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"3644a181.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.110777S","chronDate":"3-5 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5226856","isNumber":"5226857","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5226856","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"5226857","articleId":"5226894","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":5226897,"authors":[{"name":"Louis Atallah","affiliation":["Department of Computing, Imperial College London, London, UK"],"firstName":"Louis","lastName":"Atallah","id":"37266371200"},{"name":"Omer Aziz","affiliation":["Department of Computing, Imperial College London, London, UK"],"firstName":"Omer","lastName":"Aziz","id":"37889076300"},{"name":"Benny Lo","affiliation":["Department of Computing, Imperial College London, London, UK"],"firstName":"Benny","lastName":"Lo","id":"38183567000"},{"name":"Guang-Zhong Yang","affiliation":["Department of Biosurgery and Surgical Technology, Imperial College London, London, UK"],"firstName":"Guang-Zhong","lastName":"Yang","id":"38183287000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3644-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2376-8886"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2376-8894"}],"articleNumber":"5226897","dbTime":"14 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":34,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":349},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Legged locomotion","Injuries","Leg","Ear","Wearable sensors","Feature extraction","Wavelet analysis","Abdomen","Surgery","Source separation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biomedical measurement","body area networks","feature extraction","gait analysis","medical disorders","medical signal detection","pattern classification","wavelet transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["walking gait impairment detection","ear-worn sensor","gait analysis","feature extraction","multiresolution wavelet analysis","margin based feature selection","leg injury","abdominal impairment","source separation","pattern classification"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["wearable sensors","gait","wavelet analysis"]}],"abstract":"This paper investigates an ear worn sensor for the development of a gait analysis framework. Instead of explicitly defining gait features that indicate injury or impairment, an automatic method of feature extraction and selection is proposed. The proposed framework uses multi-resolution wavelet analysis and margin based feature selection. It was validated on three datasets; the first simulating a leg injury, the second simulating abdominal impairment that could result from surgery or injury and the third is a dataset collected from a patient during recovery from leg injury. The method shows a clear distinction of gait between injured and normal walking. It also illustrates the fact that using source separation before pattern classification can significantly improve the proposed gait analysis framework.","doi":"10.1109/BSN.2009.41","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Sixth International Workshop on Wearable and Implantable Body Sensor Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/5226856/5226857/05226897.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5226857","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/BSN.2009.41","publicationTitle":"2009 Sixth International Workshop on Wearable and Implantable Body Sensor Networks","startPage":"175","endPage":"180","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Detecting Walking Gait Impairment with an Ear-worn Sensor","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5226897","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 June 2009","displayDocTitle":"Detecting Walking Gait Impairment with an Ear-worn Sensor","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5226897/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5226897/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10844797","dateOfInsertion":"28 August 2009","conferenceDate":"3-5 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Detecting Walking Gait Impairment with an Ear-worn Sensor","confLoc":"Berkeley, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"3644a175.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057128S","chronDate":"3-5 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5226856","isNumber":"5226857","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5226856","citationCount":"34","xplore-issue":"5226857","articleId":"5226897","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5226900,"authors":[{"name":"Pawan K.

Commercial pulse oximeter sensors consume about 20-60 mW of power during continuous operation. Other researchers have shown that accurate and noise robust wireless pulse oximeter sensors can be designed to operate with as little as 1.5 mW. The LEDs consume bulk of the power budget in pulse oximeter sensors. In this work, we describe a compressed sensing approach to sample the photodetector output, so that the LEDs can be turned off for longer periods and thus save sensor power. We randomly sample Photoplethysmogram (PPG) signals with about 10-40x fewer samples than with uniform sampling and demonstrate that the accuracy of heart rate estimation and blood pressure estimation are not compromised, using MIMIC database.

Therefore, many fall detection systems have been developed. However, prevalent methods only use accelerometers to isolate falls from activities of daily living (ADL). This makes it difficult to distinguish real falls from certain fall-like activities such as sitting down quickly and jumping, resulting in many false positives. Body orientation is also used as a means of detecting falls, but it is not very useful when the ending position is not horizontal, e.g. falls happen on stairs. In this paper we present a novel fall detection system using both accelerometers and gyroscopes. We divide human activities into two categories: static postures and dynamic transitions. By using two tri-axial accelerometers at separate body locations, our system can recognize four kinds of static postures: standing, bending, sitting, and lying. Motions between these static postures are considered as dynamic transitions. Linear acceleration and angular velocity are measured to determine whether motion transitions are intentional. If the transition before a lying posture is not intentional, a fall event is detected. Our algorithm, coupled with accelerometers and gyroscopes, reduces both false positives and false negatives, while improving fall detection accuracy. In addition, our solution features low computational cost and real-time response.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Accurate, Fast Fall Detection Using Gyroscopes and Accelerometer-Derived Posture Information","publicationTitle":"2009 Sixth International Workshop on Wearable and Implantable Body Sensor Networks","doi":"10.1109/BSN.2009.46","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Sixth International Workshop on Wearable and Implantable Body Sensor Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/5226856/5226857/05226903.pdf","startPage":"138","endPage":"143","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/BSN.2009.46","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5226857","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5226903","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5226903/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 June 2009","displayDocTitle":"Accurate, Fast Fall Detection Using Gyroscopes and Accelerometer-Derived Posture Information","conferenceDate":"3-5 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5226903/","dateOfInsertion":"28 August 2009","publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10844803","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Accurate, Fast Fall Detection Using Gyroscopes and Accelerometer-Derived Posture Information","confLoc":"Berkeley, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"3644a138.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.084321S","chronDate":"3-5 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5226856","isNumber":"5226857","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5226856","citationCount":"254","xplore-issue":"5226857","articleId":"5226903","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-02"},{"_id":5226907,"authors":[{"name":"Federico S.

Our aim is to evaluate the performance of such a method using the available MIMIC database, while at the same time improve the performance of existing techniques. We propose an algorithm to estimate BP from a combination of PAT and heart rate, showing improvement over PAT alone.

That means patient data could be transmitted to a medical facility via the cellular network eliminating the need to build expensive specialised communication links. But while Bluetooth low energy specification promises much, there are some technical challenges - such as protection of privacy - to overcome.","doi":"10.1109/BSN.2009.68","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5226857","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/BSN.2009.68","publicationTitle":"2009 Sixth International Workshop on Wearable and Implantable Body Sensor Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Sixth International Workshop on Wearable and Implantable Body Sensor Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/5226856/5226857/05226914.pdf","startPage":"65","endPage":"70","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reducing Healthcare Costs with Wireless Technology","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"3-5 June 2009","displayDocTitle":"Reducing Healthcare Costs with Wireless Technology","isConference":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 June 2009","dateOfInsertion":"28 August 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5226914/","publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10844814","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5226914/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reducing Healthcare Costs with Wireless Technology","confLoc":"Berkeley, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"3644a065.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057292S","chronDate":"3-5 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5226856","isNumber":"5226857","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5226856","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"5226857","articleId":"5226914","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5226915,"authors":[{"name":"Adam T.

Since both of these quantities depend on the spatial location of the nodes, mathematical techniques have been developed in the last decade to provide communication-theoretic results accounting for the networks geometrical configuration. Often, the location of the nodes in the network can be modeled as random, following for example a Poisson point process. In this case, different techniques based on stochastic geometry and the theory of random geometric graphs -including point process theory, percolation theory, and probabilistic combinatorics-have led to results on the connectivity, the capacity, the outage probability, and other fundamental limits of wireless networks. This tutorial article surveys some of these techniques, discusses their application to model wireless networks, and presents some of the main results that have appeared in the literature. It also serves as an introduction to the field for the other papers in this special issue.","doi":"10.1109/JSAC.2009.090902","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5226953","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2009.090902","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/49/5226953/05226957.pdf","startPage":"1029","endPage":"1046","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Stochastic geometry and random graphs for the analysis and design of wireless networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 August 2009","displayDocTitle":"Stochastic geometry and random graphs for the analysis and design of wireless networks","volume":"27","issue":"7","chronOrPublicationDate":"September  2009","dateOfInsertion":"28 August 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5226957/","publicationDate":"September 2009","accessionNumber":"10847168","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5226957/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Stochastic geometry and random graphs for the analysis and design of wireless networks","sourcePdf":"1029jsac0709haenggi.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.160502S","chronDate":"September  2009","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"5226953","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"1171","xplore-issue":"5226953","articleId":"5226957","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5226961,"authors":[{"name":"Hazer Inaltekin","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Princeton University, Princeton, NJ, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/49/5226953/5226961/5226961-photo-2-source-small.gif","p":["Hazer Inaltekin (S'04, M'06) received his B.S. degree with High Honors from the Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering at Bogazici University, Istanbul, Turkey, in 2001.

This model is often used along with a random uniform node distribution, even though in a group of uniformly distributed nodes some may be arbitrarily close to one another. The unbounded path-loss model is compared to a more realistic bounded path-loss model, and it is shown that the effect of the singularity on the total network interference level is significant and cannot be disregarded when nodes are uniformly distributed. A phase transition phenomenon occurring in the interference behavior is analyzed in detail. Several performance metrics are also examined by using the computed interference distributions.

In particular, we show that the widely observed unfairness of these protocols in small network topologies does not always persist in large topologies. In regular networks, this unfairness is essentially due to the unfair advantage of nodes at the border of the network, which have a restricted neighborhood and thus a higher probability to access the communication channel. In large 1D lattice networks these border effects do not propagate inside the network, and nodes sufficiently far away from the border have equal access to the channel; as a result the protocol is long-term fair. In 2D lattice networks, we observe a phase transition. If the access intensity of the protocol is small, the border effects remain local and the protocol behaves similarly as in one-dimensional networks. However, if the access intensity of the protocol is large enough, the border effects persist independently of the size of the network and the protocol is strongly unfair. In irregular networks, the topology is inherently unfair. This unfairness increases with the access intensity of the protocol, but in a much smoother way than in regular two-dimensional networks. Finally, in situations where the protocol is long-term fair, we provide a characterization of its short-term fairness.","doi":"10.1109/JSAC.2009.090907","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/49/5226953/05226962.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2009.090907","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5226953","startPage":"1093","endPage":"1104","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the fairness of large CSMA networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5226962","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"On the fairness of large CSMA networks","chronOrPublicationDate":"September  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5226962/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 August 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"27","issue":"7","publicationDate":"September 2009","accessionNumber":"10847173","dateOfInsertion":"28 August 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5226962/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the fairness of large CSMA networks","sourcePdf":"1093jsac0709durvy.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.07853S","chronDate":"September  2009","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"5226953","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"29","xplore-issue":"5226953","articleId":"5226962","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5226963,"authors":[{"name":"Francois Baccelli","affiliation":["INRIA/ENS, Paris, France"],"bio":{"p":["Fran\u00e7ois Baccelli's research interests are in the theory of discrete event dynamical networks and in the modeling and performance evaluation of computer and communication systems.

In a network where stations are randomly and homogeneously located in the Euclidean plane, there is a way to tune the bias of the coin so as to obtain the best possible compromise between spatial reuse and per transmitter throughput. This paper shows how to address this questions using stochastic geometry and more precisely Poisson shot noise field theory. The theory that is developed is fully computational and leads to new closed form expressions for various kinds of spatial averages (like e.g. outage, throughput or transport). It also allows one to derive general scaling laws that hold for general fading assumptions. We exemplify its flexibility by analyzing a natural variant of Spatial Aloha that we call Opportunistic Aloha and that consists in replacing the coin tossing by an evaluation of the quality of the channel of each station to its receiver and a selection of the stations with good channels (e.g. fading) conditions. We show how to adapt the general machinery to this variant and how to optimize and implement it.

The power of nearest interferer is used as a major performance indicator, instead of a traditionally-used total interference power, since at the low outage region, they have the same statistics so that the former is an accurate approximation of the latter. This simplifies the problem significantly and allows one to develop a unified framework for the outage probability analysis, including the impacts of complete/partial interference cancellation, of different types of fading and of linear filtering, either alone or in combination with each other. When a given number of nearest interferers are completely canceled, the outage probability is shown to scale down exponentially in this number. Three different models of partial cancellation are considered and compared via their outage probabilities. The partial cancellation level required to eliminate the impact of an interferer is quantified. The effect of a broad class of fading processes (including all popular fading models) is included in the analysis in a straightforward way, which can be positive or negative depending on a particular model and propagation/system parameters. The positive effect of linear filtering (e.g. by directional antennas) is quantified via a new statistical selectivity parameter. The analysis results in formulation of a tradeoff relationship between the network density and the outage probability, which is a result of the interplay between random geometry of node locations, the propagation path loss and the distortion effects at the victim receiver.","doi":"10.1109/JSAC.2009.090909","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/49/5226953/05226964.pdf","startPage":"1120","endPage":"1131","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2009.090909","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5226953","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On node density - outage probability tradeoff in wireless networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5226964","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 August 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"September  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5226964/","displayDocTitle":"On node density - outage probability tradeoff in wireless networks","volume":"27","issue":"7","publicationDate":"September 2009","accessionNumber":"10847175","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5226964/","dateOfInsertion":"28 August 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On node density - outage probability tradeoff in wireless networks","sourcePdf":"1120jsac0709loyka.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.075724S","chronDate":"September  2009","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"5226953","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"54","xplore-issue":"5226953","articleId":"5226964","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5226966,"authors":[{"name":"Giusi Alfano","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Elettronica, Politecnico di Turino, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/49/5226953/5226966/5226966-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Giusi Alfano was born in Naples, Italy, on march 22, 1978.

Unlike most previous works that do not consider the impacts of transmission latency, which is critical for real time applications, this paper identifies the quantitative relationship between network connectivity and delay constraint. The results are applicable to both delay constrained networks and delay tolerant networks. The connectivity analysis is performed with a novel geometry-assisted analytical method. Exact connectivity probability expressions are developed by using the volumes of a hypercube intersected by a hyperplane, and a hyperpyramid.

We consider how such cooperation affects the requirements for full connectivity and percolation in large wireless ad hoc networks. Both noncoherent and coherent cooperative transmission are considered. For one-dimensional (1-D) extended networks, in contrast to noncooperative networks, for any path loss exponent less than or equal to one, full connectivity occurs under the noncoherent cooperation model with probability one for any node density. Conversely, there is no full connectivity with probability one when the path loss exponent exceeds one, and the network does not percolate for any node density if the path loss exponent exceeds two. In two-dimensional (2-D) extended networks with noncoherent cooperation, for any path loss exponent less than or equal to two, full connectivity is achieved for any node density. Conversely, there is no full connectivity when the path loss exponent exceeds two, but the cooperative network percolates for node densities above a threshold which is strictly less than that of the noncooperative network. A less conclusive set of results is presented for the coherent case. Hence, even relatively simple noncoherent cooperation improves the connectivity of large ad hoc networks.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"September  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5226973/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 August 2009","volume":"27","issue":"7","accessionNumber":"10847184","publicationDate":"September 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5226973/","dateOfInsertion":"28 August 2009","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Asymptotic connectivity properties of cooperative wireless ad hoc networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Asymptotic connectivity properties of cooperative wireless ad hoc networks","sourcePdf":"1226jsac0709goeckel.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.077852S","chronDate":"September  2009","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"5226953","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"5226953","articleId":"5226973","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5226976,"authors":[{"name":"Kaibin Huang","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Yonsei University, Seoul, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/49/5226953/5226976/5226976-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Kaibin Huang (S '05-M'08) received the B.Eng.

To improve the usual underutilization of the cellular uplink spectrum, this paper addresses spectrum sharing between a cellular uplink and a mobile ad hoc networks. These networks access either all frequency subchannels or their disjoint subsets, called spectrum underlay and spectrum overlay, respectively. Given these spectrum sharing methods, the capacity trade-off between the coexisting networks is analyzed based on the transmission capacity of a network with Poisson distributed transmitters. This metric is defined as the maximum density of transmitters subject to an outage constraint for a given signal-to-interference ratio (SIR). Using tools from stochastic geometry, the transmission-capacity trade-off between the coexisting networks is analyzed, where both spectrum overlay and underlay as well as successive interference cancellation (SIC) are considered. In particular, for small target outage probability, the transmission capacities of the coexisting networks are proved to satisfy a linear equation, whose coefficients depend on the spectrum sharing method and whether SIC is applied. This linear equation shows that spectrum overlay is more efficient than spectrum underlay. Furthermore, this result also provides insight into the effects of network parameters on transmission capacities, including link diversity gains, transmission distances, and the base station density. In particular, SIC is shown to increase the transmission capacities of both coexisting networks by a linear factor, which depends on the interference-power threshold for qualifying canceled interferers.","doi":"10.1109/JSAC.2009.090921","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/49/5226953/05226976.pdf","startPage":"1256","endPage":"1267","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2009.090921","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5226953","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Spectrum sharing between cellular and mobile ad hoc networks: transmission-capacity trade-off","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 August 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5226976/","chronOrPublicationDate":"September  2009","displayDocTitle":"Spectrum sharing between cellular and mobile ad hoc networks: transmission-capacity trade-off","dateOfInsertion":"28 August 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5226976/","accessionNumber":"10847187","volume":"27","issue":"7","publicationDate":"September 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spectrum sharing between cellular and mobile ad hoc networks: transmission-capacity trade-off","sourcePdf":"1256jsac0709huang.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.082486S","chronDate":"September  2009","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"5226953","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"166","xplore-issue":"5226953","articleId":"5226976","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5226977,"authors":[{"name":"Pedro C.

In this paper, we put forth a mathematical model for coexistence in networks composed of both narrowband (NB) and ultrawideband (UWB) wireless nodes, based on fundamental tools from stochastic geometry. Our model considers that the interferers are spatially scattered according to a Poisson field, and are operating asynchronously in a wireless environment. We first determine the statistical distribution of the aggregate interference for both cases of NB and UWB emitters. We then provide error probability expressions for two dual configurations: 1) a NB victim link subject to the aggregate UWB interference, and 2) a UWB victim link subject to the aggregate NB interference. The results show that while the impact of a single interferer on a link is often negligible due to restrictions on the transmitted power, the aggregate effect of multiple interferers may cause significant degradation. Therefore, aggregate interference must be considered to ensure coexistence in heterogeneous networks. The proposed analytical framework shows good agreement with physical-level simulations of the system.","doi":"10.1109/JSAC.2009.090922","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/49/5226953/05226977.pdf","startPage":"1268","endPage":"1282","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2009.090922","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5226953","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A stochastic geometry approach to coexistence in heterogeneous wireless networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5226977","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 August 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"September  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5226977/","displayDocTitle":"A stochastic geometry approach to coexistence in heterogeneous wireless networks","volume":"27","issue":"7","publicationDate":"September 2009","accessionNumber":"10847188","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5226977/","dateOfInsertion":"28 August 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A stochastic geometry approach to coexistence in heterogeneous wireless networks","sourcePdf":"1268jsac0709pinto.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.129479S","chronDate":"September  2009","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"5226953","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"72","xplore-issue":"5226953","articleId":"5226977","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":5226978,"authors":[{"name":"Wei Ren","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of California, Davis, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/49/5226953/5226978/5226978-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Wei Ren (S'07) received the B.Sc. degree in 2003 and the M.Sc. degree in 2006, both from Peking University, China.

Such analytical characterizations allow us to study power control for optimal transport throughput under constraints on the interference to primary users.

However, in energy-constrained ad hoc wireless networks (e.g., sensor networks), energy is a critical factor in measuring the efficiency of a distributed algorithm. Transmitting a message between two nodes has an associated cost (energy) and moreover this cost can depend on the two nodes (e.g., the distance between them among other things). Thus in addition to the time and message complexity, it is important to consider energy complexity that accounts for the total energy associated with the messages exchanged among the nodes in a distributed algorithm. This paper addresses the minimum spanning tree (MST) problem, a fundamental problem in distributed computing and communication networks. We study energy-efficient distributed algorithms for the Euclidean MST problem assuming random distribution of nodes. We show a non-trivial lower bound of \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">\u03a9(log n)</i>\n on the energy complexity of any distributed MST algorithm. We then give an energy-optimal distributed algorithm that constructs an optimal MST with energy complexity \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">O(log n)</i>\n on average and \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">O(log n log log n)</i>\n with high probability. This is an improvement over the previous best known bound on the average energy complexity of \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">\u03a9(log<sup>2</sup>). Our energy-optimal algorithm exploits a novel property of the giant component of sparse random geometric graphs. All of the above results assume that nodes do not know their geometric coordinates. If the nodes know their own coordinates, then we give an algorithm with <i>O(1)</i> energy complexity (which is the best possible) that gives an <i>O(1)</i> approximation to the MST.</i>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/49/5226953/05226979.pdf","startPage":"1297","endPage":"1304","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","doi":"10.1109/JSAC.2009.090924","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2009.090924","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5226953","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5226979","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Energy-Optimal Distributed Algorithms for Minimum Spanning Trees","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Distributed algorithms","Wireless sensor networks","Costs","Time measurement","Distributed computing","Energy efficiency","Energy measurement","Communication networks","Approximation algorithms","Tree graphs"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ad hoc networks","communication complexity","distributed algorithms","telecommunication computing","trees (mathematics)","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed algorithms","minimum spanning trees","ad hoc wireless networks","energy efficiency","energy complexity","message exchanging","Euclidean MST problem","random distribution","energy-optimal algorithm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Distributed Algorithm, Minimum Spanning Tree, Energy-Efficient, Random Geometric Graph, Percolation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5226979/","chronOrPublicationDate":"September  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 August 2009","displayDocTitle":"Energy-Optimal Distributed Algorithms for Minimum Spanning Trees","volume":"27","issue":"7","htmlLink":"/document/5226979/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"September 2009","accessionNumber":"10847190","dateOfInsertion":"28 August 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy-Optimal Distributed Algorithms for Minimum Spanning Trees","sourcePdf":"1297jsac0709choi.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.103285S","chronDate":"September  2009","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"5226953","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"5226953","articleId":"5226979","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5227026,"authors":[{"name":"Yuan-Hao Chang","affiliation":["Graduate Institute of Networking and Multimedia Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Yuan-Hao","lastName":"Chang","id":"37537830500"},{"name":"Tei-Wei Kuo","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering Graduate Institute of Networking and Multimedia, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Tei-Wei","lastName":"Kuo","id":"37276775300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-6055-8497-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0738-100X"}],"articleNumber":"5227026","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":5,"totalDownloads":231},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Flash memory","Error correction codes","Computer network reliability","Multimedia systems","Computer science","Reliability engineering","Costs","Read-write memory","Drives","File systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["flash memories","random-access storage","reliability theory","storage management chips"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["commitment-based management strategy","performance enhancement","reliability enhancement","flash-memory storage systems","flash memory technology","three-level address translation architecture","adaptive block mapping mechanism","address translation process","RAM usage","multiple chips","write constraints","multilevel-cell flash memory chips"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Secondary storage","embedded systems","flash memory","performance","reliability"]}],"abstract":"Cost has been a major driving force in the development of the flash memory technology, but has also introduced serious challenges on reliability and performance for future products.

The basic idea is to use floorplanning to guide the placement of objects at the global level. The flow consists of four steps: (1) The objects in the original netlist are clustered into blocks; (2) Floorplanning is performed on the blocks; (3) The blocks are shifted within the chip region to further optimize the wirelength; (4) With big macro locations fixed, incremental placement is applied to place the remaining objects. There are several advantages of handling placement at the global level with a floorplanning technique. First, the problem size can be significantly reduced. Second, exact HPWL can be minimized. Third, precise object distribution can be achieved so that legalization only needs to handle minor overlaps among small objects in a block. Fourth, rotation and various placement constraints on macros can be handled. To demonstrate the effectiveness of this new flow, we implement a high-quality floorplan-guided placer called FLOP. We also construct the Modern Mixed-Size (MMS) placement benchmarks which can effectively represent the complexities of modern mixed-size designs and the challenges faced by modern mixed-size placers. Compared with state-of-the-art mixed-size placers and leading macro placers, experimental results show that FLOP achieves the best wirelength, and easily obtains legal solutions on all circuits.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1145/1629911.1630028","doi":"10.1145/1629911.1630028","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 46th ACM/IEEE Design Automation Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5209519/5227020/05227031.pdf","startPage":"436","endPage":"441","publicationTitle":"2009 46th ACM/IEEE Design Automation Conference","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5227020","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Handling complexities in modern large-scale mixed-size placement","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Handling complexities in modern large-scale mixed-size placement","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5227031/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-31 July 2009","conferenceDate":"26-31 July 2009","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2009","accessionNumber":"10844419","dateOfInsertion":"28 August 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5227031/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Handling complexities in modern large-scale mixed-size placement","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"090.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060848S","chronDate":"26-31 July 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5209519","isNumber":"5227020","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5209519","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"5227020","articleId":"5227031","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ACM","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5227032,"authors":[{"name":"Chen Huang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of California, Riverside, USA"],"firstName":"Chen","lastName":"Huang","id":"37539982300"},{"name":"Frank Vahid","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of California, Riverside, USA"],"firstName":"Frank","lastName":"Vahid","id":"37267281100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-6055-8497-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0738-100X"}],"articleNumber":"5227032","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":170},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Coprocessors","Field programmable gate arrays","Runtime","Embedded computing","Application specific integrated circuits","Robustness","Acceleration","Scheduling algorithm","Computer architecture","Signal processing algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["coprocessors","field programmable gate arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["transmuting coprocessors","dynamic loading","FPGA coprocessors","field-programmable gates arrays","general-purpose computing platforms","microprocessors","dynamic management problems","Intel FSB-FPGA architecture","memory contention","online algorithm","AG algorithm","static coprocessor loading approach"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["FPGAs","dynamic optimization","runtime configuration","coprocessing","acceleration","online algorithms"]}],"abstract":"Field-programmable gates arrays (FPGAs) are increasingly used in general-purpose computing platforms to augment microprocessors, enabling runtime loading of coprocessors customized to speed up some applications. Such transmuting coprocessors create new dynamic management problems involving decisions as to when to load a coprocessor, where to place the coprocessor in the FPGA, or which resident coprocessor to replace. We define a transmuting coprocessor problem based on Intel's FSB-FPGA architecture, with attention on communication and memory contention. We develop an online algorithm to manage coprocessor loading, the AG algorithm, which uses aggregated gains to guide coprocessor load, placement, replacement, and wait decisions. Experiments using embedded system applications, for random, biased, and periodic input application sequences, a range of reconfiguration times, and different FPGA types with different numbers of partial reconfigurable regions, demonstrate that the AG algorithm is robust across a variety of situations. The AG algorithm results are within 15% of an unlimited-size FPGA on average, exhibit a small standard deviation, and show a 1.4times speedup versus a static coprocessor loading approach and a 3times speedup over execution on a microprocessor-only solution.","publicationTitle":"2009 46th ACM/IEEE Design Automation Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 46th ACM/IEEE Design Automation Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5209519/5227020/05227032.pdf","startPage":"848","endPage":"851","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5227020","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5227032","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Transmuting coprocessors: Dynamic loading of FPGA coprocessors","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-31 July 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5227032/","displayDocTitle":"Transmuting coprocessors: Dynamic loading of FPGA coprocessors","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5227032/","publicationDate":"July 2009","dateOfInsertion":"28 August 2009","conferenceDate":"26-31 July 2009","accessionNumber":"10844420","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Transmuting coprocessors: Dynamic loading of FPGA coprocessors","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"169.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061379S","chronDate":"26-31 July 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5209519","isNumber":"5227020","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5209519","xplore-issue":"5227020","articleId":"5227032","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ACM","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5227035,"authors":[{"name":"Amirhossein Alimohammad","affiliation":["Ukalta Engineering, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada"],"firstName":"Amirhossein","lastName":"Alimohammad","id":"37295113600"},{"name":"Saeed F.

Excessive runtime thermal variations compromise the performance and reliability of integrated circuits. To address these thermal issues, state of the art chips have integrated thermal sensors that monitor temperatures at a few selected die locations. These temperature measurements are then used by thermal management techniques to appropriately manage chip performance. Thermal sensors and their support circuitry incur design overheads, die area, and manufacturing costs. In this paper, we propose a new direction for full thermal characterization of integrated circuits based on spectral Fourier analysis techniques. Application of these techniques to temperature sensing is based on the observation that die temperature is simply a space varying signal, and that space varying signals are treated identically to time varying signals in signal analysis. We utilize Nyquist-Shannon sampling theory to devise methods that can almost fully reconstruct the thermal status of an integrated circuit during runtime using a minimal number of thermal sensors. We propose methods that can handle uniform and non uniform thermal sensor placements. We develop an extensive experimental setup and demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods by thermally characterizing a 16-core processor.

A controlled sampling scheme and a nested Monte Carlo analysis method are then applied for the failure probability extraction at cell-level and array-level respectively.

As feature sizes near the atomic scale, extensive variation and wearout inevitably make margining uneconomical or impossible. The ElastIC project seeks to address this by creating a large-scale chip-multiprocessor that can self-diagnose, adapt, and heal. Creating large, flexible designs in this environment naturally lends itself to the repetitive nature of network-on-chip (NoC), but the loss of a single link or router will result in complete network failure. In this work we present Vicis, an ElastIC-style NoC that can tolerate the loss of many network components due to wearout induced hard faults. Vicis uses the inherent redundancy in the network and its routers in order to maintain correct operation while incurring a much lower area overhead than previously proposed N-modular redundancy (NMR) based solutions. Each router has a built-in-self-test (BIST) that diagnoses the locations of hard fault and runs a number of algorithms to best use ECC, port swapping, and a crossbar bypass bus to mitigate them. The routers work together to run distributed algorithms to solve network-wide problems as well, protecting the networking against critical failures in individual routers. In this work we show that with stuck-at fault rates as high as 1 in 2000 gates, Vicis will continue to operate with approximately half of its routers still functional and communicating.","doi":"10.1145/1629911.1630119","publicationTitle":"2009 46th ACM/IEEE Design Automation Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 46th ACM/IEEE Design Automation Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5209519/5227020/05227053.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1145/1629911.1630119","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5227020","startPage":"812","endPage":"817","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Vicis: A reliable network for unreliable silicon","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5227053","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Vicis: A reliable network for unreliable silicon","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-31 July 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5227053/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"26-31 July 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2009","accessionNumber":"10844440","dateOfInsertion":"28 August 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5227053/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Vicis: A reliable network for unreliable silicon","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"162.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051113S","chronDate":"26-31 July 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5209519","isNumber":"5227020","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5209519","citationCount":"91","xplore-issue":"5227020","articleId":"5227053","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ACM","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5227060,"authors":[{"name":"Dragoljub Gagi Drmanac","affiliation":["University of California, Santa Barbara, USA"],"firstName":"Dragoljub Gagi","lastName":"Drmanac","id":"37403304000"},{"name":"Frank Liu","affiliation":["IBM Austin Research Laboratory, USA"],"firstName":"Frank","lastName":"Liu","id":"37275916700"},{"name":"Li-C.

In this work, we propose the first event driven logic simulator accelerated by a parallel, general purpose graphics processor (GPGPU). Our simulator leverages a gate level event driven design to exploit the benefits of the low switching activity that is typical of large hardware designs. We developed novel algorithms for circuit netlist partitioning and optimized for a highly parallel GPGPU host. Moreover, our flow is structured to extract the best simulation performance from the target hardware platform.

The key innovation in our proposed work is a hybrid memory array, which is mixture of conventional 6T and 8T SRAM bit-cells. The fundamental premise of our approach lies in the fact that human visual system (HVS) is mostly sensitive to higher order bits of luminance pixels in video data. We implemented a preferential storage policy in which the higher order luma bits are stored in robust 8T bit-cells while the lower order bits are stored in conventional 6T bit-cells. This facilitates aggressive scaling of supply voltage in memory as the important luma bits, stored in 8T bit-cells, remain relatively unaffected by voltage scaling. The not-so-important lower order luma bits, stored in 6T bit-cells, if affected, contribute insignificantly to the overall degradation in output video quality. Simulation results show average power savings of up to 56%, in the hybrid memory array compared to the conventional 6T SRAM array implemented in 65nm CMOS. The area overhead and maximum output quality degradation (PSNR) incurred were 11.5% and 0.56 dB, respectively.","publicationTitle":"2009 46th ACM/IEEE Design Automation Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 46th ACM/IEEE Design Automation Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5209519/5227020/05227102.pdf","startPage":"670","endPage":"675","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A voltage-scalable & process variation resilient hybrid SRAM architecture for MPEG-4 video processors","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5227020","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5227102","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5227102/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-31 July 2009","displayDocTitle":"A voltage-scalable & process variation resilient hybrid SRAM architecture for MPEG-4 video processors","dateOfInsertion":"28 August 2009","publicationDate":"July 2009","accessionNumber":"10844489","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"26-31 July 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5227102/","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A voltage-scalable & process variation resilient hybrid SRAM architecture for MPEG-4 video processors","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"137.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.082015S","chronDate":"26-31 July 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5209519","isNumber":"5227020","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5209519","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5227020","articleId":"5227102","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ACM","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5227103,"authors":[{"name":"Ryan Helinski","affiliation":["University of New Mexico, Albuquerque, NM, USA"],"firstName":"Ryan","lastName":"Helinski","id":"37542080200"},{"name":"Dhruva Acharyya","affiliation":["Verigy, Inc., Cupertino, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Dhruva","lastName":"Acharyya","id":"37298437600"},{"name":"Jim Plusquellic","affiliation":["University of New Mexico, Albuquerque, NM, USA"],"firstName":"Jim","lastName":"Plusquellic","id":"37330239000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-6055-8497-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0738-100X"}],"articleNumber":"5227103","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":29,"citationCountPatent":10,"totalDownloads":623},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power distribution","Hardware","Communication system security","Data security","Power system security","Application specific integrated circuits","Authentication","Cryptography","Communication channels","Power system protection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cryptography","integrated circuit design","microprocessor chips","power aware computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["physically unclonable function","power distribution system","hardware security application","silicon-derived secret key","measured equivalent resistance variation","integrated circuit authentication"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Hardware security","unique identifier","process variations"]}],"abstract":"For hardware security applications, the availability of secret keys is a critical component for secure activation, IC authentication and for other important applications including encryption of communication channels and IP protection in FPGAs.

More specifically, we demonstrate that each processor design can be authenticated by requiring a checksum incorporating internals of complex microarchitectural mechanisms to be computed within a time limit; this checksum is different for each processor model and only authentic secure hardware can obtain the checksum fast enough. This new authentication approach provides attractive solutions to privacy, scaling, and security issues of traditional approaches that otherwise rely only on certificates. Architectural simulations and an RTL implementation show that the proposed approach is viable with very low hardware overheads.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"26-31 July 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5227105/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5227105/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10844492","conferenceDate":"26-31 July 2009","publicationDate":"July 2009","dateOfInsertion":"28 August 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Hardware authentication leveraging performance limits in detailed simulations and emulations","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hardware authentication leveraging performance limits in detailed simulations and emulations","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"139.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054525S","chronDate":"26-31 July 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5209519","isNumber":"5227020","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5209519","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"5227020","articleId":"5227105","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ACM","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5227106,"authors":[{"name":"Miodrag Potkonjak","affiliation":["Computer Science Department, University of California, Los Angeles, USA"],"firstName":"Miodrag","lastName":"Potkonjak","id":"37279233100"},{"name":"Ani Nahapetian","affiliation":["Computer Science Department, University of California, Los Angeles, USA"],"firstName":"Ani","lastName":"Nahapetian","id":"37298478500"},{"name":"Michael Nelson","affiliation":["Computer Science Department, University of California, Los Angeles, USA"],"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Nelson","id":"37890604700"},{"name":"Tammara Massey","affiliation":["Computer Science Department, University of California, Los Angeles, USA"],"firstName":"Tammara","lastName":"Massey","id":"37603045400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-6055-8497-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0738-100X"}],"articleNumber":"5227106","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":112,"citationCountPatent":14,"totalDownloads":1869},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5227106","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hardware","Invasive software","Foundries","Software libraries","Testing","Data security","Data privacy","Application software","Research and development","Manufacturing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["integrated circuits","invasive software","linear programming","logic gates","power aware computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hardware Trojan horse detection","gate level characterization","hardware specification","linear programming","nondestructive power measurements"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Hardware Trojan horses","gate-level characterization","linear programming","manufacturing variability"]}],"abstract":"Hardware Trojan horses (HTHs) are the malicious altering of hardware specification or implementation in such a way that its functionality is altered under a set of conditions defined by the attacker. There are numerous HTHs sources including untrusted foundries, synthesis tools and libraries, testing and verification tools, and configuration scripts. HTH attacks can greatly comprise security and privacy of hardware users either directly or through interaction with pertinent systems and application software or with data. However, while there has been a huge research and development effort for detecting software Trojan horses, surprisingly, HTHs are rarely addressed. HTH detection is a particularly difficult task in modern and pending deep submicron technologies due to intrinsic manufacturing variability. Our goal is to provide an impetus for HTH research by creating a generic and easily applicable set of techniques and tools for HTH detection. We start by introducing a technique for recovery of characteristics of gates in terms of leakage current, switching power, and delay, which utilizes linear programming to solve a system of equations created using nondestructive measurements of power or delays. This technique is combined with constraint manipulation techniques to detect embedded HTHs. The effectiveness of the approach is demonstrated on a number of standard benchmarks.","doi":"10.1145/1629911.1630091","publicationTitle":"2009 46th ACM/IEEE Design Automation Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 46th ACM/IEEE Design Automation Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5209519/5227020/05227106.pdf","startPage":"688","endPage":"693","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1145/1629911.1630091","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5227020","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hardware Trojan horse detection using gate-level characterization","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5227106/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-31 July 2009","displayDocTitle":"Hardware Trojan horse detection using gate-level characterization","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2009","accessionNumber":"10844493","htmlLink":"/document/5227106/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"28 August 2009","conferenceDate":"26-31 July 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hardware Trojan horse detection using gate-level characterization","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"140.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.076134S","chronDate":"26-31 July 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5209519","isNumber":"5227020","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5209519","citationCount":"112","xplore-issue":"5227020","articleId":"5227106","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ACM","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5227114,"authors":[{"name":"Hong Zhang","affiliation":["Mentor Graphics Corporation, San Jose, CA, USA"],"lastName":"Hong Zhang","id":"37900181400"},{"name":"Tsung-Hao Chen","affiliation":["Mentor Graphics Corporation, San Jose, CA, USA"],"lastName":"Tsung-Hao Chen","id":"37535114100"},{"name":"Ming-Yuan Ting","affiliation":["Mentor Graphics Corporation, San Jose, CA, USA"],"lastName":"Ming-Yuan Ting","id":"37545263200"},{"name":"Xin Li","affiliation":["Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Xin","lastName":"Li","id":"37280872800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-6055-8497-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0738-100X"}],"articleNumber":"5227114","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":12,"citationCountPatent":3,"totalDownloads":341},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5227114","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Robustness","Graphics","Quadratic programming","Lagrangian functions","Integrated circuit modeling","Response surface methodology","Permission","Statistical analysis","Integrated circuit synthesis","Debugging"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS integrated circuits","convex programming","failure analysis","fault diagnosis","integrated circuit design","nanoelectronics","quadratic programming","statistical analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["design-specific worst-case corner extraction","integrated circuit design","statistical analysis","nanoscale integrated circuit design","design-specific worst-case corners","circuit debugging diagnosis","circuit failure diagnosis","quadratically constrained quadratic programming problem","corner extraction","Lagrange duality theory","nonconvex QCQP problem","convex semidefinite programming","CMOS process"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Process Variation","Worst-Case Corner","Integrated Circuit"]}],"abstract":"While statistical analysis has been considered as an important tool for nanoscale integrated circuit design, many IC designers would like to know the design-specific worst-case corners for circuit debugging and failure diagnosis. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm to efficiently extract the worst-case corners for nanoscale ICs. Our proposed approach mathematically formulates a quadratically constrained quadratic programming (QCQP) problem for corner extraction. Next, it applies the Lagrange duality theory to convert the non-convex QCQP problem to a convex semi-definite programming (SDP) problem that is easier to solve. Our circuit example designed in a commercial CMOS process demonstrates that the proposed SDP formulation can find the worst-case corners both efficiently and robustly, while the traditional QCQP fails to achieve global convergence.","doi":"10.1145/1629911.1630013","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1145/1629911.1630013","publicationTitle":"2009 46th ACM/IEEE Design Automation Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 46th ACM/IEEE Design Automation Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5209519/5227020/05227114.pdf","startPage":"386","endPage":"389","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5227020","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient design-specific worst-case corner extraction for integrated circuits","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5227114/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-31 July 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Efficient design-specific worst-case corner extraction for integrated circuits","conferenceDate":"26-31 July 2009","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"28 August 2009","publicationDate":"July 2009","accessionNumber":"10844501","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5227114/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient design-specific worst-case corner extraction for integrated circuits","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"079.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05258S","chronDate":"26-31 July 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5209519","isNumber":"5227020","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5209519","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"5227020","articleId":"5227114","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ACM","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5227120,"authors":[{"name":"Xin Li","affiliation":["ECE Department, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Xin","lastName":"Li","id":"37280872800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-6055-8497-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0738-100X"}],"articleNumber":"5227120","dbTime":"14 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":217},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Equations","Large-scale systems","Integrated circuit modeling","Sampling methods","Circuit simulation","Predictive models","Response surface methodology","Delay","Random variables","Semiconductor device modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["integrated circuits","large scale integration","least squares approximations","nonlinear equations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["large-scale performance modeling","least angle regression","IC technology","strongly nonlinear performance variability","high dimensional performance variability","L1 norm regularization method","least squares fitting"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Process Variation","Response Surface Modeling"]}],"abstract":"The aggressive scaling of IC technology results in high dimensional, strongly nonlinear performance variability that cannot be efficiently captured by traditional modeling techniques.

Namely, although numerous basis functions are needed to span the high dimensional, strongly nonlinear variation space, only a few of them play an important role for a given performance of interest. An efficient algorithm of least angle regression (LAR) is applied to automatically select these important basis functions based on a limited number of simulation samples. Several circuit examples designed in a commercial 65 nm process demonstrate that LAR achieves up to 25times speedup compared with the traditional least squares fitting.","publicationTitle":"2009 46th ACM/IEEE Design Automation Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 46th ACM/IEEE Design Automation Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5209519/5227020/05227120.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5227020","startPage":"364","endPage":"369","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Finding deterministic solution from underdetermined equation: Large-scale performance modeling by least angle regression","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5227120","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Finding deterministic solution from underdetermined equation: Large-scale performance modeling by least angle regression","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-31 July 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5227120/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"26-31 July 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2009","accessionNumber":"10844507","dateOfInsertion":"28 August 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5227120/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Finding deterministic solution from underdetermined equation: Large-scale performance modeling by least angle regression","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"075.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058096S","chronDate":"26-31 July 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5209519","isNumber":"5227020","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5209519","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5227020","articleId":"5227120","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ACM","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5227129,"authors":[{"name":"Tan Yan","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, USA"],"lastName":"Tan Yan","id":"37410567600"},{"name":"Martin D.

Network flow is pervasively used to model this problem. However, none of the previous works correctly models the diagonal capacity, which is essential for 45deg routing in most packages and PCBs. As a result, existing algorithms may either produce routing solutions that violate the diagonal capacity or fail to output a legal routing even though there exists one. In this paper, we propose a new network flow model that guarantees the correctness when diagonal capacity is taken into consideration. This model leads to the first optimal algorithm for escape routing.

We also provide a CNFET technology outlook which includes a survey of challenges as well as existing and potential solutions to these challenges.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 46th ACM/IEEE Design Automation Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5209519/5227020/05227139.pdf","startPage":"304","endPage":"309","publicationTitle":"2009 46th ACM/IEEE Design Automation Conference","doi":"10.1145/1629911.1629995","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1145/1629911.1629995","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5227020","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5227139","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Digital VLSI logic technology using Carbon Nanotube FETs: Frequently Asked Questions","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Very large scale integration","Logic","Circuits","CMOS technology","Silicon","Inverters","Carbon nanotubes","Lithography","Contacts","CNTFETs"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["carbon nanotubes","CMOS integrated circuits","field effect transistors","VLSI"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["digital VLSI logic technology","carbon nanotube FET","carbon nanotube field-effect transistors","silicon-CMOS","energy-delay-product benefits"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Carbon Nanotubes","Carbon Nanotube Transistor","CNFET"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5227139/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-31 July 2009","displayDocTitle":"Digital VLSI logic technology using Carbon Nanotube FETs: Frequently Asked Questions","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5227139/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2009","accessionNumber":"10844526","dateOfInsertion":"28 August 2009","conferenceDate":"26-31 July 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Digital VLSI logic technology using Carbon Nanotube FETs: Frequently Asked Questions","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"064.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.114696S","chronDate":"26-31 July 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5209519","isNumber":"5227020","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5209519","citationCount":"24","xplore-issue":"5227020","articleId":"5227139","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ACM","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5227151,"authors":[{"name":"Robert Wille","affiliation":["Institute of Computer Science, University of Brethemen, Bremen, Germany"],"firstName":"Robert","lastName":"Wille","id":"37308070900"},{"name":"Rolf Drechsler","affiliation":["Institute of Computer Science, University of Brethemen, Bremen, Germany"],"firstName":"Rolf","lastName":"Drechsler","id":"37276502700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-6055-8497-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0738-100X"}],"articleNumber":"5227151","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":118,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":660},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5227151","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Data structures","Boolean functions","Circuit synthesis","Binary decision diagrams","Quantum computing","DNA computing","Optical computing","Logic design","Optical design","Runtime"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["binary decision diagrams","logic circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["BDD-based synthesis","reversible logic","quantum computing","optical computing","DNA computing","binary decision diagram"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Reversible Logic","Quantum Logic","Synthesis","Decision Diagrams"]}],"doi":"10.1145/1629911.1629984","endPage":"275","startPage":"270","publicationTitle":"2009 46th ACM/IEEE Design Automation Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 46th ACM/IEEE Design Automation Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5209519/5227020/05227151.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1145/1629911.1629984","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5227020","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"BDD-based synthesis of reversible logic for large functions","abstract":"Reversible logic is the basis for several emerging technologies such as quantum computing, optical computing, or DNA computing and has further applications in domains like low-power design and nanotechnologies. However, current methods for the synthesis of reversible logic are limited, i.e. they are applicable to relatively small functions only. In this paper, we propose a synthesis approach, that can cope with Boolean functions containing more than a hundred of variables. We present a technique to derive reversible circuits for a function given by a binary decision diagram (BDD). The circuit is obtained using an algorithm with linear worst case behavior regarding run-time and space requirements. Furthermore, the size of the resulting circuit is bounded by the BDD size. This allows to transfer theoretical results known from BDDs to reversible circuits. Experiments show better results (with respect to the circuit cost) and a significantly better scalability in comparison to previous synthesis approaches.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"26-31 July 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5227151/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5227151/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10844538","conferenceDate":"26-31 July 2009","publicationDate":"July 2009","dateOfInsertion":"28 August 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"BDD-based synthesis of reversible logic for large functions","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"BDD-based synthesis of reversible logic for large functions","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"056.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.088727S","chronDate":"26-31 July 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5209519","isNumber":"5227020","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5209519","citationCount":"118","xplore-issue":"5227020","articleId":"5227151","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ACM","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5227152,"authors":[{"name":"Jian Chen","affiliation":["ECE Department, University of Texas, Austin, Austin, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Jian","lastName":"Chen","id":"37406668000"},{"name":"Lizy K.

CMOS technology trends are causing increased process variations which impact the data-dependent power of deep submicron cryptosystem designs. In this paper, we use Monte Carlo methods in SPICE circuit simulations to analyze the statistical properties of the data-dependent power with predictive 45 nm CMOS device and ITRS process variation models. In addition to the \"measurement to disclosure\" (MTD) used, we define a lower level metric, power-attack tolerance (PAT), to model both dynamic power and leakage power data-dependence. We show that the PAT of a typical cryptographic component implementation using CMOS standard-cells can significantly deteriorate due to process variations, thus increasing the component's vulnerability to power attacks. Power-attack-resistant logic styles (e.g. SABL) have been developed which increase PAT by an order of magnitude by balancing power consumption at the gate level with considerable overhead. However in the presence of process variations, the degradation probability of MTD is 57%. To mitigate this problem, we demonstrate a transistor sizing optimization method that can reduce such negative impacts to only 18% with minimal power and area overhead.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Signal Processing and

In conventional design practice, the nMOS transistor within each memory cell is sized to be large enough to carry a current larger than the worst-case MTJ write current threshold, leading to an increasing storage density penalty as the technology scales down. To mitigate such variability-induced storage density penalty, this paper presents a smaller-than-worst-case transistor sizing approach with the underlying theme of jointly considering memory cell transistor sizing and defect tolerance. Its effectiveness is demonstrated using 256 Mb STT MRAM design at 45 nm node as a test vehicle.

Process variations cause large fluctuations in performance and power consumption in the manufactured chips. In addition, these fluctuations cause reductions in the chip yields. In this work, we present an analysis of a representative high-performance processor architecture and show that the caches have the highest probability of causing yield losses under process variations. We then propose a novel selective wordline voltage boosting mechanism that aims at reducing the latency of the cache lines that are affected by process variations. We show that our approach can eliminate over 80% of the yield losses under medium level of variations, while incurring less than 1% per-access energy overhead on average and less than 4.5% area overhead.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Selective wordline voltage boosting for caches to manage yield under process variations","publicationTitle":"2009 46th ACM/IEEE Design Automation Conference","doi":"10.1145/1629911.1629929","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 46th ACM/IEEE Design Automation Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5209519/5227020/05227200.pdf","startPage":"57","endPage":"62","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1145/1629911.1629929","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5227020","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5227200","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5227200/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-31 July 2009","displayDocTitle":"Selective wordline voltage boosting for caches to manage yield under process variations","conferenceDate":"26-31 July 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5227200/","dateOfInsertion":"28 August 2009","publicationDate":"July 2009","accessionNumber":"10844587","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Selective wordline voltage boosting for caches to manage yield under process variations","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"013.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.097669S","chronDate":"26-31 July 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5209519","isNumber":"5227020","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5209519","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"5227020","articleId":"5227200","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ACM","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5227203,"authors":[{"name":"Thorlindur Thorolfsson","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, North Carolina State University, Raleigh, NC, USA"],"firstName":"Thorlindur","lastName":"Thorolfsson","id":"37391652000"},{"name":"Kiran Gonsalves","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, North Carolina State University, Raleigh, NC, USA"],"firstName":"Kiran","lastName":"Gonsalves","id":"37887306400"},{"name":"Paul D.

Still the load on the processor is not less in generic system. This load is reduced by supplementing the main processor with co-processors, which are designed to work upon specific type of functions like numeric computation, signal processing, graphics etc. The speed of ALU depends greatly on the multiplier. In algorithmic and structural levels, numerous multiplication techniques have been developed to enhance the efficiency of the multiplier which concentrates in reducing the partial products and the methods of their addition but the principle behind multiplication remains the same in all cases. Vedic Mathematics is the ancient system of mathematics which has a unique technique of calculations based on 16 Sutras. Employing these techniques in the computation algorithms of the coprocessor will reduce the complexity, execution time, area, power etc. Though there are many sutras employed to handle different sets of numeric, exploring each one gives new results. Our work has proved the efficiency of Urdhva Triyagbhyam-Vedic method for multiplication which strikes a difference in the actual process of multiplication itself. It enables parallel generation of intermedUrdhvaiate products, eliminates unwanted multiplication steps with zeros and scaled to higher bit levels using Karatsuba algorithm with processors,the compatibility to different data types.

This paper is concerned with low cost hardware implementation of CFO sub-system on field programmable gate array (FPGA) which fits in WiMAX system specifications. CFO algorithm and its basic building blocks description have been introduced. For FPGA implementation, an optimized CORDIC module has been used for estimation/correction steps. The design has been prototyped on an XC3S200A device in Spartan-3A Platform using ISE 10.1 all in one design suit from Xilinx. Synthesis results, floorplan mapping and testbench waveforms have been reported. Developing and validating the algorithm in VHDL and simulation phases have been explained. WiMAX transmitter/receiver system and CFO sub-system have been modeled and simulated in MATLAB/SIMULINK tools.

The proposed study leans on mode stirred reverberation chamber (MSRC) of the EMC team, LASMEA (LAboratoire des Sciences et Mateacuteriaux pour l'Eacutelectronique et d'Automatique, Clermont University), France. Based upon the equivalence between backward propagation and reversibility of the wave equation, many TR experiments were led successfully in acoustics. In this paper, an original way of using TR in electromagnetics is detailed (principally concerning the ability of the technique to focus a signal in time and space). First, the theoretical principles of TR are described and illustrated using finite difference in time domain (FDTD) computing of Maxwell's equations. Then, the aim is to accurately describe the influence of various parameters (from FDTD numerical experiments) above focusing. Thus, particular interests rely on the numbers and locations of TR sensors, directivity of source, presence of scatterers, impact of MSRC. Finally, considering characteristics of EMC applications in MSRC, a closer look will be set to the advantages of TR numerical tools for innovating studies in reverberation chambers.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Advances in Computational Tools for Engineering Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5210688/5227822/05227872.pdf","startPage":"157","endPage":"162","publicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Advances in Computational Tools for Engineering Applications","doi":"10.1109/ACTEA.2009.5227872","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACTEA.2009.5227872","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5227822","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5227872","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Electromagnetic Time-Reversal for reverberation chamber applications using FDTD","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Reverberation chamber","Finite difference methods","Time domain analysis","Electromagnetic compatibility","Electromagnetic propagation","Acoustic propagation","Partial differential equations","Acoustic waves","Maxwell equations","Sensor phenomena and characterization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational electromagnetics","electromagnetic compatibility","electromagnetic wave propagation","finite difference time-domain analysis","Maxwell equations","reverberation chambers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electromagnetic time reversal","reverberation chamber","FDTD","electromagnetic compatibility","EMC","backward propagation","wave equation reversibility","finite difference time domain","Maxwell equations"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5227872/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-17 July 2009","displayDocTitle":"Electromagnetic Time-Reversal for reverberation chamber applications using FDTD","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5227872/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2009","accessionNumber":"10861897","dateOfInsertion":"01 September 2009","conferenceDate":"15-17 July 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Electromagnetic Time-Reversal for reverberation chamber applications using FDTD","confLoc":"Beirut, Lebanon","sourcePdf":"1569202688.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059074S","chronDate":"15-17 July 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5210688","isNumber":"5227822","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5210688","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"5227822","articleId":"5227872","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5227881,"authors":[{"name":"A.

We use two levels of the fuzzy fusion to derive the global membership function. The performance of the proposed acquisition scheme is analyzed in frequency-selective Rayleigh fading channels.

The first is done using one branch amplifier with variable load impedance and the second using LINC amplifier with Chireix combiner without stubs. Indeed, in the experimental work, an advanced load pull implementation tools is used where a computer controlled tuner is connected at the amplifier output in order to produce the desired load impedance. Also, a series power meter, network analyzer and RF sources were used to accomplish these measurements. The output power and the efficiency obtained from both measurements are compared and very good agreement between them is shown.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Performance evaluation","Testing","Impedance","Radiofrequency amplifiers","Power measurement","Reflection","Tuners","Radio frequency","Power generation","Power amplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power amplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Chireix PA performances","branch variable load amplifier","Chireix combiner","LINC amplifier","series power meter","network analyzer","RF sources"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ACTEA.2009.5227924","publicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Advances in Computational Tools for Engineering Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Advances in Computational Tools for Engineering Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5210688/5227822/05227924.pdf","startPage":"279","endPage":"283","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5227822","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACTEA.2009.5227924","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Investigation of Chireix PA performances by testing one branch variable load amplifier","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5227924","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Investigation of Chireix PA performances by testing one branch variable load amplifier","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5227924/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5227924/","accessionNumber":"10861949","conferenceDate":"15-17 July 2009","dateOfInsertion":"01 September 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-17 July 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Investigation of Chireix PA performances by testing one branch variable load amplifier","confLoc":"Beirut, Lebanon","sourcePdf":"1569193896.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.038504S","chronDate":"15-17 July 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5210688","isNumber":"5227822","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5210688","xplore-issue":"5227822","articleId":"5227924","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5227932,"authors":[{"name":"Chehla Alioua","affiliation":["D\u00e9partement d\u00e9lectronique, Facult\u00e9 des Sciences de ling\u00e9nieur, Universit\u00e9 Mentouri Constantine, Constantine, Algeria"],"firstName":"Chehla","lastName":"Alioua","id":"37300406100"},{"name":"Faouzi Soltani","affiliation":["Laboratoire Signaux et Syst\u00e9mes de ommunication, D\u00e9partement d\u00e9lectronique, Facult\u00e9 des Sciences de ling\u00e9nieur, Universit\u00e9 Mentouri Constantine, Constantine, Algeria"],"firstName":"Faouzi","lastName":"Soltani","id":"37270432900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3833-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3834-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5227932","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":54},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5227932","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fuzzy neural networks","Parameter estimation","Neurons","Fuzzy sets","Fuzzy logic","Artificial neural networks","Clutter","Radar","Signal detection","Shape"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["backpropagation","fuzzy neural nets","radar computing","radar detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fuzzy neural networks","parameter estimation","K-distribution","artificial neural network","radar signal detection","backpropagation algorithm","training process"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ACTEA.2009.5227932","pdfPath":"/iel5/5210688/5227822/05227932.pdf","publicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Advances in Computational Tools for Engineering Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Advances in Computational Tools for Engineering Applications","startPage":"192","endPage":"196","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5227822","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACTEA.2009.5227932","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The use of fuzzy neural networks for estimating the parameters of the K-distribution","abstract":"Recently, artificial neural network have been used in radar signal detection.

We provide an in-depth description of the concept exploiting analog computing based on the CNN paradigm to solve nonlinear and highly stiff ordinary differential equations (ODEs) and partial differential equations (PDEs). We appply our method to the analysis of the dynamics of two systems modeled by complex and stiff equations. The first system consists of three coupled R\u00f6ssler oscillators in a Master-Slave-Auxiliary configuration. The capabilities of this coupled system to exhibit regular and chaotic dynamics have been demonstrated so far. The synchronization modes of the coupled system can be exploited in chaotic secure communications. The second system is the Burgers' equation which is a well-known classical model for analyzing macroscopic traffic flow motions/ scenarios. As a proof of concept of the proposed approach, the results obtained in this paper are compared with the results available in the relevant literature (benchmarking) and, the proposed concept is validated by a very good agreement obtained. The computation based CNNs paradigm is advantageous as it provides accurate and ultra-fast solutions of very complex ODEs and PDEs and performs real-time computing.","doi":"10.1109/INDS.2009.5227975","startPage":"213","endPage":"220","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 2nd International Workshop on Nonlinear Dynamics and Synchronization","pdfPath":"/iel5/5210645/5227959/05227975.pdf","publicationTitle":"2009 2nd International Workshop on Nonlinear Dynamics and Synchronization","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INDS.2009.5227975","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5227959","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Solving stiff ordinary differential equations and partial differential equations using analog computing based on cellular neural networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Differential equations","Partial differential equations","Analog computers","Computer networks","Cellular neural networks","Chaotic communication","Cellular networks","Signal processing","Computational modeling","Computer simulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["analogue computers","cellular neural nets","partial differential equations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["stiff ordinary differential equations","partial differential equations","analog computing","cellular neural networks","coupled Roumlssler oscillators","Master-Slave-Auxiliary configuration","chaotic secure communications","Burgers equation","macroscopic traffic flow motions"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["ODE","PDE","Cellular neural network","templates calculations","dicretization","coupling","stiffness"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5227975/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-21 July 2009","displayDocTitle":"Solving stiff ordinary differential equations and partial differential equations using analog computing based on cellular neural networks","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5227975/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2009","dateOfInsertion":"01 September 2009","conferenceDate":"20-21 July 2009","accessionNumber":"10861827","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Solving stiff ordinary differential equations and partial differential equations using analog computing based on cellular neural networks","confLoc":"Klagenfurt, Austria","sourcePdf":"Ched2.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049009S","chronDate":"20-21 July 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5210645","isNumber":"5227959","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5210645","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5227959","articleId":"5227975","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":5227982,"authors":[{"name":"Fereidoun A.

Load data is collected from remote locations through remote terminal units (RTU) over a communication channel that introduces noise which be Gaussian or non-Gaussian in nature.

This paper compares them in topological structures, initializing ways, learning methods, et al. Based on the comparison and combined with pattern recognition technology, this paper proposes a novel adaptive intrusion detection approach using idiotypic networks. Additionally, the approach is compared with detection approach using neural networks. Idiotypic networks' memory and learning abilities, especially their dynamic adjustable ability enable them superior to neural networks in the application for intrusion detection. This paper presents a new detection algorithm according to immune response principles and a new multimutation pattern idiotypic network model to implement the detection algorithm. By utilizing some immune principles, the proposed approach can overcome problems existing in detection approaches based on neural networks. Firstly, idiotypic networks can adjust automatically with presenting of antigens, making new features fused into networks continuously. Thus, this approach needs not to be updated periodically. Secondly, the trained network model can still be changed to learn new features of attacks, so the performance of detecting unknown attacks is improved. Thirdly, clone expansion of antibodies is suppressed by idiotypic effects, thus false positive rate is decreased. Experiments are carried out on Fisher Iris dataset and KDD-CUP-99 database to verify the performance of this adaptive detection approach. Compared with the detection approach based on a multilayer perception network, the false positive rate is decreased and the detection accuracy of unknown attacks is increased.","doi":"10.1109/INDS.2009.5228006","startPage":"203","endPage":"208","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 2nd International Workshop on Nonlinear Dynamics and Synchronization","pdfPath":"/iel5/5210645/5227959/05228006.pdf","publicationTitle":"2009 2nd International Workshop on Nonlinear Dynamics and Synchronization","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INDS.2009.5228006","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5227959","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A novel adaptive intrusion detection approach based on comparison of neural networks and idiotypic networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Intrusion detection","Neural networks","Multi-layer neural network","Learning systems","Pattern recognition","Detection algorithms","Iris","Computer networks","Detectors","Mechatronics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multilayer perceptrons","security of data"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive intrusion detection approach","neural networks","idiotypic networks","topological structures","initializing ways","learning methods","pattern recognition technology","antigens","Fisher Iris dataset","KDD-CUP-99 database","adaptive detection approach","multilayer perception network"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["pattern recognition","neural networks","idiotypic networks","intrusion detection"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5228006/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-21 July 2009","displayDocTitle":"A novel adaptive intrusion detection approach based on comparison of neural networks and idiotypic networks","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5228006/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2009","dateOfInsertion":"01 September 2009","conferenceDate":"20-21 July 2009","accessionNumber":"10861858","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A novel adaptive intrusion detection approach based on comparison of neural networks and idiotypic networks","confLoc":"Klagenfurt, Austria","sourcePdf":"1569198583.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06145S","chronDate":"20-21 July 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5210645","isNumber":"5227959","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5210645","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"5227959","articleId":"5228006","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5228016,"authors":[{"name":"Latha Parthiban","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Aarupadai Veedu Institute of Technology, Chennai, India"],"bio":{"p":["Latha Parthiban was born in Chennai, India, in 1973.

The proposed CANFIS model combined the neural network adaptive capabilities and the fuzzy logic qualitative approach which is then integrated with genetic algorithm.

It can overcome the shortcoming of the structural expansion caused by larger number of inputs in traditional adaptive fuzzy neural networks (TAFNN) taking all states as its inputs. The results of its applications to electro-hydraulic position tracking system (EHPTS) show that it has an advantage over the TAFNN controller (TAFNNC) in steady characteristics of system.

The unscented particle filter uses the unscented Kalman Filter to generate particles in the particle filtering framework. This method can give better performance than the standard particle filter in some practical problems that are raised in computer vision field. But one critical issue in the unscented particle filter is that it has very high computational complexity which constrains its broader application. In this paper, we give an improvement strategy aiming at reducing the computational complexity of the algorithm. This strategy combines the general framework of particle filtering with the transition prior and the unscented Kalman filter, taking advantage of the low computational complexity of the standard particle filter and the high estimation accuracy of the unscented particle filter. The experimental results show that this strategy can reduce the running time cost of the unscented particle filter greatly without loss of accuracy.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5228418/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-28 July 2009","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"25-28 July 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5228418/","dateOfInsertion":"01 September 2009","publicationDate":"July 2009","accessionNumber":"10860476","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Improving particle filter with a new sampling strategy","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improving particle filter with a new sampling strategy","confLoc":"Nanning, China","sourcePdf":"P0408-412.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.039957S","chronDate":"25-28 July 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5209213","isNumber":"5228118","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5209213","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"5228118","articleId":"5228418","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":5228423,"authors":[{"name":"Ming Yang","affiliation":["School of Computer, Electronics and Information, Guangxi University, Nanning, China"],"firstName":"Ming","lastName":"Yang","id":"37654230100"},{"name":"Taoshen Li","affiliation":["School of Computer, Electronics and Information, Guangxi University, Nanning, China"],"firstName":"Taoshen","lastName":"Li","id":"37280718900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3520-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3521-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5228423","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":93},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Routing","Particle swarm optimization","Iterative algorithms","Network servers","Computer science","Computer science education","Computer networks","NP-complete problem","Intelligent networks","Constraint optimization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["IP networks","particle swarm optimisation","quality of service","telecommunication network routing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["RDO-PSO algorithm","anycast routing","multiQoS constraints","IPv6","NP-complete problem","random disturbance operator","particle swam optimisation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Anycast","QoS routing","Particle swam optimization","special add operator","Random disturbance operator"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5228423","abstract":"Anycast is a new network service that is proposed in IPv6, and it can balance the load of network effectively.

Secondly, by using the pruning technology, significant nodes can be self-adaptive according to their contributions to the system performance. Consequently, the proposed method can achieve high performance with a parsimonious structure.

Although the multilevel circuit has more component count than the two-level circuit it is more suitable for high voltage applications. The restorer is bypassed under normal operating conditions and is connected to the load depending upon voltage sag detection. The switches of the inverter are controlled by PWM signals. In the paper the operation of the multilevel circuit is simulated in SABER to study the operating capability of the multilevel inverter. A comparative study between the traditional two-level circuit and the proposed multilevel circuit is provided to highlight the performance of the multilevel circuit.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5228610/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-22 May 2009","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"20-22 May 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5228610/","dateOfInsertion":"01 September 2009","publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10860736","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A novel single-phase voltage sag restorer with diode-clamped multilevel bridge","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A novel single-phase voltage sag restorer with diode-clamped multilevel bridge","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"090.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073338S","chronDate":"20-22 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5210381","isNumber":"5228578","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5210381","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5228578","articleId":"5228610","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Hong Kong Polytechnic University","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":5228635,"authors":[{"name":"Yanxia Gao","affiliation":["School of Mechanical & Electronic Engineering and Automation, Shanghai University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Yanxia","lastName":"Gao","id":"37404896100"},{"name":"Shuibao Guo","affiliation":["Laboratory AMPERE (CNRS UMR 5005), INSA Lyon, Villeurbanne, France","School of Mechanical & Electronic Engineering and Automation, Shanghai University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Shuibao","lastName":"Guo","id":"37400159200"},{"name":"Yanping Xu","affiliation":["School of Mechanical & Electronic Engineering and Automation, Shanghai University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Yanping","lastName":"Xu","id":"37577062800"},{"name":"Shi Xuefang Lin","affiliation":["Laboratory AMPERE (CNRS UMR 5005), INSA Lyon, Villeurbanne, France"],"firstName":"Shi Xuefang","lastName":"Lin","id":"37894917600"},{"name":"Bruno Allard","affiliation":["Laboratory AMPERE (CNRS UMR 5005), INSA Lyon, Villeurbanne, France"],"firstName":"Bruno","lastName":"Allard","id":"37276416300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3845-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5228635","dbTime":"19 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":884},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Digital control","Switched-mode power supply","Pulsed power supplies","Clocks","Switching frequency","Space vector pulse width modulation","Digital modulation","Pulse modulation","Field programmable gate arrays","Prototypes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["DC-DC power convertors","digital control","field programmable gate arrays","PWM power convertors","switched mode power supplies"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FPGA-based DPWM","digital pulse-width modulator","digital controller application","high-frequency DC-DC SMPS","high-frequency switching mode power supply","digital clock manager","counter-comparator","high-frequency buck converter","power consumption"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["DPWM","DCM phase-shift","digital dither","SMPS","FPGA implementation"]}],"abstract":"Digital pulse-width modulator (DPWM) is known as the critical module in digital controller application for high-frequency switching mode power supply (SMPS).

A semidefinite programming framework allows us to impose various quality-of-service (QoS) constraints for each source-destination pair. The proposed scheme outperforms a cooperative relaying strategy that is based on a minimum mean square error (MMSE). The design also considers quantization of signals that are passed between cooperating relays.

The accelerator is meant to address the MIMO decoding bottlenecks associated with the convergence of multiple high-speed wireless standards onto a single device. It is scalable in the number of antennas, bandwidth, modulation format, and most importantly, present and emerging decoder algorithms. It features a Harvard-like architecture with complex vector operands and a deeply pipelined fixed-point complex arithmetic processing unit. When implemented on a Xilinx Virtex-4 LX200FF1513 field-programmable gate array (FPGA), the design occupied 43% of overall FPGA resources. The accelerator shows an advantage of up to three orders of magnitude (1000 times) in power-delay product for typical MIMO decoding operations relative to a general purpose DSP. When compared to dedicated application-specific IC (ASIC) implementations of mmse MIMO decoders, the accelerator showed a degradation of 340%-17%, depending on the actual ASIC being considered. In order to optimize the design for both speed and area, specific challenges had to be overcome.

To reduce the energy consumption of the LDPC decoder, memory-bypassing scheme has been proposed for the layered decoding architecture which reduces the amount of access to the memory storing the soft posterior reliability values. In this work, we present a scheme that achieves the optimal reduction of memory access for the memory bypassing scheme. The amount of achievable memory bypassing depends on the decoding order of the layers. We formulate the problem of finding the optimal decoding order and propose algorithm to obtain the optimal solution. We also present the corresponding architecture which combines some of memory components and results in reduction of memory area. The proposed decoder was implemented in TSMC 0.18 \u03bcm CMOS process. Experimental results show that for a LDPC decoder targeting IEEE 802.11 n specification, the amount of memory access values can be reduced by 12.9-19.3% compared with the state-of-the-art design. At the same time, 95.6%-100% hardware utilization rate is achieved.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5229117/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 September 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2010","volume":"18","issue":"8","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11433032","dateOfInsertion":"23 July 2010","publicationDate":"Aug. 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5229117/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"An Energy Efficient Layered Decoding Architecture for LDPC Decoder","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Energy Efficient Layered Decoding Architecture for LDPC Decoder","sourcePdf":"tvlsi-jjin-2021479-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.117631S","chronDate":"Aug.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"92","isNumber":"5518454","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"5518454","articleId":"5229117","onlineDate":"01 September 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-23"},{"_id":5229123,"authors":[{"name":"Mohammad M.

In this paper, we propose a fully distributed and scalable cooperative spectrum-sensing scheme based on recent advances in consensus algorithms. In the proposed scheme, the secondary users can maintain coordination based on only local information exchange without a centralized common receiver. Unlike most of the existing decision rules, such as the or-rule or the 1-out-of-N rule, we use the consensus of secondary users to make the final decision. Simulation results show that the proposed consensus scheme can have significant lower missing detection probabilities and false alarm probabilities in CR networks. It is also demonstrated that the proposed scheme not only has proven sensitivity in detecting the primary user's presence but also has robustness in choosing a desirable decision threshold.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5229125/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 September 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"59","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"15 January 2010","accessionNumber":"11070322","htmlLink":"/document/5229125/","displayDocTitle":"A Distributed Consensus-Based Cooperative Spectrum-Sensing Scheme in Cognitive Radios","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Distributed Consensus-Based Cooperative Spectrum-Sensing Scheme in Cognitive Radios","sourcePdf":"tvt-yu-2031181.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.203196S","chronDate":"Jan.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"5383378","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"182","xplore-issue":"5383378","articleId":"5229125","onlineDate":"01 September 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5229131,"authors":[{"name":"Md.

Generalized equivalent circuits valid for steady-state and dynamic performance have been proposed for the family of active-clamp converters. The active-clamp converter is analyzed for its dynamic behavior under current control in this paper. The steady-state stability analysis is presented. On account of the lossless damping inherent in the active-clamp converters, it appears that the stability region in the current-controlled active-clamp converters get extended for duty ratios, a little greater than 0.5, unlike in conventional hard-switched converters. The conventional graphical approach fails to assess the stability of current-controlled active-clamp converters due to the coupling between the filter inductor current and resonant inductor current. An analysis that takes into account the presence of the resonant elements is presented to establish the condition for stability. This method correctly predicts the stability of the current-controlled active-clamp converters. A simple expression for the maximum duty cycle for subharmonic free operation is obtained.

Two distributed control laws are proposed and analyzed. The first control law applies a passivity approach for distributed attitude synchronization. The control law guarantees attitude synchronization without the requirement for absolute angular velocity measurements and relative angular velocity measurements between neighboring rigid bodies. The second control law incorporates a time-varying reference attitude, where the reference attitude is allowed to be available to only a subset of the group members under general directed information exchange. The control law guarantees that all rigid bodies track the time-varying reference attitude as long as a virtual leader whose attitude is the time-varying reference attitude has a directed path to all other rigid bodies in the group. Simulation results are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the two control laws.","doi":"10.1109/TCST.2009.2016428","startPage":"383","endPage":"392","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Control Systems Technology","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCST.2009.2016428","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5419295","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Control Systems Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/87/5419295/05229134.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Distributed Cooperative Attitude Synchronization and Tracking for Multiple Rigid Bodies","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5229134/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Distributed Cooperative Attitude Synchronization and Tracking for Multiple Rigid Bodies","volume":"18","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/5229134/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11142501","publicationDate":"March 2010","dateOfInsertion":"22 February 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 September 2009","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distributed Cooperative Attitude Synchronization and Tracking for Multiple Rigid Bodies","sourcePdf":"tcst-wren-2016428.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.100474S","chronDate":"March  2010","xplore-pub-id":"87","isNumber":"5419295","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"87","citationCount":"269","xplore-issue":"5419295","articleId":"5229134","onlineDate":"01 September 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-27"},{"_id":5229135,"authors":[{"name":"N\u00e9stor O.

A common characteristic of minimum-variance controllers, adaptive or not, is that they rely on prediction filters with large high-frequency gains to predict broadband disturbances, and this often produces control-signal saturation and eventual loss of stability. Two methods are introduced here to address this issue. The first method, suitable for online adaptive control, uses frequency weighting to constrain the high-frequency gain of the prediction filter. The second method, suitable for tuning fixed-gain controllers, employs an adaptive scheme iteratively over a finite duration. Both methods were implemented on a commercial hard disk drive, and experimental results demonstrate their effectiveness.","doi":"10.1109/TCST.2009.2018298","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Control Systems Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Control Systems Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/87/5419295/05229135.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCST.2009.2018298","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5419295","startPage":"368","endPage":"382","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Saturation-Induced Instability and Its Avoidance in Adaptive Control of Hard Disk Drives","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5229135","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Saturation-Induced Instability and Its Avoidance in Adaptive Control of Hard Disk Drives","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5229135/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 September 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"18","issue":"2","publicationDate":"March 2010","accessionNumber":"11142509","dateOfInsertion":"22 February 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5229135/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Saturation-Induced Instability and Its Avoidance in Adaptive Control of Hard Disk Drives","sourcePdf":"tcst-perezarancibia-2018298.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.098697S","chronDate":"March  2010","xplore-pub-id":"87","isNumber":"5419295","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"87","citationCount":"77","xplore-issue":"5419295","articleId":"5229135","onlineDate":"01 September 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5229136,"authors":[{"name":"Wei Ren","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, Utah State University, Logan, UT, USA"],"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Ren","id":"37271980400"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6536"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-0865"},{"format":"CD","value":"2374-0159"}],"articleNumber":"5229136","dbTime":"18 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":161,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1450},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Control Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieeecss.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Topology","Algorithm design and analysis","Control systems","Trajectory","Vehicle dynamics","Convergence","Interferometers","Surveillance","Reconnaissance","Hazardous materials"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mobile robots","multi-robot systems","time-varying systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["consensus tracking problems","bounded control effort","directed switching interaction topologies","time-varying consensus reference state","directed fixed interaction topology","directed switching intervehicle interaction topologies","multirobot platform","formation control application"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Consensus","cooperative control","formation control","multi-vehicle systems"]}],"abstract":"Consensus tracking problems with, respectively, bounded control effort and directed switching interaction topologies are considered when a time-varying consensus reference state is available to only a subgroup of a team and the team members have only local interaction.

Under the assumptions of perfect channel estimation and no interference, the closed-form expression of average RIR is derived, involving various parameters, such as the number of antennas, correlation, reader structure, and Nakagami- m shaping factor. The results show that the employment of multiple antennas at a reader causes the received SNR to change favorably and contributes to the improvement of the average RIR. Particularly, for the bistatic structure and Rayleigh fading (m = 0 dB), a 3 \u00d7 3 MIMO-RFID system can achieve 60% gain in the average RIR compared to the SISO-RFID system. In order to consider more realistic environments, finally, we investigated the influence of interference and imperfect channel estimation on the average RIR of the MIMO-RFID system in the uncorrelated Rayleigh fading channel.","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2009.2030134","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/41/5427230/05229149.pdf","startPage":"1468","endPage":"1477","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2009.2030134","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5427230","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reverse-Link Interrogation Range of a UHF MIMO-RFID System in Nakagami- - Fading Channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5229149","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 September 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5229149/","displayDocTitle":"Reverse-Link Interrogation Range of a UHF MIMO-RFID System in Nakagami- <formula formulatype=\"inline\"><tex Notation=\"TeX\">$m$</tex></formula> Fading Channels","volume":"57","issue":"4","publicationDate":"April 2010","accessionNumber":"11168806","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5229149/","dateOfInsertion":"08 March 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reverse-Link Interrogation Range of a UHF MIMO-RFID System in Nakagami- <formula formulatype=\"inline\"><tex Notation=\"TeX\">$m$</tex></formula> Fading Channels","sourcePdf":"tie-kim-2030134.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.130706S","chronDate":"April  2010","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"5427230","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"41","xplore-issue":"5427230","articleId":"5229149","onlineDate":"01 September 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5229153,"authors":[{"name":"Youhei Hinago","affiliation":["Tokyo University of Science, Tokyo, Japan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/5508599/5229153/5229153-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Youhei Hinago (S'09) received the B.S. degree (with honors) in electrical engineering from Tokyo University of Science, Tokyo, Japan, in 2009, where he is currently working toward the M.S. degree.","His research deals with the study of multilevel inverters for electric vehicles.","Mr. Hinago was the recipient of the Kodama Memorial Science Award from the Foundation for Advancement of Science and Technology and the IEEJ Student Award from The Institute of Electrical Engineers of Japan in 2009."]},"firstName":"Youhei","lastName":"Hinago","id":"37543218900"},{"name":"Hirotaka Koizumi","affiliation":["Tokyo University of Science, Tokyo, Japan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/5508599/5229153/5229153-photo-2-source-small.gif","p":["Hirotaka Koizumi (S'98\u2013M'01) was born in Tokyo, Japan, in 1970.

The strategy adopted consists of a computationally simple two stage scheme where an interpolation stage refines the coarse estimate obtained from an initial maximum bin search. The interpolators of Quinn, and of Aboutanios and Mulgrew, developed for undamped exponentials are extended to the damped case. In the process, we show that Quinn's estimator can be viewed as a linearized version of Bertocco's algorithm. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that the resulting estimators exhibit similar behavior to the undamped case, leading us to propose two alternative hybrid implementations that yield a significant improvement in the estimation performance. Unlike the undamped case, however, we show that there exists a finite number of samples for which the estimation performance is best, and which we determine in terms of the damping factor. This enables us to adjust the actual number of samples should it deviate significantly from the optimum. Extensive simulation results are presented to support the theoretical findings.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5229156/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 September 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"58","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"12 January 2010","accessionNumber":"11054906","htmlLink":"/document/5229156/","displayDocTitle":"Estimation of the Frequency and Decay Factor of a Decaying Exponential in Noise","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Estimation of the Frequency and Decay Factor of a Decaying Exponential in Noise","sourcePdf":"tsp-aboutanios-2031299.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.067847S","chronDate":"Feb.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"5379139","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"31","xplore-issue":"5379139","articleId":"5229156","onlineDate":"01 September 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5229157,"authors":[{"name":"Ioana-Cornelia Vese","affiliation":["Special Electric Machines and Light Electric Traction Group, Technical University of Cluj Napoca, Cluj-Napoca, Romania"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/5352216/5229157/5229157-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Ioana-Cornelia Vese received the Dipl.Ing. degree in electrical engineering from the Technical University of Cluj-Napoca, Cluj-Napoca, Romania, in 2003, where she is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree in the Special Electric Machines and Light Electric Traction Group.","Since 2007, she has been an Assistant Lecturer in the Department of Electric Drives and Robots, Technical University of Cluj-Napoca.

For MIMO radars with STAP, one big concern is the clutter rank. Current studies employ the rule of time-bandwidth product to predict the clutter rank of MIMO radars using orthogonal waveforms. This paper investigates clutter rank estimation for MIMO radar systems with more flexible waveform diversity, where waveforms are not constrained to be orthogonal. Under general waveform assumption, we have derived the clutter covariance matrix as a function of waveform covariance matrix (WCM). The clutter rank is then found to be determined by the rank and structure of the WCM. For different waveform cases, the WCM may be either full rank or rank deficient. Rules for estimation of clutter rank in these cases are provided and demonstrated by numerical simulations.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Clutter Rank of STAP in MIMO Radar With Waveform Diversity","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2009.2031301","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/5379139/05229175.pdf","startPage":"938","endPage":"943","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2009.2031301","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5379139","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5229175","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5229175/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 September 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2010","displayDocTitle":"Clutter Rank of STAP in MIMO Radar With Waveform Diversity","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"58","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/5229175/","dateOfInsertion":"12 January 2010","publicationDate":"Feb. 2010","accessionNumber":"11054894","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Clutter Rank of STAP in MIMO Radar With Waveform Diversity","sourcePdf":"58tsp01-ylu-2031301.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.068937S","chronDate":"Feb.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"5379139","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"33","xplore-issue":"5379139","articleId":"5229175","onlineDate":"01 September 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5229179,"authors":[{"name":"Tung T.

With field-orientated control, the maximum-torque-per-ampere control strategy for unsaturated voltage conditions (below the base speed) is well known; the field-weakening strategy, however, could be rather complicated. In this paper, a straightforward torque control strategy for the entire speed range is proposed and demonstrated. Practical implementation of the method is very simple since the calculations are done offline in an automated process and are therefore removed from the load of the DSP. The process relies on machine-specific data from FE analysis and therefore includes nonlinear effects such as saturation and cross coupling. Simulation and practical results for a permanent-magnet and a reluctance synchronous machine show that the torque is controlled effectively in the entire speed range using this generic method.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2009.2030209","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5352216","startPage":"413","endPage":"419","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/41/5352216/05229183.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal Torque Control of Synchronous Machines Based on Finite-Element Analysis","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5229183/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 September 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5229183/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Optimal Torque Control of Synchronous Machines Based on Finite-Element Analysis","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2010","accessionNumber":"11019842","dateOfInsertion":"11 December 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"57","issue":"1","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal Torque Control of Synchronous Machines Based on Finite-Element Analysis","sourcePdf":"tie-dekock-2030209.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.336764S","chronDate":"Jan.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"5352216","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"40","xplore-issue":"5352216","articleId":"5229183","onlineDate":"01 September 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5229186,"authors":[{"name":"Ayman M.

An example of multiaxial attitude-tracking maneuvers is presented, and simulation results are included to verify and compare the practical usefulness of the various controllers.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/41/5427230/05229194.pdf","startPage":"1436","endPage":"1444","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2009.2030215","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2009.2030215","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5427230","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5229194","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Quasi-Continuous Higher Order Sliding-Mode Controllers for Spacecraft-Attitude-Tracking Maneuvers","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sliding mode control","Space vehicles","Kinematics","Control systems","Angular velocity","Quaternions","Vehicle dynamics","Nonlinear equations","Linear feedback control systems","Smoothing methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["angular velocity control","attitude control","Lyapunov methods","nonlinear control systems","space vehicles","variable structure systems","vehicle dynamics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["higher order sliding mode control","spacecraft control","quasicontinuous sliding mode control","linear sliding manifolds","angular velocity function","quaternion error function","Lyapunov method","multiaxial attitude-tracking maneuvers"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Higher order sliding-mode control (HOSMC)","sliding-mode differentiators","spacecraft control"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5229194/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 September 2009","displayDocTitle":"Quasi-Continuous Higher Order Sliding-Mode Controllers for Spacecraft-Attitude-Tracking Maneuvers","volume":"57","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/5229194/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2010","accessionNumber":"11168804","dateOfInsertion":"08 March 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Quasi-Continuous Higher Order Sliding-Mode Controllers for Spacecraft-Attitude-Tracking Maneuvers","sourcePdf":"tie-pukdeboon-2030215.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.138953S","chronDate":"April  2010","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"5427230","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"120","xplore-issue":"5427230","articleId":"5229194","onlineDate":"01 September 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5229195,"authors":[{"name":"Grant A.

In air-cooled machines, these losses are evacuated by a forced cooling airflow through the active parts. When designing and optimizing such a machine, the design engineer must be able to get a full picture of the power losses, the cooling airflow, and the temperatures inside the active parts (e.g., core laminations, windings) and the periphery (e.g., winding overhangs). The aim of the designer is to fulfill the customer's requirements regarding the guaranteed temperatures. This paper presents a computation method, where the power loss, airflow, and temperature calculations for the world's largest air-cooled hydrogenerators are coupled in an iterative process. The new contribution of this paper is a calculation software developed by the authors. It includes a state-of-the-art loss computation, an automated airflow network, and a set of linked thermal networks. These computations result in a complete overview of the temperature gradients and allow fine tuning of the cooling airflow and, consequently, optimization of ventilation losses.","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2009.2031191","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2009.2031191","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5352216","startPage":"172","endPage":"180","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/41/5352216/05229207.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5229207","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cooling","Temperature","Synchronous machines","Machine windings","Steady-state","Design optimization","Design engineering","Power engineering and energy","Lamination","Iterative methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electric machine analysis computing","synchronous machines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["air-cooled synchronous machines","rotating electrical machine heating","forced cooling airflow","core laminations","winding overhangs","air-cooled hydrogenerators"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cooling","hydroelectric generators","losses","synchronous generators","synchronous machines","temperature"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Cooling Airflow, Losses, and Temperatures in Large Air-Cooled Synchronous Machines","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2010","isJournal":true,"volume":"57","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2010","accessionNumber":"11019848","dateOfInsertion":"11 December 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5229207/","isStaticHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 September 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5229207/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cooling Airflow, Losses, and Temperatures in Large Air-Cooled Synchronous Machines","sourcePdf":"tie-traxlersamek-2031191.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.083181S","chronDate":"Jan.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"5352216","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"110","xplore-issue":"5352216","articleId":"5229207","onlineDate":"01 September 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-25"},{"_id":5229209,"authors":[{"name":"Chaohua Dai","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Southwest Jiaotong University, Chengdu, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/5446457/5229209/5229209-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Chaohua Dai received the Ph.D. degree in electric system control and information technique from Southwest Jiaotong University, Chengdu, China, in 2009.","He is currently an Associate Professor in the School of Electrical Engineering, Southwest Jiaotong University.

The algorithm's performance is studied with comparison of three versions of differential evolution algorithms, four versions of particle swarm optimization algorithms, and genetic algorithm.

Subsampling","abstract":"<para xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> Most consumer digital color cameras are equipped with a single chip. Such cameras capture only one color component per pixel (e.g., Bayer pattern) instead of an RGB triple. Conventionally, missing color components at each pixel are interpolated from its neighboring pixels, so that full color images are constructed. This process is typically referred to as demosaicing. After demosaicing, the full resolution RGB video frames are converted into YUV color space. U and V are then typically subsampled by a factor of four and the resulting video data in the 4:2:0 format become the input for the video encoder. In this letter, we look into the weakness of the conventional scheme and propose a novel solution for compressing Bayer-pattern video data. The novelty of our work lies largely in the chroma subsampling. We properly choose the locations to calculate the chroma pixels U and V according to the positions of B and R pixels in the Bayer pattern and this leads to higher quality of the reconstructed images. In our experiments, we have observed an improvement in composite peak-signal-to-noise ratio performance of up to 1.5 dB at the same encoding rate. Based on this highly efficient approach, we propose also a low-complexity method which saves almost half of the computation at the expense of a small loss in coding efficiency. </para>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5229234/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 September 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5229234/","dateOfInsertion":"04 December 2009","publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","accessionNumber":"11005230","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"19","issue":"12","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Compression of Bayer-Pattern Video Sequences Using Adjusted Chroma Subsampling","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Compression of Bayer-Pattern Video Sequences Using Adjusted Chroma Subsampling","sourcePdf":"tcsvt-hchen-2031370.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.041946S","chronDate":"Dec.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"76","isNumber":"5344167","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"76","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"5344167","articleId":"5229234","onlineDate":"01 September 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":5229243,"authors":[{"name":"Gwo Giun Lee","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/76/5314174/5229243/5229243-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Gwo Giun Lee (S'91\u2013M'97\u2013SM'07) received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering from National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan, and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from the University of Massachusetts.","He has held several technical and managerial positions in the industry; he has held the position of System Architect at Philips Semiconductors, Sunnyvale, CA, and the position of DSP Architect at Micrel Semiconductors, San Jose, CA.

This survey paper addresses the latest research and future perspectives on the simultaneous development of video coding, processing, and computing algorithms with emerging platforms that have multiple cores and reconfigurable architecture. As the algorithms in forthcoming visual systems become increasingly complex, many applications must have different profiles with different levels of performance. Hence, with expectations that the visual experience in the future will become continuously better, it is critical that advanced platforms provide higher performance, better flexibility, and lower power consumption. To achieve these goals, algorithm and architecture co-design is significant for characterizing the algorithmic complexity used to optimize targeted architecture. This paper shows that seamless weaving of the development of previously autonomous visual computing algorithms and multicore or reconfigurable architectures will unavoidably become the leading trend in the future of video technology.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Algorithm/Architecture Co-Exploration of Visual Computing on Emergent Platforms: Overview and Future Prospects","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","doi":"10.1109/TCSVT.2009.2031376","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/76/5314174/05229243.pdf","startPage":"1576","endPage":"1587","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSVT.2009.2031376","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5314174","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5229243","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5229243/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 September 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2009","displayDocTitle":"Algorithm/Architecture Co-Exploration of Visual Computing on Emergent Platforms: Overview and Future Prospects","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"19","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/5229243/","dateOfInsertion":"06 November 2009","publicationDate":"Nov. 2009","accessionNumber":"10959273","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Algorithm/Architecture Co-Exploration of Visual Computing on Emergent Platforms: Overview and Future Prospects","sourcePdf":"tcsvt-glee-2031376.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.145729S","chronDate":"Nov.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"76","isNumber":"5314174","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"76","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"5314174","articleId":"5229243","onlineDate":"01 September 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5229259,"authors":[{"name":"Vinicius Machado","affiliation":["Department of Informatics and Statistics, Federal University of Piau\u00ed, Teresina, Brazil"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/5446457/5229259/5229259-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Vinicius Machado was born in Parnaiba, Brazil, in 1976.

These agents detect faults in automated processes and allocate intelligent algorithms in field device function blocks (FBs) to solve these faults. We also present a dynamic FB parameter exchange strategy that allows agent fieldbus allocation. This architecture is a foundation for intelligent physical agents standard-based agent platform developed using Foundation Fieldbus technology. The aim is to enable problem detection activities, independent of user intervention. The use of artificial neural network (ANN)-based algorithms enables the agents to learn about fault patterns and adapt an algorithm that can be used in fault situations. Thus, we intend to reduce supervisor intervention in selecting and implementing an appropriate structure for FB algorithms. Furthermore, these algorithms, when implemented in device FBs, provide a solution at the fieldbus level, reducing data traffic between gateway and device, and speeding up the process of problem resolution. We also show some examples of our approach. The first is a neural network architecture change that allocates different types of neural networks in field devices without interrupting the fieldbus network operation. The second shows a multiagent architecture that implements the neural network change in a laboratory test process, where fault scenarios have been simulated.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5229259/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 September 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11228979","volume":"57","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/5229259/","publicationDate":"May 2010","dateOfInsertion":"12 April 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A Neural Network Multiagent Architecture Applied to Industrial Networks for Dynamic Allocation of Control Strategies Using Standard Function Blocks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Neural Network Multiagent Architecture Applied to Industrial Networks for Dynamic Allocation of Control Strategies Using Standard Function Blocks","sourcePdf":"tie-machado-2031196.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.102138S","chronDate":"May  2010","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"5446457","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"5446457","articleId":"5229259","onlineDate":"01 September 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":5229285,"authors":[{"name":"Jianqing Wang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Nagoya Institute of Technology, Nagoya, Aichi, Japan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/22/5280557/5229285/5229285-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jianqing Wang (M'99) received the B.E. degree in electronic engineering from the Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China, in 1984, and the M.E. and D.E. degrees in electrical and communication engineering from Tohoku University, Sendai, Japan, in 1988 and 1991, respectively.","He was a Research Associate with Tohoku University and a Senior Engineer with Sophia Systems Company Ltd., prior to joining the Nagoya Institute of Technology, Nagoya, Japan, in 1997, where he is currently a Professor.

For performance improvement, most practical video compression systems adopt a denoising filter as a pre-processing module for the video encoder, or as a post-processing module for the video decoder, but the complexity introduced by denoising can be very high. This paper first presents a recursive temporal linear minimum mean squared error (LMMSE) filter for video denoising. Based on the analysis of the hybrid video compression process, two novel schemes are presented, one for video encoding and the other for video decoding, in which the proposed recursive temporal LMMSE filter is seamlessly integrated into the encoding and the decoding processes, respectively. For both of these two schemes, the denoising is implemented with nearly no extra computation introduced. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of the proposed schemes on encoding and decoding noisy video sequences.","doi":"10.1109/TCSVT.2009.2031453","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","startPage":"236","endPage":"249","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSVT.2009.2031453","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5410067","pdfPath":"/iel5/76/5410067/05229293.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Noise reduction","Video codecs","Video compression","Wiener filter","Decoding","Encoding","Filtering","Gold","Video sequences","Adaptive filters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data compression","filtering theory","image denoising","image sequences","least mean squares methods","video coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["recursive temporal LMMSE denoising filter","video codec","video compression systems","preprocessing module","video encoder","recursive temporal linear minimum mean squared error","video sequences"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Minimum mean squared error","temporal filtering","video compression","video denoising"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Integration of Recursive Temporal LMMSE Denoising Filter Into Video Codec","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5229293/","volume":"20","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/5229293/","accessionNumber":"11105767","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"08 February 2010","publicationDate":"Feb. 2010","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 September 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2010","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Integration of Recursive Temporal LMMSE Denoising Filter Into Video Codec","sourcePdf":"tcsvt-lguo-2031453.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.11404S","chronDate":"Feb.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"76","isNumber":"5410067","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"76","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"5410067","articleId":"5229293","onlineDate":"01 September 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":5229304,"authors":[{"name":"Alexey Ozerov","affiliation":["Institut Telecom,CNRS LTCI, TELECOM ParisTech, Paris, France"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/10376/5410050/5229304/5229304-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Alexey Ozerov received the M.Sc. degree in mathematics from the Saint-Petersburg State University, Saint-Petersburg, Russia, in 1999, the M.Sc. degree in applied mathematics from the University of Bordeaux 1, Bordeaux, France, in 2003, and the Ph.D. degree in signal processing from the University of Rennes 1, Rennes, France, in 2006.","He worked towards the Ph.D. degree from 2003 to 2006 in the labs of France Telecom R&D and in collaboration with the IRISA institute.

We work in the short-time Fourier transform (STFT) domain, where convolution is routinely approximated as linear instantaneous mixing in each frequency band. Each source STFT is given a model inspired from nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) with the Itakura-Saito divergence, which underlies a statistical model of superimposed Gaussian components. We address estimation of the mixing and source parameters using two methods. The first one consists of maximizing the exact joint likelihood of the multichannel data using an expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm. The second method consists of maximizing the sum of individual likelihoods of all channels using a multiplicative update algorithm inspired from NMF methodology. Our decomposition algorithms are applied to stereo audio source separation in various settings, covering blind and supervised separation, music and speech sources, synthetic instantaneous and convolutive mixtures, as well as professionally produced music recordings. Our EM method produces competitive results with respect to state-of-the-art as illustrated on two tasks from the international Signal Separation Evaluation Campaign (SiSEC 2008).","doi":"10.1109/TASL.2009.2031510","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5410050","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TASL.2009.2031510","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/10376/5410050/05229304.pdf","startPage":"550","endPage":"563","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multichannel Nonnegative Matrix Factorization in Convolutive Mixtures for Audio Source Separation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 September 2009","displayDocTitle":"Multichannel Nonnegative Matrix Factorization in Convolutive Mixtures for Audio Source Separation","volume":"18","issue":"3","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2010","dateOfInsertion":"08 February 2010","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5229304/","publicationDate":"March 2010","accessionNumber":"11105661","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5229304/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multichannel Nonnegative Matrix Factorization in Convolutive Mixtures for Audio Source Separation","sourcePdf":"tasl-ozerov-2031510.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.107231S","chronDate":"March  2010","xplore-pub-id":"10376","isNumber":"5410050","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10376","citationCount":"373","xplore-issue":"5410050","articleId":"5229304","onlineDate":"01 September 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-21"},{"_id":5229308,"authors":[{"name":"Chen Yu","affiliation":["Psychological and Brain Sciences Department, Indiana University, Bloomington, IN, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4563672/5290358/5229308/5229308-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Chen Yu received the Ph.D. degree in computer science from the University of Rochester, Rochester, NY, in 2004.","He is currently an Assistant Professor of Psychological and Brain Sciences, Cognitive Science and Computer Science at the Indiana University\u2013Bloomington, wherein he founded and directed the Computational Cognition and Learning Laboratory.

For a natural intelligence system such as a human toddler, the relevant aspects in a learning environment are only those that make contact with the learner's sensory system. In real-world interactions, what the child perceives critically depends on his own actions as these actions bring information into and out of the learner's sensory field. The present analyses indicate how, in the case of a toddler playing with toys, these perception-action loops may simplify the learning environment by selecting relevant information and filtering irrelevant information. This paper reports new findings using a novel method that seeks to describe the visual learning environment from a young child's point of view and measures the visual information that a child perceives in real-time toy play with a parent. The main results are 1) what the child perceives primarily depends on his own actions but also his social partner's actions; 2) manual actions, in particular, play a critical role in creating visual experiences in which one object dominates; 3) this selecting and filtering of visual objects through the actions of the child provides more constrained and clean input that seems likely to facilitate cognitive learning processes. These findings have broad implications for how one studies and thinks about human and artificial learning systems.","doi":"10.1109/TAMD.2009.2031513","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Autonomous Mental Development","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Autonomous Mental Development","pdfPath":"/iel5/4563672/5290358/05229308.pdf","startPage":"141","endPage":"151","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAMD.2009.2031513","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5290358","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Active Information Selection: Visual Attention Through the Hands","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5229308/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 September 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2009","displayDocTitle":"Active Information Selection: Visual Attention Through the Hands","volume":"1","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","accessionNumber":"10929212","pubMedId":"21031153","htmlLink":"/document/5229308/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"20 October 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Active Information Selection: Visual Attention Through the Hands","sourcePdf":"01tamd02-cyu-2031513.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.147246S","chronDate":"Aug.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"4563672","isNumber":"5290358","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4563672","citationCount":"35","xplore-issue":"5290358","articleId":"5229308","onlineDate":"01 September 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5229310,"authors":[{"name":"Christina Lim","affiliation":["ARC Special Research Centre on Ultra Broadband Information Networks (CUBIN), Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University of Melbourne, VIC, Australia"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/50/5401119/5229310/5229310-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Christina Lim (S'98\u2013M'00\u2013SM'06) received the B.E.

The architecture of such radio networks requires a large number of antenna base-stations with high throughput to be deployed to maximize the geographical coverage with the main switching and routing functionalities located in a centralized location. The transportation of mm-wave wireless signals within the hybrid network is subject to several impairments including low opto-electronic conversion efficiency, fiber chromatic dispersion and also degradation due to nonlinearities along the link. One of the major technical challenges in implementing such networks lies in the mitigation of these various optical impairments that the wireless signals experience within the hybrid network. In this paper, we present an overview of different techniques to optically transport mm-wave wireless signals and to overcome impairments associated with the transport of the wireless signals. We also review the different designs of subsystems for integrating fiber-wireless technology onto existing optical infrastructure.","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/50/5401119/05229310.pdf","startPage":"390","endPage":"405","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","doi":"10.1109/JLT.2009.2031423","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JLT.2009.2031423","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5401119","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5229310","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fiber-Wireless Networks and Subsystem Technologies","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Millimeter wave technology","Optical fiber communication","Wavelength division multiplexing","WDM networks","Frequency","Bandwidth","Radio network","Throughput","Communication switching","Routing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optical fibre networks","radio access networks","wavelength division multiplexing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hybrid fiber-wireless networks","WDM technology","fixed wireless access","submillimeter-wave frequency regions","millimeter wave frequency regions","ultrahigh bandwidth communications","radio networks","antenna base stations","routing functionalities","mm-wave wireless signals","low opto-electronic conversion efficiency","fiber chromatic dispersion","optically transport mm-wave wireless signals"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Fiber-wireless","microwave photonics","optical- wireless integration","radio-over-fiber"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5229310/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.15,  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 September 2009","displayDocTitle":"Fiber-Wireless Networks and Subsystem Technologies","volume":"28","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/5229310/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb.15, 2010","accessionNumber":"11119383","dateOfInsertion":"29 January 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fiber-Wireless Networks and Subsystem Technologies","sourcePdf":"jlt-clim-2031423.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.127714S","chronDate":"Feb.15,  2010","xplore-pub-id":"50","isNumber":"5401119","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"256","xplore-issue":"5401119","articleId":"5229310","onlineDate":"01 September 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-19"},{"_id":5229312,"authors":[{"name":"Cecilia Occhiuzzi","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Informatica, Sistemi e Produzione, University of Roma Tor Vergata, Rome, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4233/5382610/5229312/5229312-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Cecilia Occhiuzzi was born in Paola, Italy, in 1983.

Compared with the traditional BDC, the inductor of the 3L BDC can be reduced significantly so that the dynamic response is greatly improved. Hence, the proposed converter is very suitable for fuel-cell/battery hybrid power systems. In addition, the voltage stress on the switch of the proposed converter is only half of the voltage on the high-voltage side, so it is also suitable for high-voltage applications. The operation principle and the implementation of the control circuit are presented in detail. This paper also proposes a novel bidirectional soft-start control strategy for the BDC. A 1-kW prototype converter is built to verify the theoretical analysis.","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2009.2031197","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/41/5463268/05229315.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2009.2031197","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5463268","startPage":"1976","endPage":"1986","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Three-Level Bidirectional Converter for Fuel-Cell/Battery Hybrid Power System","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5229315","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Three-Level Bidirectional Converter for Fuel-Cell/Battery Hybrid Power System","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5229315/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 September 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"57","issue":"6","publicationDate":"June 2010","accessionNumber":"11286122","dateOfInsertion":"27 May 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5229315/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Three-Level Bidirectional Converter for Fuel-Cell/Battery Hybrid Power System","sourcePdf":"tie-jin-2031197.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.071145S","chronDate":"June  2010","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"5463268","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"147","xplore-issue":"5463268","articleId":"5229315","onlineDate":"01 September 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-30"},{"_id":5229319,"authors":[{"name":"A.

In walking, the stride can be segmented into four different parts, and in golf and other sports, the swing is divided into sections based on the primary direction of motion. These parts are often divided based on key events, also called temporal parameters. When analyzing a movement, it is important to correctly locate these key events, and so automated techniques are needed. There exist many methods for dividing specific actions using data from specific sensors, but for new sensors or sensing positions, new techniques must be developed. We introduce a generic method for temporal parameter extraction called the hidden Markov event model based on hidden Markov models. Our method constrains the state structure to facilitate precise location of key events. This method can be quickly adapted to new movements and new sensors/sensor placements. Furthermore, it generalizes well to subjects not used for training. A multiobjective optimization technique using genetic algorithms is applied to decrease error and increase cross-subject generalizability. Further, collaborative techniques are explored. We validate this method on a walking dataset by using inertial sensors placed on various locations on a human body. Our technique is designed to be computationally complex for training, but computationally simple at runtime to allow deployment on resource-constrained sensor nodes.","doi":"10.1109/TITB.2009.2028421","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Technology in Biomedicine","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Technology in Biomedicine","pdfPath":"/iel5/4233/5300653/05229323.pdf","startPage":"1019","endPage":"1030","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TITB.2009.2028421","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5300653","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Method for Extracting Temporal Parameters Based on Hidden Markov Models in Body Sensor Networks With Inertial Sensors","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5229323","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 September 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5229323/","displayDocTitle":"A Method for Extracting Temporal Parameters Based on Hidden Markov Models in Body Sensor Networks With Inertial Sensors","volume":"13","issue":"6","publicationDate":"Nov. 2009","accessionNumber":"10957715","pubMedId":"19726268","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5229323/","dateOfInsertion":"03 November 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Method for Extracting Temporal Parameters Based on Hidden Markov Models in Body Sensor Networks With Inertial Sensors","sourcePdf":"titb-guenterberg-2028421.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.121893S","chronDate":"Nov.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"4233","isNumber":"5300653","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4233","citationCount":"35","xplore-issue":"5300653","articleId":"5229323","onlineDate":"01 September 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5229332,"authors":[{"name":"Andrew Carlson","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences, University of California, Berkeley, CA, USA","Advanced Micro Devices, Inc., Boxborough, MA, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Andrew Carlson (S'04\u2013M'08) received the S.B. degree in engineering sciences from Harvard University, Cambridge, MA, in 2003, and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from the University of California at Berkeley, Berkeley, in 2005 and 2008, respectively.","He is currently working at Advanced Micro Devices, Boxborough, MA, on technology development for the 22-nm node."]},"firstName":"Andrew","lastName":"Carlson","id":"37408027800"},{"name":"Zheng Guo","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences, University of California, Berkeley, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/92/5471724/5229332/5229332-photo-2-source-small.gif","p":["Zheng Guo received the B.S. degree in computer engineering from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Urbana, in 2003, and the M.S. degree in electrical engineering from the University of California at Berkeley, in 2005, where he is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering.","Upon graduation, he attended the University of California at Berkeley in fall of 2003.

New device architectures are being considered to improve control and reduce short channel effects. Among the likely candidates, FinFETs are the most attractive option because of their good scalability and possibilities for further SRAM performance and yield enhancement through independent gating. The enhancements to read/write margins and yield are investigated in detail for two cell designs employing independently gated FinFETs. It is shown that FinFET-based 6-T SRAM cells designed with pass-gate feedback (PGFB) achieve significant improvements in the cell read stability without area penalty. The write-ability of the cell can be improved through the use of pull-up write gating (PUWG) with a separate write word line (WWL). The benefits of these two approaches are complementary and additive, allowing for simultaneous read and write yield enhancements when the PGFB and PUWG designs are used in combination.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5229332/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 September 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2010","publicationDate":"June 2010","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5229332/","dateOfInsertion":"24 May 2010","accessionNumber":"11308160","volume":"18","issue":"6","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"SRAM Read/Write Margin Enhancements Using FinFETs","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"SRAM Read/Write Margin Enhancements Using FinFETs","sourcePdf":"tvlsi-acarlson-2019279.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.218341S","chronDate":"June  2010","xplore-pub-id":"92","isNumber":"5471724","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"50","xplore-issue":"5471724","articleId":"5229332","onlineDate":"01 September 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5229338,"authors":[{"name":"Yue Li","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Microwave and Communications, Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yue","lastName":"Li","id":"37405713200"},{"name":"Zhijun Zhang","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Microwave and Communications, Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Zhijun","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37279625900"},{"name":"Wenhua Chen","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Microwave and Communications, Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Wenhua","lastName":"Chen","id":"37279187600"},{"name":"Zhenghe Feng","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Microwave and Communications, Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Zhenghe","lastName":"Feng","id":"37278814400"},{"name":"Magdy F.

In these methods, an encoder may compute the RD costs for all the possible coding modes, and select the one which achieves the best trade-off between encoding rate and compression distortion. Previous papers have demonstrated that RD-based mode selections can lead to significant improvements in coding efficiency. RD-based mode selections, however, would incur considerable increases in encoding complexity, since these methods require computing the RD costs for numerous candidate coding modes. In this paper, we consider the scenario where software-based video encoding is performed on personal computers or game consoles, and investigate how multicore graphics processing units (GPUs) may be efficiently utilized to undertake the task of RD optimized intra-prediction mode selections in audio and video coding standards and H.264 video encoding. Achieving efficient GPU-based intra-mode decisions, however, could be nontrivial for two reasons. First, intra-mode decision tends to be sequential. Specifically, the mode decision of the current block would depend on the \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">reconstructed data</i>\n of the neighboring blocks. Therefore, the coding modes of neighboring blocks would need to be computed first before that of the current block can be determined. This dependency poses challenges to GPU-based computation, which relies heavily on parallel data processing to achieve superior speedups. Second, RD-based intra-mode decision may require conditional branchings to determine the encoding bit-rate, and these branching operations may incur substantial performance penalties when being executed on GPUs due to pipeline architectural designs. To address these issues, we analyze the data dependency in intra-mode decision, and propose novel greedy-based encoding orders to achieve highly parallel processing of data blocks. We also prove that the proposed greedy-based orders are optimal in our problem, i.e., they require the minimum number of iterations to process a video frame given the dependency constraints. In addition, we propose a method to estimate the coding rate suitable for GPU implementation. Experimental results suggest our proposed solution can be more than 50 times faster than the previously proposed parallel intra-prediction, since our work can efficiently exploit the massive parallel opportunity in GPUs.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/76/5314174/05229341.pdf","startPage":"1692","endPage":"1703","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","doi":"10.1109/TCSVT.2009.2031515","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSVT.2009.2031515","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5314174","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5229341","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Highly Parallel Rate-Distortion Optimized Intra-Mode Decision on Multicore Graphics Processors","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Rate-distortion","Multicore processing","Encoding","Video coding","Costs","Rate distortion theory","Microcomputers","Games","Computer graphics","Software standards"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["coprocessors","multiprocessing systems","video coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["rate-distortion optimized intra-mode decision","multicore graphics processor","encoding rate","rate-distortion mode selection","encoding complexity","software-based video encoding","multicore graphics processing unit","audio coding standards","video coding standards","H.264 video encoding","coding mode","parallel data processing","greedy-based encoding orders","video frame","GPU"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Graphics processing unit","greedy approach","multicore","parallel processing","rate-distortion optimized intra-prediction"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5229341/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 September 2009","displayDocTitle":"Highly Parallel Rate-Distortion Optimized Intra-Mode Decision on Multicore Graphics Processors","volume":"19","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/5229341/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2009","accessionNumber":"10964987","dateOfInsertion":"06 November 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Highly Parallel Rate-Distortion Optimized Intra-Mode Decision on Multicore Graphics Processors","sourcePdf":"tcsvt-ncheung-2031515.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.088819S","chronDate":"Nov.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"76","isNumber":"5314174","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"76","citationCount":"29","xplore-issue":"5314174","articleId":"5229341","onlineDate":"01 September 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5229342,"authors":[{"name":"Kwanho Kim","affiliation":["Division of Electrical Engineering, Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejeon, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/76/5314174/5229342/5229342-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Kwanho Kim (S'04) received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in electrical engineering and computer science from the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST), Daejeon, Korea, in 2004 and 2006, respectively.

In this paper, a configurable heterogeneous multicore architecture with a dual-mode linear processor array and a cellular neural network on the network-on-chip platform is presented for real-time object recognition. The bio-inspired attention-based object recognition algorithm is devised to reduce computational complexity of the object recognition. The cellular neural network is utilized to accelerate the visual attention algorithm for selecting salient image regions rapidly. The dual-mode parallel processor is configured into single instruction, multiple data (SIMD) or multiple-instruction-multiple-data modes to perform data-intensive image processing operations while exploiting pixel-level and feature-level parallelisms required for the attention-based object recognition. The algorithm's hybrid parallelization strategy on the proposed architecture is adopted to obtain maximum performance improvement. The performance analysis results, using a cycle-accurate architecture simulator, show that the proposed architecture achieves a speedup of 2.8 times for the target algorithm over conventional massively parallel SIMD architecture at low hardware cost overhead.

Especially for data intensive applications, the number of memory accesses is a dominant factor for these aspects. In order to meet the requirements and design a well-adapted system, the software parts need to be optimized and an adequate system and processor architecture needs to be designed. In this paper, we focus on finding an optimized memory hierarchy for bus-based architectures. Additionally, useful instruction set extensions for application-specific processor cores are explored. For complex applications, this design space exploration is difficult and requires in-depth analysis of the application and its implementation alternatives. Tools are required which aid the designer in the design, optimization, and scheduling of hardware and software.

Accessing off-chip memory generally takes an order of magnitude more time than accessing on-chip cache, and two orders of magnitude more time than executing an instruction. Computer systems and microarchitecture researchers have proposed using hardware data compression units within the memory hierarchies of microprocessors in order to improve performance, energy efficiency, and functionality. However, most past work, and all work on cache compression, has made unsubstantiated assumptions about the performance, power consumption, and area overheads of the proposed compression algorithms and hardware. It is not possible to determine whether compression at levels of the memory hierarchy closest to the processor is beneficial without understanding its costs. Furthermore, as we show in this paper, raw compression ratio is not always the most important metric. In this work, we present a lossless compression algorithm that has been designed for fast on-line data compression, and cache compression in particular. The algorithm has a number of novel features tailored for this application, including combining pairs of compressed lines into one cache line and allowing parallel compression of multiple words while using a single dictionary and without degradation in compression ratio. We reduced the proposed algorithm to a register transfer level hardware design, permitting performance, power consumption, and area estimation. Experiments comparing our work to previous work are described.","doi":"10.1109/TVLSI.2009.2020989","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/92/5518454/05229354.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVLSI.2009.2020989","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5518454","startPage":"1196","endPage":"1208","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"C-Pack: A High-Performance Microprocessor Cache Compression Algorithm","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5229354","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"C-Pack: A High-Performance Microprocessor Cache Compression Algorithm","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5229354/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 September 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"18","issue":"8","publicationDate":"Aug. 2010","accessionNumber":"11433030","dateOfInsertion":"23 July 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5229354/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"C-Pack: A High-Performance Microprocessor Cache Compression Algorithm","sourcePdf":"tvlsi-xchen-2020989-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.079409S","chronDate":"Aug.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"92","isNumber":"5518454","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"65","xplore-issue":"5518454","articleId":"5229354","onlineDate":"01 September 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5229357,"authors":[{"name":"Ali Tajer","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Ali","lastName":"Tajer","id":"38577078800"},{"name":"Narayan Prasad","affiliation":["NEC Laboratories of America, Inc., Princeton, NJ, USA"],"firstName":"Narayan","lastName":"Prasad","id":"37284625900"},{"name":"Xiaodong Wang","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Xiaodong","lastName":"Wang","id":"37281375000"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1053-587X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0476"}],"articleNumber":"5229357","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":69,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1234},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.signalprocessingsociety.org"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5229357","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Array signal processing","Cognitive radio","Maximum likelihood decoding","Interference","Radio transmitters","Algorithm design and analysis","Distributed algorithms","Receivers","Protection","National electric code"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","array signal processing","cognitive radio","maximum likelihood decoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MISO cognitive radio networks","distributed beamforming","rate allocation","decentralized multiantenna cognitive radio networks","limited weighted sum-power budget","Gaussian interferers","maximum likelihood decoder","unconstrained group decoder","suboptimal distributed algorithms","beamformer design algorithms"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Beamforming","cognitive radio","fairness","rate allocation","successive group decoder"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TSP.2009.2031280","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/5353758/05229357.pdf","startPage":"362","endPage":"377","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2009.2031280","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5353758","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Beamforming and Rate Allocation in MISO Cognitive Radio Networks","abstract":"We consider decentralized multiantenna cognitive radio networks where the secondary (cognitive) users are granted simultaneous spectrum access along with the license-holding (primary) users. We treat the problem of distributed beamforming and rate allocation for the secondary users such that the minimum weighted secondary rate is maximized. Such an optimization is subject to (1) a limited weighted sum-power budget for the secondary users and (2) guaranteed protection for the primary users in the sense that the interference level imposed on each primary receiver does not exceed a specified level. Based on the decoding method deployed by the secondary receivers, we consider three scenarios for solving this problem. In the first scenario, each secondary receiver decodes only its designated transmitter while suppressing the rest as Gaussian interferers (single-user decoding). In the second case, each secondary receiver employs the maximum likelihood decoder (MLD) to jointly decode all secondary transmissions. In the third one, each secondary receiver uses the unconstrained group decoder (UGD). By deploying the UGD, each secondary user is allowed to decode any arbitrary subset of users (which contains its designated user) after suppressing or canceling the remaining users. We offer an optimal distributed algorithm for designing the beamformers and allocating rates in the first scenario (i.e., with single-user decoding). We also provide explicit formulations of the optimization problems for the latter two scenarios (with the MLD and the UGD, respectively), which, however are nonconvex. While we provide a suboptimal centralized algorithm for the case with MLD, neither of the two scenarios can be solved efficiently in a decentralized setup. As a remedy, we offer two-stage suboptimal distributed algorithms for solving the problem for the MLD and UGD scenarios. In the first stage, the beamformers and rates are determined in a distributed fashion after assuming single user decoding at each secondary receiver. By using these beamformer designs, MLD often and UGD always allow for supporting rates higher than those achieved in the first stage. Based on this observation, we construct the second stage by offering optimal distributed low-complexity algorithms to allocate excess rates to the secondary users such that a notion of fairness is maintained. Analytical and empirical results demonstrate the gains yielded by the proposed rate allocation and the beamformer design algorithms.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5229357/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 September 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2010","publicationDate":"Jan. 2010","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"15 December 2009","accessionNumber":"11020518","volume":"58","issue":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Beamforming and Rate Allocation in MISO Cognitive Radio Networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Beamforming and Rate Allocation in MISO Cognitive Radio Networks","sourcePdf":"58tsp01-xwang-2031280.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.040885S","chronDate":"Jan.  2010","isNumber":"5353758","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"69","articleId":"5229357","onlineDate":"01 September 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5229479,"authors":[{"name":"Chin-Lung Su","affiliation":["R&D Dept., Skymedi Corp., Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chin-Lung","lastName":"Su","id":"37281255100"},{"name":"Chih-Wea Tsai","affiliation":["R&D Dept., Skymedi Corp., Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chih-Wea","lastName":"Tsai","id":"37833234400"},{"name":"Ching-Yi Chen","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Ching-Yi","lastName":"Chen","id":"37406734300"},{"name":"Wan-Yu Lo","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Wan-Yu","lastName":"Lo","id":"37664128100"},{"name":"Cheng-Wen Wu","affiliation":["Industrial Technology Research Institute, SoC Technology Center, Hsinchu, Taiwan","Department of Electrical Engineering, National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Cheng-Wen","lastName":"Wu","id":"37276423200"},{"name":"Ji-Jan Chen","affiliation":["Industrial Technology Research Institute, SoC Technology Center, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Ji-Jan","lastName":"Chen","id":"37351180500"},{"name":"Wen-Ching Wu","affiliation":["Industrial Technology Research Institute, SoC Technology Center, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Wen-Ching","lastName":"Wu","id":"37280430300"},{"name":"Chien-Chung Hung","affiliation":["Electronics and Opto-Electronics Research Laboratory, Industrial Technology and Research Institute, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chien-Chung","lastName":"Hung","id":"37289819400"},{"name":"Ming-Jer Kao","affiliation":["Electronics and Opto-Electronics Research Laboratory, Industrial Technology and Research Institute, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Ming-Jer","lastName":"Kao","id":"37285787200"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-8210"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9999"}],"articleNumber":"5229479","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":480},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Circuits and Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieee-cas.org/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computer Society","url":"http://www.computer.org/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Solid-State Circuits Society","url":"http://www.sscs.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5229479","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fault diagnosis","Circuit testing","Built-in self-test","Circuit faults","CMOS technology","Fault detection","Circuit stability","Automatic testing","Prototypes","Semiconductor device measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["built-in self test","CMOS digital integrated circuits","fault diagnosis","magnetic storage","random-access storage"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MRAM write disturbance fault","magnetic RAM","adaptive diagnosis algorithm","process stability","built-in self-test circuit","CMOS technology","chip measurement","size 0.15 mum","memory size 1 MByte"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Fault diagnosis","magnetic RAM (MRAM)","memory testing","nonvolatile memory","write disturbance fault (WDF)"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we propose a new test method to detect write disturbance fault (WDF) for magnetic RAM (MRAM).

A new FC verification approach is proposed that eliminates the need for testing FC in the intermediate configurations of the local planner. The algorithm is tested for special kinds of planar robots that have two wheeled-tip fingers. The wheels are actuated and can roll along the object's edges. We propose a general planning algorithm for this new mechanism without any limitations on the fingers structure and the task. The algorithm is implemented and the simulation results in ADAMS verify the validity of our algorithm.","doi":"10.1109/AIM.2009.5229724","pdfPath":"/iel5/5211950/5229709/05229724.pdf","startPage":"1040","endPage":"1046","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE/ASME International Conference on Advanced Intelligent Mechatronics","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE/ASME International Conference on Advanced Intelligent Mechatronics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/AIM.2009.5229724","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5229709","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A probabilistic roadmap based planning algorithm for wheeled-tip robots manipulating polygonal objects","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5229724/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-17 July 2009","displayDocTitle":"A probabilistic roadmap based planning algorithm for wheeled-tip robots manipulating polygonal objects","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"01 September 2009","accessionNumber":"10864724","publicationDate":"July 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5229724/","conferenceDate":"14-17 July 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A probabilistic roadmap based planning algorithm for wheeled-tip robots manipulating polygonal objects","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"rp0177-0331.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060876S","chronDate":"14-17 July 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5211950","isNumber":"5229709","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5211950","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5229709","articleId":"5229724","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":5229811,"authors":[{"name":"Syuan-Yi Chen","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Central University, Chungli, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Syuan-Yi Chen","id":"37403401800"},{"name":"Faa-Jeng Lin","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Central University, Chungli, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Faa-Jeng Lin","id":"37272521300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2852-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2853-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2854-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2159-6247"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2159-6255"}],"articleNumber":"5229811","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":248},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Nonlinear control systems","Control systems","MIMO","Magnetic levitation","Neural networks","Magnets","Nonlinear dynamical systems","Mathematical model","Trajectory","Taylor series"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["backpropagation","magnetic levitation","mechanical variables control","MIMO systems","neural nets","nonlinear control systems","position control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO magnetic levitation system","nonlinear control","decentralized neural network","reference trajectory tracking","connective weights","backpropagation","controller design"]}],"abstract":"A direct modified Elman neural networks (MENNs)-based decentralized controller is proposed to control the magnets of a nonlinear and unstable multi-input multi-output (MIMO) levitation system for the tracking of reference trajectory.

Then, due to the exact dynamic model of the MIMO magnetic levitation system is not clear, two MENNs are combined to be a direct MENN-based decentralized controller to deal with the highly nonlinear and unstable MIMO magnetic levitation system. Moreover, the connective weights of the MENNs are trained online by backpropagation (BP) methodology.

However, currently most humanoids use the ZMP (Zero Moment Point) for control of bipedal locomotion, which requires precise modeling and actuation with high control gains. On the contrary, researchers do not rely on such precise modeling and actuation. In this paper we have tried to introduce a novel method for the evolution of walking behavior in a simulated humanoid robot with up to 22 degrees of freedom. In this method a modified Truncated Fourier Series (TFS) generates walking angular trajectories and it is optimized by genetic algorithm. By studying human walking TFS parameters have also been reduced. As a test-bed, we chose Robocup 3D soccer simulation environment (spark) and implemented our method in MRL 3D team's agents. Experimental results show that training of the robot can be successfully performed by our method, thus allowing the biped robot to walk fast, stably and straightly.","doi":"10.1109/AIM.2009.5229814","startPage":"1781","endPage":"1785","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE/ASME International Conference on Advanced Intelligent

to parallel manipulators. Based on genetic algorithms (GA), a non-linear equation system solving problem is converted into an optimization one. The majority of truly parallel manipulators can be modeled by the 6-6 which is an hexapod constituted by a fixed base and a mobile platform attached to six kinematics chains with linear (prismatic) actuators located between two ball joints. Parallel manipulator kinematics are formulated using the explicit inverse kinematics model (IKM). The position based equation system is implemented. In order to implement GA, the objective function is formulated specifically for the FKP using one squared error performance criteria applied on the leg lengths augmented by three platform joint distances. The proposed approach implements an elitist selection process where a new mutation operator for real-coded GA is analyzed. These experiments are the first to converge towards several exact solutions on a general Gough platform manipulator with fast convergence.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-17 July 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5229824/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10864782","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5229824/","publicationDate":"July 2009","dateOfInsertion":"01 September 2009","conferenceDate":"14-17 July 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Forward kinematics of the 6-6 general parallel manipulator using Real Coded Genetic Algorithms","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Forward kinematics of the 6-6 general parallel manipulator using Real Coded Genetic Algorithms","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"rp0278-0221.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057611S","chronDate":"14-17 July 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5211950","isNumber":"5229709","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5211950","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"5229709","articleId":"5229824","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":5229826,"authors":[{"name":"Ting-Chia Ou","affiliation":["National Sun Yat-sen University, Kaohsiung, TW"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5211950/5229709/5229826/5229826-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Ting-Chia Ou (M'05) was born in 1971.

A major challenge in this problem is overcoming errors and imprecision in locating the unknown position of a randomly deployed sensor.

Thus, if the result from localization is inaccurate, then future processes would be tainted with error. We propose a new approach for cooperative object localization by a group of communicating sensors.

Reference current calculated from virtual wall was used for the energy calculation instead of measured motor current to avoid signal noise. The simplified FPGA based PO/PC approach is compared with the software based approach. The experimental results show that the noise behavior during low velocity contact is dramatically reduced.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Field programmable gate arrays","Damping","Haptic interfaces","Stability","Virtual environment","Sampling methods","Hardware","Working environment noise","Educational technology","Parallel processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["control engineering computing","field programmable gate arrays","haptic interfaces","observers","parallel processing","stability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FPGA based time domain passivity observer","passivity controller","field programmable gate array","haptic interfaces","stability range","PO-PC algorithm","sampling rate","parallel processing ability","software based approach"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5229976","doi":"10.1109/AIM.2009.5229976","startPage":"433","endPage":"438","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE/ASME International Conference on Advanced Intelligent Mechatronics","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE/ASME International Conference on Advanced Intelligent Mechatronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/5211950/5229709/05229976.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5229709","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/AIM.2009.5229976","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5229976/","displayDocTitle":"FPGA based time domain Passivity Observer and Passivity Controller","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"14-17 July 2009","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2009","dateOfInsertion":"01 September 2009","accessionNumber":"10867276","htmlLink":"/document/5229976/","conferenceDate":"14-17 July 2009","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FPGA based time domain Passivity Observer and Passivity Controller","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"rp0074-0171.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.083182S","chronDate":"14-17 July 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5211950","isNumber":"5229709","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5211950","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"5229709","articleId":"5229976","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5229989,"authors":[{"name":"B.

The method is using an optimization algorithm to find the switching states that provide the best approximation of the required mean output voltage across each actuator. Subsequently, the method is used to evaluate the performance of the switched mode amplifier. The evaluation results show that although the proposed switch mode amplifier configuration reduces the number of switches per actuator, it imposes restrictions on the range of output mean voltages that are obtainable across each actuator.","doi":"10.1109/AIM.2009.5229989","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/AIM.2009.5229989","startPage":"344","endPage":"349","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE/ASME International Conference on Advanced Intelligent Mechatronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/5211950/5229709/05229989.pdf","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE/ASME International Conference on Advanced Intelligent Mechatronics","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5229709","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Control and performance evaluation of switch mode amplifier for actuator array","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"14-17 July 2009","displayDocTitle":"Control and performance evaluation of switch mode amplifier for actuator array","conferenceDate":"14-17 July 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2009","dateOfInsertion":"01 September 2009","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5229989/","accessionNumber":"10864876","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5229989/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Control and performance evaluation of switch mode amplifier for actuator array","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"rp0059-0361.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05799S","chronDate":"14-17 July 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5211950","isNumber":"5229709","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5211950","xplore-issue":"5229709","articleId":"5229989","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"}]
