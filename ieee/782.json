Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) provide a promising opportunity to improve performance, security and energy efficiency because their hardware architecture can be adapted directly to the application. In this paper we present the development of our FPGA cloud architecture, beginning with realistic use cases and adapted service models for the use of reconfigurable hardware accelerators in a cloud context. Our architecture supports both applications where FPGAs are tightly coupled to host processors and applications using the FPGA for a secured cloud access in an overall homogeneous system. In contrast to other approaches, we model the system as a whole with a more flexible FPGA provision. The application service provider has the opportunity to offer a service with an individual FPGA design or customized secure interfaces to the cloud. For an abstraction from the real hardware and to achieve high device utilization, the FPGAs and the interfaces are fully virtualized. Because of the uncommon reconfigurable hardware integration and our adapted service models, we developed a special resource management system (RC3E) which serves as a hypervisor for the virtualized hardware. The demonstration of an intelligent load balancing as well as the system's performance and flexibility conclude our approach of FPGA services in a cloud.","doi":"10.1109/CLOUD.2016.0013","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE 9th International Conference on Cloud Computing (CLOUD)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7819578/7820017/07820030.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7820017","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CLOUD.2016.0013","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE 9th International Conference on Cloud Computing (CLOUD)","startPage":"19","endPage":"26","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"RC3E: Reconfigurable Accelerators in Data Centres and Their Provision by Adapted Service Models","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7820030","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 27 2016-July 2 2016","displayDocTitle":"RC3E: Reconfigurable Accelerators in Data Centres and Their Provision by Adapted Service Models","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7820030/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7820030/","publicationDate":"June 2016","accessionNumber":"16617390","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2017","conferenceDate":"27 June-2 July 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"RC3E: Reconfigurable Accelerators in Data Centres and Their Provision by Adapted Service Models","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"2619a019.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.084662S","chronDate":"June 27 2016-July 2 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7819578","isNumber":"7820017","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7819578","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"7820017","articleId":"7820030","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-08"},{"_id":7820036,"authors":[{"name":"Manabu Sakai","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Information Systems, Osaka Prefecture University, Sakai, Osaka, Japan"],"firstName":"Manabu","lastName":"Sakai","orcid":"0000-0001-7156-1954","id":"37085392519"},{"name":"Hai Lin","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Information Systems, Osaka Prefecture University, Sakai, Osaka, Japan"],"firstName":"Hai","lastName":"Lin","id":"37279366400"},{"name":"Katsumi Yamashita","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Information Systems, Osaka Prefecture University, Sakai, Osaka, Japan"],"firstName":"Katsumi","lastName":"Yamashita","id":"37268934800"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-7798"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2558"},{"format":"CD","value":"2373-7891"}],"articleNumber":"7820036","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":529},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7820036","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interference","Encryption","OFDM","Loading","Channel estimation","Robustness","Time-frequency analysis"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["OFDM/OQAM","physical layer encryption"]}],"abstract":"A physical layer encryption method is proposed for orthogonal frequency division multiplexing with offset quadrature amplitude modulation.

The selection becomes important whenever the target values, which guide the update of the regressors as well as the implicit model structures, are costly or time-consuming to measure and also in case when very fast models updates are required to cope with stream mining real-time demands. Reducing the selected samples as much as possible while keeping the predictive accuracy of the models on a high level is, thus, a central challenge. This should be ideally achieved in unsupervised and single-pass manner. Our selection criteria rely on three aspects: 1) the extrapolation degree combined with the model's nonlinearity degree , which is measured in terms of a new specific homogeneity criterion among adjacent local approximators; 2) the uncertainty in model outputs, which can be measured in terms of confidence intervals using so-called adaptive local error bars - we integrate a weighted localization of an incremental noise level estimator and propose formulas for online merging of local error bars; 3) the uncertainty in model parameters, which is estimated by the so-called A-optimality criterion, which relies on the Fisher information matrix. The selection criteria are developed in combination with evolving generalized Takagi-Sugeno (TS) fuzzy models (containing rules in arbitrarily rotated position), as it could be shown in previous publications that these outperform conventional evolving TS models (containing axis-parallel rules). The results based on three high-dimensional real-world streaming problems show that a model update based on only 10%-20% selected samples can still achieve similar accumulated model errors over time to the case when performing a full model update on all samples. This can be achieved with a negligible sensitivity on the size of the active learning latency buffer. Random sampling with the same percentages of samples selected, however, achieved much higher error rates. Hence, the intelligence in our sample selection concept leads to an economic balance between model accuracy and measurement as well computational costs for model updates.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Data models","Biological system modeling","Computational modeling","Adaptation models","Uncertainty","Data mining","Context modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["approximation theory","data mining","fuzzy set theory","learning (artificial intelligence)","regression analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["online active learning context","implicit model structures","selection criteria","adjacent local approximators","model outputs","adaptive local error bars","weighted localization","incremental noise level estimator","online merging","model parameters","generalized Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy models","real-world streaming problems","model update","random sampling","sample selection concept","model accuracy","uncertainty sampling","generalized fuzzy models","data stream regression problems","stream mining"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Active learning latency buffer (ALLB)","data stream regression","evolving generalized Takagi\u2013Sugeno (TS) fuzzy systems","extrapolation degree","nonlinearity degree","online active learning","single-pass uncertainty-based sampling","uncertainty in model outputs and parameters"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TFUZZ.2017.2654504","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/91/8278217/07820039.pdf","startPage":"292","endPage":"309","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8278217","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TFUZZ.2017.2654504","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Online Active Learning in Data Stream Regression Using Uncertainty Sampling Based on Evolving Generalized Fuzzy Models","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7820039","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Online Active Learning in Data Stream Regression Using Uncertainty Sampling Based on Evolving Generalized Fuzzy Models","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7820039/","volume":"26","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Feb. 2018","htmlLink":"/document/7820039/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"17541870","dateOfInsertion":"01 February 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2018","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 January 2017","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Austrian COMET-K2 programme of the Linz Center of Mechatronics (LCM)"},{"fundingName":"Austrian federal government and the federal state of Upper Austria"},{"fundingName":"Latrobe University, Australia"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Online Active Learning in Data Stream Regression Using Uncertainty Sampling Based on Evolving Generalized Fuzzy Models","sourcePdf":"tfuzz-lughofer-2654504-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.08286S","chronDate":"Feb.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"91","isNumber":"8278217","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"91","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"8278217","articleId":"7820039","onlineDate":"17 January 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":7820046,"authors":[{"name":"Ke Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Electronic and Communication Engineering, North China Electric Power University, Baoding, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/76/8372808/7820046/zhang-2654543-small.gif","p":["Ke Zhang (M\u201916) received the M.E. degree in signal and information processing from North China Electric Power University, Baoding, China, in 2006 and the Ph.D. degree in signal and information processing from Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China, in 2012.","He is an Associate Professor with North China Electric Power University, Baoding.

This paper proposes a novel residual network architecture, residual networks of residual networks (RoR), to dig the optimization ability of residual networks. RoR substitutes optimizing residual mapping of residual mapping for optimizing original residual mapping. In particular, RoR adds levelwise shortcut connections upon original residual networks to promote the learning capability of residual networks. More importantly, RoR can be applied to various kinds of residual networks (ResNets, Pre-ResNets, and WRN) and significantly boost their performance. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and versatility of RoR, where it achieves the best performance in all residual-network-like structures. Our RoR-3-WRN58-4 + SD models achieve new state-of-the-art results on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and SVHN, with the test errors of 3.77%, 19.73%, and 1.59%, respectively.

Using a simple stochastic geometry model, we concretely demonstrate that this bottleneck can be loosened if the users are mobile.

Since an LED lamp covers a small area, a LiFi system with multiple access points (APs) can offer a significantly high spatial throughput. However, the spatial distribution of data rates achieved by LiFi fluctuates because users experience inter-cell interference from neighboring LiFi APs. In order to guarantee a quality of service (QoS) for all users in the network, an RF network is considered as an additional wireless networking layer. This hybrid LiFi/RF network enables users with low levels of optical signals to achieve the desired QoS by migrating to the RF network. With regard to moving users, the hybrid LiFi/RF system dynamically allocates either a LiFi AP or an RF AP to users based on their channel state information. In this paper, a dynamic load balancing scheme is proposed, which considers the handover overhead in order to improve the overall system throughput. Joint optimization algorithm (JOA) and separate optimization algorithm (SOA), which jointly and separately optimize the AP assignment and resource allocation, respectively, are proposed. Simulation results show that SOA can offer a better performance/complexity tradeoff than JOA for system load balancing.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2017.2654249","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/7900485/07820066.pdf","startPage":"1708","endPage":"1720","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7900485","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2017.2654249","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimization of Load Balancing in Hybrid LiFi/RF Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7820066","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2017","displayDocTitle":"Optimization of Load Balancing in Hybrid LiFi/RF Networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7820066/","publicationDate":"April 2017","dateOfInsertion":"14 April 2017","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"16808438","htmlLink":"/document/7820066/","volume":"65","issue":"4","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 January 2017","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"EPSRC under Established Career Fellowship","grantNumber":"EP/K008757/1"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimization of Load Balancing in Hybrid LiFi/RF Networks","sourcePdf":"tcomm-wang-2654249-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.151529S","chronDate":"April  2017","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"7900485","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"62","xplore-issue":"7900485","articleId":"7820066","onlineDate":"17 January 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7820073,"authors":[{"name":"Pranay Agarwal","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, IIT Hyderabad, Hyderabad, India"],"firstName":"Pranay","lastName":"Agarwal","id":"37086189471"},{"name":"Dhanuja Elizabeth Thomas","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, IIT Hyderabad, Hyderabad, India"],"firstName":"Dhanuja Elizabeth","lastName":"Thomas","id":"37086188181"},{"name":"Abhinav Kumar","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, IIT Hyderabad, Hyderabad, India"],"firstName":"Abhinav","lastName":"Kumar","orcid":"0000-0002-6468-7054","id":"37086191284"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-7798"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2558"},{"format":"CD","value":"2373-7891"}],"articleNumber":"7820073","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":523},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7820073","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Security","Handover","Computational complexity","Probability density function","Closed-form solutions","Computational modeling"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["De-synchronization attack","handover key management","Hyper-Erlang distribution","LTE/SAE architecture"]}],"abstract":"In this letter, we analyze the security of a long term evolution/system architecture evolution-based network in the presence of de-synchronization attack.

Firstly the structure of neural network (NN) is constructed. Meanwhile, the key parameters of NN are encoded as the position vector of a particle in the PSO algorithm.

However, predicting the trust rate of a cloud service based on its multifaceted quality of services (QoSs) is not an easy task due to the complicated and non-linear relations between service's QoS values and the final trust rate of the service. According to the existing studies, the adoption of intelligent technique is a rational way to attack this problem. Neural network (NN) has been validated as an effective way to predict the trust rate of the service. However, the parameter setting of NN, which plays an important role in its prediction performance, has not been properly addressed yet. In the paper, particle swarm optimization (PSO) is introduced to enhance NN by optimizing its initial settings. In the proposed hybrid prediction algorithm named PSO-NN, PSO is used to search the appropriate parameters for NN so as to realize accurate trust prediction of cloud services. In order to investigate the effectiveness of PSO-NN, extensive experiments are performed based on public QoS data set, as well as in-depth comparison analysis. The results show that our proposed approach has better performance than basic classification methods in most cases, and significantly outperforms the basic NN in the terms of prediction precision. In addition, PSO-NN demonstrates better stability than the basic NN.","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2654378","startPage":"2187","endPage":"2199","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/7859429/07820074.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2654378","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7859429","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Towards a Trust Prediction Framework for Cloud Services Based on PSO-Driven Neural Network","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Quality of service","Biological neural networks","Neurons","Cloud computing","Particle swarm optimization","Predictive models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","neural nets","particle swarm optimisation","quality of service","trusted computing","Web services"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["trust rate prediction framework","cloud services","PSO-driven neural network","trustworthiness","service selection","service recommendation","multifaceted quality-of-services","service QoS values","service trust rate","intelligent technique","particle swarm optimization","hybrid prediction algorithm","PSO-NN","parameter search","trust prediction","public QoS data set"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cloud services","quality of service (QoS)","trust prediction","neural network","particle swarm optimization (PSO)"]}],"topic":"Trust Management in Pervasive Social Networking (TruPSN)","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7820074/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 January 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"2017","displayDocTitle":"Towards a Trust Prediction Framework for Cloud Services Based on PSO-Driven Neural Network","volume":"5","htmlLink":"/document/7820074/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"2017","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","isOpenAccess":true,"accessionNumber":"16720316","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61462030"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004479","fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of Jiangxi Province","grantNumber":"20162BCB23036 and 20151BAB207018"},{"fundingName":"Science Foundation of Jiangxi Educational Committee","grantNumber":"GJJ150465"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Towards a Trust Prediction Framework for Cloud Services Based on PSO-Driven Neural Network","sourcePdf":"access-mao-2654378-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.103253S","chronDate":"2017","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"7859429","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"30","xplore-issue":"7859429","topics":["Trust Management in Pervasive Social Networking (TruPSN)"],"articleId":"7820074","onlineDate":"17 January 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":7820084,"authors":[{"name":"Mohsen Jamalabdollahi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Michigan Technological University, Houghton, MI, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/7879183/7820084/jamal-2654240-small.gif","p":["Mohsen Jamalabdollahi (S\u201915) received the B.Sc. degree in electrical engineering from the University of Mazandaran, Babol, Iran, in 2003, the M.Sc. degree from the K.

Here, the maximum rising level detector technique is proposed which utilizes oversampling and multiple correlation paths to evaluate with high resolution the path corresponding to the maximum rising level of matched filters output. However, employing such technique demands for transmission of waveform that creates a very high rising level at autocorrelation center. This paper proposes an efficient technique to design proper waveforms (very high rising level at autocorrelation center) via minimization of weighted integrated sidelobe level, exploiting the trust-region algorithm. The performance of the proposed technique is evaluated via simulations of the ToA mean square error, and compared with the state-of-the-art approaches considering the same bandwidth, and Cramer-Rao lower bound as benchmark. Simulations confirm that the ToA resolution is improved as the number of correlation paths increases and verify the feasibility of the proposed technique compared with the available approaches for the MPFS channels.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2017.2654240","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2017.2654240","startPage":"1207","endPage":"1218","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/7879183/07820084.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7879183","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High Resolution ToA Estimation via Optimal Waveform Design","chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/26/7879183/7820084-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7820084/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 January 2017","displayDocTitle":"High Resolution ToA Estimation via Optimal Waveform Design","volume":"65","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"15 March 2017","accessionNumber":"16743413","publicationDate":"March 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7820084/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"NSF","grantNumber":"ECCS 1101843"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","chorusFlag":"true","title":"High Resolution ToA Estimation via Optimal Waveform Design","sourcePdf":"tcomm-jamalabdollahi-2654240-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.105608S","chronDate":"March  2017","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"7879183","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"7879183","articleId":"7820084","onlineDate":"17 January 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7820086,"authors":[{"name":"Bin Liao","affiliation":["Shenzhen University, Shenzhen, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7/7905775/7820086/liao-2650578-small.gif","p":["Bin\u00a0Liao (S\u201909\u2013M\u201913\u2013SM\u201916)\n received the B.Eng. and M.Eng degrees in electronic engineering from Xidian University, Xi\u2019an, China, in 2006\n and 2009, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree from The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, in 2013.","From September 2013 to January 2014, he was a Research Assistant with the Department of Electrical and Electronic\n Engineering, The University of Hong Kong, where he was a Research Scientist from August 2016 to October 2016.

However, most of the existing approaches inherently rely on assuming an exactly known array manifold, but have not yet addressed the issue of robust beamforming with precise main beam control in the presence of arbitrary steering vector uncertainties. This motivates us to develop a robust beamforming approach that is capable of accurately controlling the array main beam. Unlike the conventional methods, steering vector uncertainties are taken into account in the magnitude response constraints of the adaptive beamformer. This allows us to control the main beam as prescribed. As the resultant nonconvex problem has a more complicated formulation than that of the existing methods, techniques developed for solving the problem of robust beamforming with magnitude response constraints cannot be employed directly. To tackle this problem, the lower and upper norm bounds of the beamformer weight vector are derived. The semidefinite relaxation technique is then employed as approximate solver, ending up with iterative, grid search, and linearization solutions. Simulation results show that the proposed methods are able to precisely control the main beam magnitude response in the presence of steering vector uncertainties.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAES.2017.2650578","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7905775","startPage":"345","endPage":"356","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/7/7905775/07820086.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robust Adaptive Beamforming With Precise Main Beam Control","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7820086/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 January 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7820086/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Robust Adaptive Beamforming With Precise Main Beam Control","publicationDate":"Feb. 2017","accessionNumber":"16823843","dateOfInsertion":"24 April 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"53","issue":"1","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61401284, 61471365 and 61601307"},{"fundingName":"Foundation of Shenzhen","grantNumber":"JCYJ20140418091413566 and 827-000071"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust Adaptive Beamforming With Precise Main Beam Control","sourcePdf":"taes-huang-2650578-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.161637S","chronDate":"Feb.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"7","isNumber":"7905775","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7","citationCount":"44","xplore-issue":"7905775","articleId":"7820086","onlineDate":"17 January 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":7820087,"authors":[{"name":"Yanni Dong","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Information Engineering in Surveying, Mapping, and Remote Sensing, Wuhan University, Wuhan, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/36/7880748/7820087/dong-2645703-small.gif","p":["Yanni Dong (S\u201914) received the B.S. degree in sciences and techniques of remote sensing from Wuhan University, Wuhan, China, in 2012, where she is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree with the State Key Laboratory of Information Engineering in Surveying, Mapping and Remote Sensing.","Her current research interests include pattern recognition in remote sensing images, hyperspectral image processing, and metric learning."]},"firstName":"Yanni","lastName":"Dong","id":"37085405215"},{"name":"Bo Du","affiliation":["School of Computer, Wuhan University, Wuhan, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/36/7880748/7820087/du-2645703-small.gif","p":["Bo Du (M\u201910\u2013SM\u201915) received the B.S. and Ph.D. degrees in photogrammetry and remote sensing from the State Key Laboratory of Information Engineering in Surveying, Mapping and Remote sensing, Wuhan University, Wuhan, China, in 2005 and 2010, respectively.","He was with the Center for Quantum Computation and Intelligent Systems, University of Technology Sydney, Ultimo, NSW, Australia.

To avoid these problems, we use distance metric learning for dimensionality reduction. The goal of distance metric learning is to incorporate abundant discriminative information by reducing the dimensionality of the data. Considering that global metric learning is not appropriate for all training samples, this paper proposes an ensemble discriminative local metric learning (EDLML) algorithm for HSI analysis. The EDLML algorithm learns robust local metrics from both the training samples and the relative neighborhood of them and considers the different local discriminative distance metrics by dealing with the data region by region. It aims to learn a subspace to keep all the samples in the same class are as near as possible, while those from different classes are separated. The learned local metrics are then used to build an ensemble metric. Experiments on a number of different hyperspectral data sets confirm the effectiveness of the proposed EDLML algorithm compared with that of the other dimension reduction methods.","doi":"10.1109/TGRS.2016.2645703","startPage":"2509","endPage":"2524","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote

The available measurements at each sensing node are collected not only from the individual sensor but also from its neighbors according to the given topology. A new deception attack model is proposed where the malicious signals are injected by the adversary into both control and measurement data during the process of information transmission via the communication network. By resorting to the recursive linear matrix inequality approach, a sufficient condition is established for the existence of the desired filter satisfying the prespecified requirements on the estimation error variance. Subsequently, an optimization problem is formulated in order to seek the filter parameters ensuring the locally optimal filtering performance at each time instant. Finally, an illustrative example is presented to demonstrate the effectiveness and applicability of the proposed algorithm.","doi":"10.1109/JSEN.2017.2654325","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Sensors Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/7361/7874221/07820092.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7874221","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSEN.2017.2654325","publicationTitle":"IEEE Sensors Journal","startPage":"2279","endPage":"2288","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Variance-Constrained Distributed Filtering for Time-Varying Systems With Multiplicative Noises and Deception Attacks Over Sensor Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7820092","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"April1, 1 2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 January 2017","displayDocTitle":"Variance-Constrained Distributed Filtering for Time-Varying Systems With Multiplicative Noises and Deception Attacks Over Sensor Networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7820092/","volume":"17","issue":"7","htmlLink":"/document/7820092/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"1 April1, 2017","accessionNumber":"16724976","dateOfInsertion":"08 March 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities","grantNumber":"30916011337"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61304010 and 61329301"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002858","fundingName":"Postdoctoral Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"2014M551598"},{"fundingName":"International Postdoctoral Exchange Fellowship from the China Postdoctoral Council"},{"fundingName":"Alexander von Humboldt Foundation of Germany"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Variance-Constrained Distributed Filtering for Time-Varying Systems With Multiplicative Noises and Deception Attacks Over Sensor Networks","sourcePdf":"jsen-wang-2654325-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.091751S","chronDate":"April1, 1 2017","xplore-pub-id":"7361","isNumber":"7874221","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7361","citationCount":"92","xplore-issue":"7874221","articleId":"7820092","onlineDate":"17 January 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-11"},{"_id":7820093,"authors":[{"name":"Jong-Hyeok Park","affiliation":["Department of Creative IT Engineering, Pohang University of Science and Technology, Pohang, South Korea"],"firstName":"Jong-Hyeok","lastName":"Park","id":"37086125374"},{"name":"Yo-Seb Jeon","affiliation":["Future IT Innovation Laboratory, Pohang University of Science and Technology, Pohang, South Korea"],"firstName":"Yo-Seb","lastName":"Jeon","id":"37085625220"},{"name":"Soohee Han","affiliation":["Department of Creative IT Engineering, Pohang University of Science and Technology, Pohang, South Korea"],"firstName":"Soohee","lastName":"Han","orcid":"0000-0002-9831-3499","id":"37085692363"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-7798"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2558"},{"format":"CD","value":"2373-7891"}],"articleNumber":"7820093","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":17,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":939},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Array signal processing","Information rates","Interference","Convex functions","RF signals","MIMO","Linear programming"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Energy harvesting","simultaneous wireless information power transfer (SWIPT)","beamformer design","convex maximization (CM)","difference of convex functions (DC)"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7820093","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/4234/7921536/07820093.pdf","startPage":"1163","endPage":"1166","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LCOMM.2017.2654254","doi":"10.1109/LCOMM.2017.2654254","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7921536","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Energy Beamforming for Wireless Power Transfer in MISO Heterogeneous Network With Power Beacon","abstract":"This letter considers an energy harvesting heterogeneous network (EHHN) in which a power beacon (PB) for radio-frequency-energy transfer coexists with a base station for information transfer. In this network, a tradeoff exists between harvested energy and information rate, because the energy transfer of the PB causes the interference to the information transfer. To determine the optimal energy-transfer strategy under this tradeoff, we propose an energy beamforming scheme that maximizes the weighted sum of the harvested energy and the information rate in multiple-input single-output EHHN. Because the weighted-sum-maximization problem is nonconvex, we partition it into a difference of convex functions problem and a convex-maximization problem, and then solve them using efficient convex-based algorithms.

Biased by a nano-ampere current reference circuit, the PTAT voltage generator is realized by an asymmetrical differential cell with two additional cross-coupled nMOS/pMOS pairs, which enhance the slope of the PTAT voltage remarkably. As a result, only two cascaded PTAT stages are used to compensate the complementary-to-absolute-temperature voltage generated directly by a diode-connected nMOS in the current reference circuit. Therefore, much power and chip area can be saved. A trimming circuit is also adopted to compensate the process-related reference voltage variations. The experimental results of the proposed reference circuit fabricated in a 0.18-\u03bc m standard CMOS process demonstrate that the circuit could operate under a minimum supply voltage of 1 V, and generate a reference voltage of 756 mV with temperature coefficient of 74 and 49.6 ppm/\u00b0C under 1-V and 1.8-V power supply, respectively.

To achieve high cross-range resolution within a short coherent processing interval (CPI), we divide the ISAR imaging process into multiple stages, each of which can be regarded as sparse-coding processing, and the encoding and decoding matrices can be obtained by solving an optimization problem using the error backpropagation algorithm. The decoding matrix can be regarded as a sparse dictionary, and we can recover the ISAR image by exploiting the smoothed ${l_0}$ norm algorithm based on the decoding matrix and CS theory. The ISAR image is then transformed into a time-domain echo by the inverse fast Fourier transform, and the echo can be regarded as the input for the next stage. At each stage, the resolution is gradually improved until we obtain the expected high-resolution ISAR image. Thus, the signals' energy can be fully accumulated step by step, and we can obtain a less noise and focused ISAR image. Experimental results show that the proposed method can obtain higher quality ISAR images compared with other current techniques, and that it is an effective approach to ISAR imaging within a short CPI.","doi":"10.1109/TAES.2017.2649161","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/7/7905775/07820096.pdf","startPage":"26","endPage":"40","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAES.2017.2649161","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7905775","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sparse Coding-Inspired High-Resolution ISAR Imaging Using Multistage Compressive Sensing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7820096","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 January 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7820096/","displayDocTitle":"Sparse Coding-Inspired High-Resolution ISAR Imaging Using Multistage Compressive Sensing","volume":"53","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Feb. 2017","accessionNumber":"16823835","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7820096/","dateOfInsertion":"24 April 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61671350, 61072106 and 61271302"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001321","fundingName":"National Research Foundation"},{"fundingName":"Doctoral Program of Higher Education of China","grantNumber":"20130203110009"},{"fundingName":"National Basic Research Program (973 Program) of China","grantNumber":"2013CB329402"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sparse Coding-Inspired High-Resolution ISAR Imaging Using Multistage Compressive Sensing","sourcePdf":"taes-hou-2649161-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.093593S","chronDate":"Feb.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"7","isNumber":"7905775","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"7905775","articleId":"7820096","onlineDate":"17 January 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7820097,"authors":[{"name":"Carmine Clemente","affiliation":["University of Strathclyde, Glasgow, U.K."],"firstName":"Carmine","lastName":"Clemente","orcid":"0000-0002-6665-693X","id":"37399665900"},{"name":"Luca Pallotta","affiliation":["CNIT c/o Universit\u00e0 di Napoli, Napoli, Italy"],"firstName":"Luca","lastName":"Pallotta","id":"38243287800"},{"name":"Domenico Gaglione","affiliation":["University of Strathclyde, Glasgow, U.K."],"firstName":"Domenico","lastName":"Gaglione","id":"37085545284"},{"name":"Antonio De Maio","affiliation":["Universit\u00e0 di Napoli \u201cFederico II\u201d, Napoli, Italy"],"firstName":"Antonio","lastName":"De Maio","id":"37272858900"},{"name":"John J.

Such models are essential to ensure reliability of evaluating antenna characteristics, yet they are computationally expensive and, therefore, unsuitable for handling tasks that require multiple analyses, e.g., parametric optimization. The cost issue can be alleviated by using fast surrogate models. Conventional data-driven models are unsuitable for modeling of antenna characteristics if the number of geometry parameters exceeds a few. Here, a novel approach is proposed. It is based on restricting the region of surrogate model validity to a manifold spanned by a set of reference designs corresponding to antenna optimized for various operating frequencies and dielectric permittivity of the substrate material. By focusing the modeling process in the region containing designs that are close-to-optimum from the point of view of the aforementioned operating/material criteria, considerable savings can be achieved in terms of the number of the training samples necessary to set up a reliable surrogate. In the letter, a rigorous analytical formulation of the technique is provided along with a case study of a ring slot antenna. The results are validated through measurements of fabricated antenna prototypes.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Computational modeling","Manifolds","Permittivity","Substrates","Slot antennas","Optimization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["permittivity","slot antennas","substrates"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fabricated antenna prototype measurement","ring slot antenna","substrate material","dielectric permittivity","fast surrogate model","full-wave electromagnetic simulation model","contemporary antenna structure design","reduced-cost design-oriented constrained surrogate model"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Antenna optimization","constrained modeling","design optimization","electromagnetic (EM)-driven design","surrogate modeling"]}],"doi":"10.1109/LAWP.2017.2654304","publicationTitle":"IEEE Antennas and Wireless Propagation Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Antennas and Wireless Propagation Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/7727/7855842/07820098.pdf","startPage":"1618","endPage":"1621","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7855842","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LAWP.2017.2654304","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On Reduced-Cost Design-Oriented Constrained Surrogate Modeling of Antenna Structures","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7820098","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"On Reduced-Cost Design-Oriented Constrained Surrogate Modeling of Antenna Structures","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7820098/","volume":"16","publicationDate":"2017","htmlLink":"/document/7820098/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"16935051","dateOfInsertion":"12 June 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 January 2017","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001840","fundingName":"Icelandic Centre for Research (RANNIS)","grantNumber":"1502034051"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004281","fundingName":"National Science Centre of Poland","grantNumber":"2015/17/B/ST6/01857"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On Reduced-Cost Design-Oriented Constrained Surrogate Modeling of Antenna Structures","sourcePdf":"lawp-koziel-2654304-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.079707S","chronDate":"2017","xplore-pub-id":"7727","isNumber":"7855842","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7727","citationCount":"25","xplore-issue":"7855842","articleId":"7820098","onlineDate":"17 January 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":7820102,"authors":[{"name":"Tao Gui","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Kowloon, Hong Kong"],"bio":{"p":["Tao Gui received the B.S. degree from Xidian University, Xi'an,\n China, in 2011, and the M.Sc. degree from Jinan University, Guangzhou, China, in 2014.

For improving drawbacks of enzymatic glucose biosensor, graphene oxide (GO) was directly dropped on the IGZO sensing membrane to improve sensing area and magnetic beads (MBs) were combined with GOx by covalent bonding to enhance immobilization strength for GOx. In addition, the enzymatic glucose biosensor modified by GO and MBs was integrated with microfluidic framework in order to investigate sensing characteristics under the dynamic conditions.

We let each node caches M files from a library of size m \u2265 M. Each node in the network requests a file from the library independently at random, according to a popularity distribution, and is served by other nodes having the requested file in their local cache via (possibly) multihop transmissions. Under the classical \u201cprotocol model\u201d of wireless networks, we characterize the optimal per-node capacity scaling law for a broad class of heavy-tailed popularity distributions, including Zipf distributions with exponent less than one. In the parameter regime of interest, i.e., m=o(nM), we show that a decentralized random caching strategy with uniform probability over the library yields the optimal per-node capacity scaling of \u0398(\u221aM/m) for heavy-tailed popularity distributions. This scaling is constant with n , thus yielding throughput scalability with the network size. Furthermore, the multihop capacity scaling can be significantly better than for the case of single-hop caching networks, for which the per-node capacity is \u0398 (M/m). The multihop capacity scaling law can be further improved for a Zipf distribution with exponent larger than some threshold > 1, by using a decentralized random caching uniformly across a subset of most popular files in the library. Namely, ignoring a subset of less popular files (i.e., effectively reducing the size of the library) can significantly improve the throughput scaling while guaranteeing that all nodes will be served with high probability as n increases.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel7/18/7855839/07820112.pdf","startPage":"1662","endPage":"1676","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2017.2654341","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2017.2654341","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7855839","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7820112","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Wireless Multihop Device-to-Device Caching Networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Throughput","Libraries","Wireless communication","Ad hoc networks","Spread spectrum communication","Device-to-device communication","Protocols"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["probability","protocols","radio networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wireless multihop device-to-device caching network","multihop transmissions","protocol model","optimal per-node capacity scaling law","Zipf distributions","decentralized random caching strategy","heavy-tailed popularity distribution","throughput scalability","single-hop caching network","multihop capacity scaling law","uniform probability"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Caching","device-to-device networks","multihop transmission","scaling laws"]}],"chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/18/7855839/7820112-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7820112/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 January 2017","displayDocTitle":"Wireless Multihop Device-to-Device Caching Networks","volume":"63","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/7820112/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 2017","accessionNumber":"16669087","dateOfInsertion":"14 February 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003725","fundingName":"Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) funded by the Ministry of Education, Science and Technology","grantNumber":"NRF-2013R1A1A1064955"},{"fundingName":"Alexander von Humboldt Professorship"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"NSF","grantNumber":"1161801"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"NSF","grantNumber":"CCF-1423140"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","chorusFlag":"true","title":"Wireless Multihop Device-to-Device Caching Networks","sourcePdf":"tit-jeon-2654341-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.140037S","chronDate":"March  2017","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"7855839","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"41","xplore-issue":"7855839","articleId":"7820112","onlineDate":"17 January 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7820120,"authors":[{"name":"Jianxing Liu","affiliation":["Research Institute of Intelligent Control and Systems, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/9424/8000716/7820120/liu-2654323-small.gif","p":["Jianxing Liu received the B.S. degree in mechanical engineering in\n 2004, the M.E. degree in control science and engineering in 2010, both from Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin,\n China, and the Ph.D. degree in automation from the Technical University of Belfort-Montbeliard, Belfort, France, in\n 2014.","Since 2014, he has been with Harbin Institute of Technology, China.

In the filter design, the random link failures, which are caused possibly by missing measurements as well as by probabilistic communication failures, are considered to illustrate more realistic dynamical behaviors of sensor networks. In order to tackle the uncertainties existing in systems, interval type-2 (IT2) fuzzy approach is utilized to establish the model, wherein upper and lower membership functions together with weighting coefficients are employed to express the uncertainties. An distributed IT2 fuzzy filter model is constructed to estimate system states. Using the Lyapunov theory, sufficient conditions have been given to ensure that the filtering error system is mean-square asymptotically stable and satisfies the predefined average $ \\mathcal {H}_{\\infty }$ performance level.

If P = Bern(p) and Q = Bern(q) with p q, it reduces to the problem of finding a densely connected K-subgraph planted in a large Erd\u00f6s-R\u00e9nyi graph; if P = )V (\u03bc, 1) and Q = )V (0, 1) with \u03bc > 0, it corresponds to the problem of locating a K \u00d7 K principal submatrix of elevated means in a large Gaussian random matrix. We focus on two types of asymptotic recovery guarantees as n \u2192 \u221e: 1) weak recovery: expected number of classification errors is o(K) and 2) exact recovery: probability of classifying all indices correctly converges to one. Under mild assumptions on P and Q, and allowing the community size to scale sublinearly with n, we derive a set of sufficient conditions and a set of necessary conditions for recovery, which are asymptotically tight with sharp constants. The results hold, in particular, for the Gaussian case, and for the case of bounded log likelihood ratio, including the Bernoulli case whenever (p/q) and (1 - p)/(1 - q) are bounded away from zero and infinity. Previous work has shown that if weak recovery is achievable; then, exact recovery is achievable in linear additional time by a simple voting procedure. We provide a converse, showing the condition for the voting procedure to succeed is almost necessary for exact recovery.","chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/18/7976396/7820122-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7820122/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 January 2017","volume":"63","issue":"8","accessionNumber":"17026443","publicationDate":"Aug. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"12 July 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7820122/","isJournal":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Information Limits for Recovering a Hidden Community","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"ECCS 10-28464, IIS-1447879, CCF-1409106 and CCF-1527105"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100010443","fundingName":"Strategic Research Initiative on Big-Data Analytics of the College of Engineering at the University of Illinois, DOD ONR through the Simons Foundation","grantNumber":"N00014-14-1-0823 and 328025"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","chorusFlag":"true","title":"Information Limits for Recovering a Hidden Community","sourcePdf":"tit-hajek-2653804-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.115224S","chronDate":"Aug.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"7976396","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"7976396","articleId":"7820122","onlineDate":"17 January 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":7820123,"authors":[{"name":"Na Liu","affiliation":["Space Microwave Remote Sensing System Department, Institute of Electronics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China","University of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4609443/7830770/7820123/liu-2630048-small.gif","p":["Na Liu received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in applied mathematics both\n from Jilin University, Jilin, China, in 2010 and 2013, respectively.

However, the FBA may result in a seriously signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) loss or might even fail to reconstruct the spectrum if there is highly nonuniform sampling in azimuth. It is the general case because pulse repetition frequency (PRF) cannot be selected flexibly for spaceborne imaging system. In this paper, a new algorithm for processing highly nonuniform sampled SAR data to improve the SNR is presented. The proposed method is based on the operation of ambiguity-index screening (AIS) and the minimum mean square error (MMSE) criterion. It can be utilized to reconstruct the spectrum even in the presence of highly nonuniform sampling or coinciding sampling. The approach can significantly improve the SNR especially for the highly nonuniform sampling, and the azimuth ambiguity-to-signal ratio obtained by the proposed method is superior to the traditional one for a wide range of PRF. The proposed algorithm is validated by the simulated data and the real two-channel radar raw data acquired by C-band airborne SAR system with a bandwidth of 210 MHz, which is designed by the Department of Space Microwave Remote Sensing System, Institute of Electronics, Chinese Academy of Sciences.","doi":"10.1109/JSTARS.2016.2630048","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSTARS.2016.2630048","startPage":"617","endPage":"627","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel7/4609443/7830770/07820123.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7830770","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Modified Multichannel Reconstruction Method of SAR With Highly Nonuniform Spatial Sampling","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 January 2017","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2017","displayDocTitle":"Modified Multichannel Reconstruction Method of SAR With Highly Nonuniform Spatial Sampling","publicationDate":"Feb. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","volume":"10","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7820123/","accessionNumber":"16619780","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7820123/","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"National Natural Science Funds for Excellent Young Scholar","grantNumber":"61422113"},{"fundingName":"One Hundred Person Project of the Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"fundingName":"The Chinese National Ten Thousand Talent Program-Young Top-Notch Talent Program"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modified Multichannel Reconstruction Method of SAR With Highly Nonuniform Spatial Sampling","sourcePdf":"jstars-wang-2630048-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.081233S","chronDate":"Feb.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"4609443","isNumber":"7830770","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4609443","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"7830770","articleId":"7820123","onlineDate":"17 January 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":7820128,"authors":[{"name":"Tengda Ying","affiliation":["College of Communication Engineering, University of Chongqing, Chongqing, China"],"firstName":"Tengda","lastName":"Ying","orcid":"0000-0001-7033-0820","id":"37086120317"},{"name":"Wenjiang Feng","affiliation":["College of Communication Engineering, University of Chongqing, Chongqing, China"],"firstName":"Wenjiang","lastName":"Feng","id":"37715956800"},{"name":"Guoling Liu","affiliation":["College of Communication Engineering, University of Chongqing, Chongqing, China"],"firstName":"Guoling","lastName":"Liu","id":"37086050556"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-7798"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2558"},{"format":"CD","value":"2373-7891"}],"articleNumber":"7820128","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":262},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interference","MIMO","Precoding","Transmitters","Receiving antennas"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Degrees of freedom","MIMO X channel","alternating CSIT","interference regeneration","symbolic elimination"]}],"abstract":"In this letter, we consider the sum degrees of freedom (sum-DoFs) of the two-user multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) X channel with alternating channel state information (CSI) at the transmitters (CSIT), which implies that the CSI available to the transmitters is \n<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">distributed</i>\n.

Characterizing users to select an appropriate communication mode in F-RANs is critical for performance optimization. With evolutionary game theory, a dynamic mode selection is proposed for F-RANs, in which the competition among the groups of potential users' space is formulated as a dynamic evolutionary game, and the game is solved by an evolutionary equilibrium. Stochastic geometry tool is used to derive the proposals' payoff expressions for both fog access point and device-to-device users by considering node location, cache sizes, as well as the delay cost.

Ambient backscattering devices reflect RF signals emitted by existing or legacy communications systems, such as digital TV broadcasting, cellular, or Wi-Fi ones, which are designed for transporting information and are not intended for RF energy transfer. This paper deals with mathematical modeling and performance analysis of wireless broadband networks operating over fading channels with ambient backscatter devices. After introducing a detailed signal model of the relevant communication links, we study the influence of physical parameters on the capacity of both legacy and backscatter channels, by considering different receiver architectures. We analytically show that, under reasonable operative conditions, a legacy system-employing an orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) modulation scheme-can turn the RF interference arising from the backscatter process into a form of multipath diversity that can be exploited to increase its performance. Moreover, our analysis proves that a backscatter system-transmitting one symbol per OFDM symbol of the legacy system-can achieve satisfactory data rates over relatively short distances, especially when the intended recipient of the backscatter signal is co-located with the legacy transmitter, i.e., they are on the same device.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7820135/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 January 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2017","volume":"65","issue":"4","accessionNumber":"16808423","dateOfInsertion":"14 April 2017","publicationDate":"April 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7820135/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Modeling and Performance Analysis of Wireless Networks With Ambient Backscatter Devices","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modeling and Performance Analysis of Wireless Networks With Ambient Backscatter Devices","sourcePdf":"tcomm-verde-2654448-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.148581S","chronDate":"April  2017","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"7900485","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"109","xplore-issue":"7900485","articleId":"7820135","onlineDate":"17 January 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7820136,"authors":[{"name":"Arsalan Saljoghei","affiliation":["RINCE Institute, School of Electronics Engineering, Dublin City University, Dublin, Ireland"],"bio":{"p":["Authors\u2019 biographies not available at the time of publication."]},"firstName":"Arsalan","lastName":"Saljoghei","id":"37085374939"},{"name":"Fernando A.

In this paper, we analyze the performance of FBMC in upstream passive optical networks (PON), without the employment of inter optical network unit (inter-ONU) frequency guard bands. By using both experimental work and numerical simulations, the impact of relative time offsets on inter-ONU orthogonality is studied. Furthermore, numerical simulations are also used to study the impact of frequency offsets in such systems. Moreover, comparisons are drawn to orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM)-based upstream PONs. This paper experimentally demonstrates that imperfect time synchronization impacts all subcarriers in an OFDM system, while it affects only the immediately adjacent subcarriers in an FBMC system, which could be corrected for by the restoration of synchronicity between users. A simple feedback mechanism is experimentally demonstrated to automatically restore orthogonality and synchronization between users in order to validate the practical implementation of the scheme.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Experimental Comparison of FBMC and OFDM for Multiple Access Uplink PON","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","doi":"10.1109/JLT.2017.2654319","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/50/7905773/07820136.pdf","startPage":"1595","endPage":"1604","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JLT.2017.2654319","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7905773","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7820136","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7820136/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 January 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"May1, 1 2017","displayDocTitle":"Experimental Comparison of FBMC and OFDM for Multiple Access Uplink PON","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"35","issue":"9","htmlLink":"/document/7820136/","dateOfInsertion":"24 April 2017","publicationDate":"1 May1, 2017","accessionNumber":"16823519","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"HEA PRTLI 4 INSPIRE"},{"fundingName":"People Program (Marie Curie Actions)"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004963","fundingName":"European Union's Seventh Framework Program","grantNumber":"09/IN.1/I2653, 10/CE/I1853 and FP7/2007-2013/"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Experimental Comparison of FBMC and OFDM for Multiple Access Uplink PON","sourcePdf":"jlt-saljoghei-2654319-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.097187S","chronDate":"May1, 1 2017","xplore-pub-id":"50","isNumber":"7905773","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"7905773","articleId":"7820136","onlineDate":"17 January 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7820138,"authors":[{"name":"Benjamin J.

Quantifying the behavior and distribution of animals around marine renewable energy devices is crucial for understanding, predicting, and potentially mitigating any threats posed by these installations. The Flow and Benthic Ecology 4D (FLOWBEC) autonomous seabed platform integrated an Imagenex multibeam echosounder and a Simrad EK60 multifrequency echosounder to monitor marine life in a 120\u00b0 sector over ranges up to 50 m, seven to eight times per second. Established target detection algorithms fail within MRE sites, due to high levels of backscatter generated by the turbulent physical dynamics, limiting and biasing analysis to only periods of low current speed. This study presents novel algorithms to extract diving seabirds, fish, and fish schools from the intense backscatter caused by turbulent dynamics in flows of 4 m s\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">-1</sup>\n. Filtering, detection, and tracking using a modified nearest neighbor algorithm provide robust tracking of animal behavior using the multibeam echosounder. Independent multifrequency target detection is demonstrated using the EK60 with optimally calculated thresholds, scale-sensitive filters, morphological exclusion, and frequency-response characteristics. This provides sensitive and reliable detection throughout the entire water column and at all flow speeds. Dive profiles, depth preferences, predator-prey interactions, and fish schooling behavior can be analyzed, in conjunction with the hydrodynamic impacts of marine renewable energy devices. Coregistration of targets between the acoustic instruments increases the information available, providing quantitative measures including frequency response from the EK60, and target morphology and behavioral interactions from the multibeam echosounder. The analyses draw on deployments at a tidal energy site in Scotland to compare the presence and absence of renewable energy structures across a range of physical and trophic levels over complete spring-neap tidal cycles. These results can be used to inform how animals forage in these sites and whether individuals face collision risks. This quantitative information can de-risk the licensing process and, with a greater mechanistic understanding at demonstration scales, its predictive power could reduce the monitoring required at future arrays.","doi":"10.1109/JOE.2016.2637179","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Oceanic Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Oceanic Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel7/48/8063254/07820138.pdf","startPage":"948","endPage":"965","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8063254","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JOE.2016.2637179","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multisensor Acoustic Tracking of Fish and Seabird Behavior Around Tidal Turbine Structures in Scotland","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7820138","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2017","displayDocTitle":"Multisensor Acoustic Tracking of Fish and Seabird Behavior Around Tidal Turbine Structures in Scotland","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7820138/","isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"06 May 2019","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"17216627","htmlLink":"/document/7820138/","volume":"42","issue":"4","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 January 2017","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000270","fundingName":"Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000277","fundingName":"Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs (Defra)","grantNumber":"NE/J004308/1, NE/J004200/1 and NE/J004332/1"},{"fundingName":"NERC MREKEP Internship"},{"fundingName":"Innovate U.K. Knowledge Transfer Partnership with MeyGen Ltd.","grantNumber":"KTP009812"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Multisensor Acoustic Tracking of Fish and Seabird Behavior Around Tidal Turbine Structures in Scotland","sourcePdf":"joe-williamson-2637179-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.099052S","chronDate":"Oct.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"48","isNumber":"8063254","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"48","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"8063254","articleId":"7820138","onlineDate":"17 January 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-09-24"},{"_id":7820140,"authors":[{"name":"Ningxiao Sun","affiliation":["School of Optoelectronics, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/7859429/7820140/nsun-2646461-small.gif","p":["Ningxiao Sun received the B.S. degree in electronic engineering from the Beijing Institute of Technology, where he is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree with the School of Optoelectronics.

A key issue is to design an efficient resource management scheme for wireless service delivery between the train and the ground. In this paper, we first provide an overview of the existing resource management schemes and some unsolved challenges are identified. To address these challenges, a cross-layer optimization framework is developed for facilitating the design and optimization of dynamic resource management. Then, the resource management problem is formulated as a stochastic optimization problem, which jointly considers the quality-of-service requirements and dynamic characteristics of HSR wireless communications. The stochastic network optimization theory is applied to transform the intractable stochastic optimization problem into a tractable deterministic optimization problem, which can be further decomposed into two separate subproblems: admission control and resource allocation. A fully distributed admission control scheme is proposed for the admission control subproblem, and a cooperative distributed resource allocation scheme is developed for the mixed-integer resource allocation subproblem with guaranteed global optimality. Finally, a distributed dynamic resource management algorithm is proposed to solve the original stochastic optimization problem with high reliability and robustness against central node failure. The performance of the proposed algorithm is analyzed theoretically and further validated by numerical simulations under realistic conditions for HSR wireless communications.","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/7859429/07820140.pdf","startPage":"620","endPage":"632","publicationTitle":"IEEE

from images, typically used as a preprocessing step, has a wide range of applications such as dermatology diagnostics, human computer interaction designs, and etc. It is a challenging problem due to many factors such as variation in pigment melanin, uneven illumination, and differences in ethnicity geographics. Besides, age and gender introduce additional difficulties to the detection process. It is hard to determine whether a single pixel is skin or nonskin without considering the context. An efficient traditional hand-engineered skin color detection algorithm requires extensive work by domain experts. Recently, deep learning algorithms, especially convolutional neural networks (CNNs), have achieved great success in pixel-wise labeling tasks. However, CNN-based architectures are not sufficient for modeling the relationship between pixels and their neighbors. In this letter, we integrate recurrent neural networks (RNNs) layers into the fully convolutional neural networks (FCNs), and develop an end-to-end network for human skin detection. In particular, FCN layers capture generic local features, while RNN layers model the semantic contextual dependencies in images. Experimental results on the COMPAQ and ECU skin datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, where RNN layers enhance the discriminative power of skin detection in complex background situations.","chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/97/7837777/7820144-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7820144/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 January 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"24","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 2017","dateOfInsertion":"09 February 2017","accessionNumber":"16649596","htmlLink":"/document/7820144/","displayDocTitle":"Combining Convolutional and Recurrent Neural Networks for Human Skin Detection","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"1449860 and 13505210"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61103056 and 61528204"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004543","fundingName":"China Scholarship Council"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","chorusFlag":"true","title":"Combining Convolutional and Recurrent Neural Networks for Human Skin Detection","sourcePdf":"lsp-zuo-2654803-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.074115S","chronDate":"March  2017","xplore-pub-id":"97","isNumber":"7837777","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"97","citationCount":"60","xplore-issue":"7837777","articleId":"7820144","onlineDate":"17 January 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7820147,"authors":[{"name":"Yong Qiang Hei","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of ISN, Xidian University, Xi'an, China"],"bio":{"p":["Yongqiang Hei received the B.Sc. and Ph.D. degrees in\n telecommunication engineering from the Xidian University, Xi'an, China, in 2006 and 2010, respectively.

Recently MIMO space time coding technique has provided a potential solution to mitigate the MDL and hence started receiving considerable interests. In this paper, orthogonal space time block coding (OSTBC)-based MDM transmission system was investigated to test its efficiency in mitigating MDL. Considering the importance and necessity of channel estimation for coherent receivers and the paucity of literature on this subject, MMSE channel estimation process was introduced in the MDM system to test the robustness and efficiency of the OSTBC-MDM system in mitigating the MDL. Furthermore, an alternative linear decoding (LD) method was achieved by transferring the orthogonal characteristics of codes in OSTBC to the channel elements in MDM system. The LD method has the same performance as the optimal ML method, excepting that it only exhibits linear computational complexity, in terms of the number of modes and the size of constellations. Simulation results were provided to validate the efficiency and robustness of the proposed OSTBC-MDM system in mitigating the MDL in the presence of MMSE channel estimation.","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave

A channel is connected to multiple ranks, and each rank has multiple banks. This hierarchical structure facilitates creating parallelisms in DRAM. The current DRAM architecture supports bank-level parallelism; as many rows as banks can be moved simultaneously at bank-level. However, rank-level parallelism is not supported. For this reason, only one column can be accessed at a time, although each rank has its own data bus that can carry a column. Namely, current DRAM operations do not exploit the structural opportunity created by multiple ranks. We, therefore, propose a novel DRAM architecture supporting rank-level parallelism. Thereby, as many columns as ranks can be moved concurrently at rank-level. In this paper, we illustrate the rank-level parallelism and its benefit in DRAM operations.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7820157/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 January 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"July 1 2017","volume":"66","issue":"7","accessionNumber":"16931483","dateOfInsertion":"07 June 2017","publicationDate":"1 July 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7820157/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Rank-Level Parallelism in DRAM","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Basic Science Research Program"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100007431","fundingName":"NRF"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003621","fundingName":"Ministry of Science, ICT & Future Planning","grantNumber":"NRF-2014R1A2A1A05004316"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Rank-Level Parallelism in DRAM","sourcePdf":"tc-kim-2654339-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.065961S","chronDate":"July 1 2017","xplore-pub-id":"12","isNumber":"7942329","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7942329","articleId":"7820157","onlineDate":"17 January 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7820159,"authors":[{"name":"Yongwoo Lee","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Seoul National University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Yongwoo","lastName":"Lee","id":"37086127931"},{"name":"Young-Sik Kim","affiliation":["Department of Information and Communication Engineering, Chosun University, Gwangju, South Korea"],"firstName":"Young-Sik","lastName":"Kim","orcid":"0000-0001-6319-6109","id":"37085565535"},{"name":"Jong-Seon No","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Seoul National University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Jong-Seon","lastName":"No","id":"37266106800"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-7798"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2558"},{"format":"CD","value":"2373-7891"}],"articleNumber":"7820159","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":454},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Blogs","Elliptic curve cryptography","Generators","Error correction codes","Synchronization"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Code-based cryptosystem","cryptography","linear feedback shift register (LFSR)","random number generator","secret key cryptosystem"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7820159","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/4234/7921536/07820159.pdf","startPage":"971","endPage":"974","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LCOMM.2017.2654238","doi":"10.1109/LCOMM.2017.2654238","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7921536","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Ciphertext-Only Attack on Linear Feedback Shift Register-Based Esmaeili-Gulliver Cryptosystem","abstract":"Esmaeili and Gulliver recently proposed a secret key cryptosystem based on error-correcting codes in which a codeword modified by random insertions, deletions, and errors is used as a ciphertext.

However, satisfying the stringent QoS requirements is an open problem. QoS aware protocols for WSNs have gained recently considerable attention of the researchers. In this paper, we focus on the QoS satisfaction in WSNs, basics of QoS support in WSNs, and more importantly challenge, requirements of QoS at each layer. Furthermore, we review the QoS protocols and categorize the QoS aware protocols and elaborate their pros and cons. We also discuss the QoS parameters with respect to each protocol performance parameters. A survey and comprehensive discussion on the QoS aware protocols of WSNs are presented, including their strengths and limitations. Finally, we also survey some computational intelligence (CI) techniques and find the basic requirements of such techniques. Moreover, we study these CI techniques in the light of QoS management and tabulate the level of each CI technique for QoS management. The paper is concluded with open research issues.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7820167/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 January 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"2017","isOpenAccess":true,"dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","publicationDate":"2017","accessionNumber":"16720350","htmlLink":"/document/7820167/","isJournal":true,"volume":"5","isDynamicHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Quality of Service of Routing Protocols in Wireless Sensor Networks: A Review","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002486","fundingName":"Hankuk University of Foreign Studies research fund 2016"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Quality of Service of Routing Protocols in Wireless Sensor Networks: A Review","sourcePdf":"access-khan-2654356-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.14063S","chronDate":"2017","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"7859429","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"38","xplore-issue":"7859429","articleId":"7820167","onlineDate":"17 January 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7820169,"authors":[{"name":"Elaine Wong","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, The University of Melbourne, Australia"],"bio":{"p":["Authors\u2019 biographies not available at the time of publication."]},"firstName":"Elaine","lastName":"Wong","id":"37275054300"},{"name":"Maluge Pubudini Imali Dias","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, The University of Melbourne, Australia"],"bio":{"p":["Authors\u2019 biographies not available at the time of publication."]},"firstName":"Maluge","lastName":"Pubudini Imali Dias","id":"37086056466"},{"name":"Lihua Ruan","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, The University of Melbourne, Australia"],"bio":{"p":["Authors\u2019 biographies not available at the time of publication."]},"firstName":"Lihua","lastName":"Ruan","id":"37085862478"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0733-8724"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2213"}],"articleNumber":"7820169","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":71,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":953},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"Optical Society of America","url":"http://www.osa.org/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Society","url":"http://taes.msubmit.net/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Electron Devices Society","url":"http://www.ieee.org/eds/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Instrumentation and Measurement Society","url":"http://ewh.ieee.org/soc/im/imnew/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society","url":"http://mtt.org/index.html"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control Society","url":"http://www.ieee-uffc.org/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Photonics Society","url":"http://www.PhotonicsSociety.org"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7820169","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Internet","Optical fibers","Servers","Optical fiber LAN","Medical services"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["local area networks","resource allocation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["predictive resource allocation","tactile internet capable passive optical LAN","local area network","Tactile Internet","TI-DWBA","end-to-end latency","network configurations","traffic distributions","traffic proportions"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["End-to-end latency","passive optical LANs","predictive resource allocation","Tactile Internet","time and wavelength division multiplexing"]}],"abstract":"The Tactile Internet promises new applications and services that harness real-time human-machine interactions to revolutionize our everyday life. Its realization however, necessitates a complete rethink of the underlying communications infrastructure as these applications/services necessitate carrier-grade reliability, ultra-high security, and ultra-low latency (~1 ms). To meet stringent latency targets, control/steering servers are anticipated to be placed at a short distance of only a few kilometers to the tactile edge. Therefore, in addition to the significant on-going research in the wireless tactile edge, there is an urgent need to focus on the local area network (LAN) segment to support the vision of Tactile Internet. Rising to this challenge, we report on the first initiative in designing LANs to facilitate the converged delivery of latency-sensitive Tactile Internet traffic and bandwidth-intensive applications. Specifically, our solution combines the time and wavelength division multiplexing technology on a passive optical LAN, with a predictive resource allocation algorithm termed Tactile Internet capable dynamic wavelength and bandwidth allocation algorithm (TI-DWBA). TI-DWBA is designed to estimate the average bandwidth of Tactile Internet (TI) and non-TI traffic at each integrated optical network terminal/wireless access point (ONT/WAP), exploit prediction mechanisms at the central office to predict and allocate bandwidth and wavelengths to accumulated traffic at each ONT/WAP, dynamically vary the number of active wavelengths in the network such that network congestion is alleviated to satisfy end-to-end latency constraints.

In this paper, a Stackelberg game approach for ESM is proposed. First, according to feed-in-tariff of PV energy, a system model of ESM is introduced, which includes the profit model of microgrid operator (MGO) and the utility model of PV prosumers. Moreover, an hour-ahead optimal pricing model of ESM is proposed. The model is designed based on Stackelberg game, where the MGO acts as the leader and all participating prosumers are considered as the followers. With the proof of equilibrium and uniqueness of the Stackelberg equilibrium, the MGO is obligated to coordinate the sharing of PV energy with maximization of the own profit, while the prosumers are autonomous to maximize their utilities with demand response availability. Finally, a billing mechanism is designed to deal with the uncertainty of PV energy and load consumption. By using the collected data from realistic PV-roofed buildings, the effectiveness of the model is verified in terms of the profit of MGO, the utilities of prosumers, and the net energy of the microgrid.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7820171/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 January 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2017","volume":"13","issue":"3","accessionNumber":"16917896","dateOfInsertion":"05 June 2017","publicationDate":"June 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7820171/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Energy Sharing Management for Microgrids With PV Prosumers: A Stackelberg Game Approach","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"51577059"},{"fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities","grantNumber":"2015ZD02"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy Sharing Management for Microgrids With PV Prosumers: A Stackelberg Game Approach","sourcePdf":"tii-liu-2654302-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.135841S","chronDate":"June  2017","xplore-pub-id":"9424","isNumber":"7938534","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9424","citationCount":"146","xplore-issue":"7938534","articleId":"7820171","onlineDate":"17 January 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-23"},{"_id":7820172,"authors":[{"name":"Snehamoy Dhar","affiliation":["Siksha O Anusandhan University, Bhubaneswar, India"],"bio":{"p":["Snehamoy Dhar received the Ph.D. degree in photovoltaic system control and protection.

A multiterminal dc (MTDC) distribution network is an effective solution for present grid scenario, where local distribution is incorporated primarily by power electronics based dc loads. PV systems with auxiliary power sources and local loads are used for MTDC connection, especially when ac utility grid is integrated with it by voltage source converters. Pole to pole and pole to ground faults are basically considered as dc distribution network hazards. As PV is connected through dc cable, high resistive dc arc fault is also studied in present literature. The proposed PV system is considered with arc-fault circuit interrupters as backup protection and is used to detect arcing series fault. Fast acting dc switching is considered for proposed differential current-based unit protection. A discrete frame differential current solution is considered to classify the fault type by modified cumulative sum average approach. By calculating unknown dc cable resistance accurately by non-iterative Moore-Penrose pseudo inverse technique, the fault distance is calculated. TMS320C6713 DSP based test-bench is used for verification of the scheme.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fault Detection and Location of Photovoltaic Based DC Microgrid Using Differential Protection Strategy","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid","doi":"10.1109/TSG.2017.2654267","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid","pdfPath":"/iel7/5165411/8443168/07820172.pdf","startPage":"4303","endPage":"4312","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSG.2017.2654267","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8443168","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7820172","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7820172/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 January 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2018","displayDocTitle":"Fault Detection and Location of Photovoltaic Based DC Microgrid Using Differential Protection Strategy","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"9","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/7820172/","dateOfInsertion":"21 August 2018","publicationDate":"Sept. 2018","accessionNumber":"18042523","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fault Detection and Location of Photovoltaic Based DC Microgrid Using Differential Protection Strategy","sourcePdf":"tsg-dash-2654267-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.07413S","chronDate":"Sept.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"5165411","isNumber":"8443168","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5165411","citationCount":"63","xplore-issue":"8443168","articleId":"7820172","onlineDate":"17 January 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-22"},{"_id":7820173,"authors":[{"name":"Gerardo Escobar","affiliation":["Graduate School of Engineering, Universidad Autonoma de Yucatan, Merida, Mexico"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5165391/7953694/7820173/escob-2654965-small.gif","p":["Gerardo Escobar (M\u201902\u2013SM\u201908) received the Ph.D.\n degree (Hons.) from the University of Paris Sud XI, CNRS-LSS-SUPELEC, Paris, France, in 1999.

The proposed method belongs to the family of perturb and observe (P&O) methods as the photovoltaic (PV) voltage is intentionally perturbed to induce changes on the PV power. In consequence, the slope of the pv-characteristic curve can be detected, which reveals the MPP position. The perturbation is usually an increment with varying direction, which is used to update the next PV voltage reference. However, changes on irradiance (or temperature) may also cause changes on the PV power, which mix with the algorithm's intentional increment effect on the PV power. This combination of effects confuses the slope detection, which may entail a wrong decision on the next increment direction, and a considerable deviation from the MPP. The scheme presented here proposes the use of more samplings and an associated combination of increments directions before taking a decision. This additional information is used to separate the effect of irradiance (or temperature) changes from the algorithm's intentional perturbation effect. Thus, the proposed multisampling MPPT can provide effective MPP tracking despite of irradiance (or temperature) changes. The proposed scheme is experimentally tested and compared to the conventional P&O under irradiance changes.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7953694","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSTE.2017.2654965","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Sustainable Energy","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Sustainable Energy","pdfPath":"/iel7/5165391/7953694/07820173.pdf","startPage":"1096","endPage":"1105","doi":"10.1109/TSTE.2017.2654965","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multisampling Maximum Power Point Tracker (MS-MPPT) to Compensate Irradiance and Temperature Changes","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2017","displayDocTitle":"Multisampling Maximum Power Point Tracker (MS-MPPT) to Compensate Irradiance and Temperature Changes","volume":"8","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/7820173/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"July 2017","accessionNumber":"16969781","dateOfInsertion":"19 June 2017","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7820173/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 January 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001804","fundingName":"Canada Research Chairs","grantNumber":"950-230361"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003141","fundingName":"CONACyT Mexico","grantNumber":"223182 CB-2013-01"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multisampling Maximum Power Point Tracker (MS-MPPT) to Compensate Irradiance and Temperature Changes","sourcePdf":"tste-escobar-2654965-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.077171S","chronDate":"July  2017","xplore-pub-id":"5165391","isNumber":"7953694","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5165391","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"7953694","articleId":"7820173","onlineDate":"17 January 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":7820178,"authors":[{"name":"Sangwook Suh","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/7874223/7820178/suh-2654344-small.gif","p":["Sangwook Suh (S\u201906\u2013M\u201915) received the B.S. degree from Seoul National University, Seoul, South Korea, in 1998, the M.S. degree from New York University, New York, NY, USA, in 2005, and the Ph.D. degree from the Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA, in 2011, all in electrical engineering.

The complexity of optimum maximum-likelihood detection is often prohibitive, especially for large numbers of antennas and large alphabets. A suboptimal tree-search-based detector known as the K-best detector is an effective scheme that provides a flexible performance-complexity tradeoff. In this paper, we identify scalar list detection as a key building block of the K-best detector, and we propose an efficient low-complexity implementation of the scalar list detector for M-ary QAM using a slicing operation. Embedding the slicing list detector into the K-best framework leads to our proposed slicing K-best detector. Simulation results show that the proposed detector offers comparable performance to the conventional K-best detector, but with significantly reduced complexity when K is less than the QAM alphabet size M. Since the slicing list detection is performed at each visited node in the detection tree, the complexity reduction is especially significant when the number of antennas and the alphabet size are large, making the proposed detector a competitive option for high spectral-efficiency wireless systems.","chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/7693/7874223/7820178-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7820178/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 January 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2017","dateOfInsertion":"08 March 2017","publicationDate":"March 2017","accessionNumber":"16725087","htmlLink":"/document/7820178/","isJournal":true,"volume":"16","issue":"3","isDynamicHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Reduced-Complexity MIMO Detection via a Slicing Breadth-First Tree Search","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"CNS-1513884"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","chorusFlag":"true","title":"Reduced-Complexity MIMO Detection via a Slicing Breadth-First Tree Search","sourcePdf":"twc-suh-2654344-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.086485S","chronDate":"March  2017","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"7874223","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"7874223","articleId":"7820178","onlineDate":"17 January 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7820179,"authors":[{"name":"Seung Beop Lee","affiliation":["The Cho Chun Shik Graduate School for Green Transportation, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejeon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Seung Beop","lastName":"Lee","id":"37085436740"},{"name":"Changwoo Lee","affiliation":["The Cho Chun Shik Graduate School for Green Transportation, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejeon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Changwoo","lastName":"Lee","id":"37086098091"},{"name":"In Gwun Jang","affiliation":["The Cho Chun Shik Graduate School for Green Transportation, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejeon, South Korea"],"firstName":"In Gwun","lastName":"Jang","orcid":"0000-0002-5250-1208","id":"37085432645"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9464"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0069"}],"articleNumber":"7820179","dbTime":"15 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":673},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Magnetics Society","url":"http://www.ieeemagnetics.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7820179","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Layout","Optimization","Transmitters","Silicon","Erbium","Magnetic fields","Wireless communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["coils","electromagnetic fields","inductive power transmission","laser power transmission","optimisation","radiofrequency power transmission"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optimal coil determination","wireless power transfer system","smooth boundary representation","secondary physical coil mass","fixed grid representation","FG representation","electromagnetic field strength","SB representation","coil layout optimization"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Coil design","gradient-based optimization","SB representation","wireless power transfer (WPT)"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TMAG.2017.2654679","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","pdfPath":"/iel7/20/7934107/07820179.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMAG.2017.2654679","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7934107","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Precise Determination of the Optimal Coil for Wireless Power Transfer Systems Through Postprocessing in the Smooth Boundary Representation","abstract":"Recently, the layout optimization of the secondary coils for wireless power transfer systems has been developed using the fixed grid (FG) representation. Although this method can effectively and efficiently determine the optimized coil design under the given conditions, a distinct discrepancy exists between the evaluated coil mass (i.e., simulation data) and the physical coil mass (i.e., experiment data). In this paper, the FG-based coil layout optimization is revisited based on the smooth boundary (SB) representation in order to resolve the inherent drawbacks of the FG representation. Induced voltage, electromagnetic field strength, and coil mass, which have been previously derived in the FG representation, are reformulated in terms of design variables (i.e., a reference turn and relative turns in this paper) in the SB representation. Through the layout optimization, the optimized layouts of the secondary coil are determined in order to minimize the coil mass while satisfying the constraints for induced voltage and magnetic field strength; then, they are postprocessed in order to obtain a smooth, elaborate boundary. The experimental validation demonstrates that the proposed SB-based approach outperforms the previous FG-based method in terms of coil mass and boundary representation.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7820179/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 January 2017","volume":"53","issue":"6","accessionNumber":"16914253","externalId":"7201704","publicationDate":"June 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7820179/","dateOfInsertion":"25 May 2017","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Precise Determination of the Optimal Coil for Wireless Power Transfer Systems Through Postprocessing in the Smooth Boundary Representation","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003565","fundingName":"Ministry of Land Infrastructure and Transport"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Precise Determination of the Optimal Coil for Wireless Power Transfer Systems Through Postprocessing in the Smooth Boundary Representation","sourcePdf":"tmag-jang-2654679-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.045997S","chronDate":"June  2017","xplore-pub-id":"20","isNumber":"7934107","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"20","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"7934107","articleId":"7820179","onlineDate":"17 January 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":7820181,"authors":[{"name":"Yunfei Chen","affiliation":["School of Engineering, University of Warwick, Coventry, U.K."],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/8008868/7820181/chen-2654364-small.gif","p":["Yunfei\u00a0Chen (S\u201902\u2013M\u201906\u2013SM\u201910)\n received the B.E. and M.E. degrees in electronics engineering from Shanghai Jiaotong University, Shanghai, China, in\n 1998 and 2001, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical and computer engineering from the University of\n Alberta, Edmonton, AB, Canada, in 2006.","He is currently working as an Associate Professor with the University of Warwick, Coventry, U.K. His research\n interests include wireless communications, cognitive radios, wireless relaying, and energy harvesting."]},"firstName":"Yunfei","lastName":"Chen","id":"37281026600"},{"name":"Wei Feng","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/8008868/7820181/wei-2654364-small.gif","p":["Wei Feng (S\u201906\u2013M\u201910) received the B.S. and Ph.D.\n degrees (both with the highest honor) in electronic engineering from Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, in 2005 and\n 2010, respectively.","From 2010 to 2011, he served as a Project Director with the National Science and Technology Major Project Management\n Office, Tsinghua University.

Both time-switching and power-splitting strategies are considered. Numerical results show that the two schemes that perform channel estimation only at the destination have worst performances than the two schemes that perform channel estimation at both the relay and the destination. They also show that the bit error rate performances of all schemes are close to the perfect case when exact knowledge of the channel state information is available such that there is no channel estimation error in the demodulation. The assumption that the two schemes only perform channel estimation at the destination makes them simpler, as they do not require channel estimation at the relay or feed the channel estimate back to the destination.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2017.2654364","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8008868","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/25/8008868/07820181.pdf","endPage":"6886","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Pilot-Based Channel Estimation for AF Relaying Using Energy Harvesting","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2017.2654364","startPage":"6877","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7820181","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 January 2017","displayDocTitle":"Pilot-Based Channel Estimation for AF Relaying Using Energy Harvesting","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7820181/","dateOfInsertion":"11 August 2017","accessionNumber":"17135865","publicationDate":"Aug. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7820181/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"66","issue":"8","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Pilot-Based Channel Estimation for AF Relaying Using Energy Harvesting","sourcePdf":"tvt-chen-2654364-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.105158S","chronDate":"Aug.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"8008868","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"8008868","articleId":"7820181","onlineDate":"17 January 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7820183,"authors":[{"name":"Ming Yang","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Automation, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/8000711/7820183/yang-2654540-small.gif","p":["Ming Yang (M\u201914) received the B.S., M.S., and Ph.D. degrees in\n electrical engineering from the Harbin Institute of Technology (HIT), Harbin, China, in 2000, 2002, and 2007,\n respectively.","In 2004, he, as a Lecturer, joined the Department of Electrical Engineering, HIT, where he has been a Professor of\n electrical engineering since 2016.

The system adopts a hybrid-automatic-repeat-request of type I (HARQ-I) protocol, and each user has an average delay constraint to be satisfied under a total power constraint for the system. The contribution of this paper lies in several folds. 1) By introducing new constraints and new variables in the original problem, the solution is analytically obtained by the dual method. 2) An algorithm that jointly allocates for every user the optimal downlink power at base station and relay station (RS) and selects the RS (if cooperation is decided) is proposed. 3) Another binary integer programming algorithm that selects the optimal modulation and coding scheme (MCS) and optimizes the number of time-frequency resource blocks (RBs) between users is proposed. In order to corroborate our findings, simulation results in terms of energy-delay tradeoff, average starvation user rates, and selected MCS statistics are presented. Our analyses show that relay-assisted strategy improves up to 30% the energy consumption, compared to a nonrelay-assisted one.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular

The perpendicular anisotropy is locally reduced by shadowing effects during sputter deposition. A 3-D model based on experimental measurements of fabricated nanomagnets has been developed. Experimental data from atomic force microscopy measurements and anisotropy measurements of fabricated Co/Pt-nanomagnets allow to realistically model the anisotropy and geometry of the nanomagnets. Micromagnetic simulations based on the developed 3-D model have been performed. It is shown that increasing the undercut in the resist decreases the switching field of the nanomagnets. By varying the tip geometry of the nanomagnet, the switching field can be further decreased, and subsequently, the nucleation point can be controlled, making this technique feasible for the use in perpendicular nanomagnetic logic circuitry.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Engineering the Switching Behavior of Nanomagnets for Logic Computation Using 3-D Modeling and Simulation","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","doi":"10.1109/TMAG.2017.2654969","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","pdfPath":"/iel7/20/7934107/07820187.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMAG.2017.2654969","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7934107","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7820187","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7820187/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 January 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2017","displayDocTitle":"Engineering the Switching Behavior of Nanomagnets for Logic Computation Using 3-D Modeling and Simulation","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"53","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/7820187/","dateOfInsertion":"25 May 2017","externalId":"3400304","publicationDate":"June 2017","accessionNumber":"16914107","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Engineering the Switching Behavior of Nanomagnets for Logic Computation Using 3-D Modeling and Simulation","sourcePdf":"tmag-kaiser-2654969-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.049628S","chronDate":"June  2017","xplore-pub-id":"20","isNumber":"7934107","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"20","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7934107","articleId":"7820187","onlineDate":"17 January 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7820188,"authors":[{"name":"Xiliang Luo","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Technology, ShanghaiTech University, Shanghai, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/7874223/7820188/luo-2654458-small.gif","p":["Xiliang Luo (S\u201903\u2013M\u201906) received the B.Sc. degree in physics from Peking University, Beijing, China, in 2001, and the M.Sc. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from the University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, USA, in 2003 and 2006, respectively.","After finishing his Ph.D. studies, he joined Qualcomm Research and carried out cutting edge research at different posts as a Senior Engineer (2006), a Staff Engineer (2010), and then a Senior Staff Engineer (2013), where he was involved in the system designs, analyses, and standardization of 4G LTE.

Due to the unplanned nature, HetNets are very irregular and severe interference can happen without judicious designs of the user association rules. Most prior works assumed best-effort traffic and sought the optimal association to maximize metrics, such as the sum of log-rates. In the case of bursty traffic with quality-of-service (QoS) requirements, existing association schemes cannot fully release the traffic offloading capabilities of HetNets. In this paper, we model the downlink traffic to individual mobile station explicitly. Aiming to minimize the network-wide packet delay, we investigate the optimal user association scheme and the corresponding resource allocation algorithm. We then propose the QoS-aware user association (QoSA) strategies of different flavors enjoying low complexity and guaranteed convergence. Furthermore, the proposed QoSA algorithms are readily implemented in distributed manners. Extensive network simulations are carried out to corroborate our designs.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2017.2654458","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7693/7874223/07820188.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2017.2654458","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7874223","startPage":"1809","endPage":"1822","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Delay-Oriented QoS-Aware User Association and Resource Allocation in Heterogeneous Cellular Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7820188","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Delay-Oriented QoS-Aware User Association and Resource Allocation in Heterogeneous Cellular Networks","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7820188/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 January 2017","isJournal":true,"volume":"16","issue":"3","publicationDate":"March 2017","accessionNumber":"16725098","dateOfInsertion":"08 March 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7820188/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"ShanghaiTech University","grantNumber":"F-0203-14-008"},{"fundingName":"Research Collaboration Fund from Spreadtrum Communications Inc"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Delay-Oriented QoS-Aware User Association and Resource Allocation in Heterogeneous Cellular Networks","sourcePdf":"twc-luo-2654458-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.139258S","chronDate":"March  2017","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"7874223","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"24","xplore-issue":"7874223","articleId":"7820188","onlineDate":"17 January 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7820190,"authors":[{"name":"Xi Li","affiliation":["Alibaba-Zhejiang University Joint Institute of Frontier Technologies, Hangzhou, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/69/8002781/7820190/li-2654250-small.gif","p":["Xi Li received the PhD degree from the National Laboratory of Pattern\n Recognition, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China, in 2009.

Standardly, the two key issues of learning to rank, feature mappings and score functions, are usually modeled separately, and the learning is usually restricted to modeling a linear distance function such as the Mahalanobis distance. However, the modeling of feature mappings and score functions are mutually interacted, and the patterns underlying the data are probably complicated and nonlinear. Thus, as a general nonlinear distance family, the Bregman distance is a suitable distance function for learning to rank, due to its strong generalization ability for distance functions, and its nonlinearity for exploring the general patterns of data distributions. In this paper, we study learning to rank as a structural learning problem, and devise a Bregman distance function to build the ranking model based on structural SVM. To improve the model robustness to outliers, we develop a robust structural learning framework for the ranking model. The proposed model Robust Structural Bregman distance functions Learning to Rank (RSBLR) is a general and unified framework for learning distance functions to rank. The experiments of data ranking on real-world datasets show the superiority of this method to the state-of-the-art literature, as well as its robustness to the noisily labeled outliers.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Robustness","Support vector machines","Data models","Semantics","Training","Measurement","Analytical models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["content-based retrieval","geometry","learning (artificial intelligence)","pattern classification","support vector machines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["robust structural Bregman distance functions learning to rank","RSBLR","content-based learning to rank","feature mappings","score functions","data distributions patterns","structural SVM","structural learning framework","ranking model"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Learning to rank","Bregman distance","structural SVM","robust structural learning"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TKDE.2017.2654250","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel7/69/8002781/07820190.pdf","startPage":"1916","endPage":"1927","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8002781","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TKDE.2017.2654250","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Learning Bregman Distance Functions for Structural Learning to Rank","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7820190","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Learning Bregman Distance Functions for Structural Learning to Rank","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7820190/","volume":"29","issue":"9","publicationDate":"1 Sept. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7820190/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"17132612","dateOfInsertion":"04 August 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 1 2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 January 2017","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"U1509206, 61472353 and 61672456"},{"fundingName":"National Basic Research Program of China","grantNumber":"2012CB316400 and 2015CB352302"},{"fundingName":"Alibaba-Zhejiang University Joint Institute of Frontier Technologies"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Learning Bregman Distance Functions for Structural Learning to Rank","sourcePdf":"tkde-li-2654250-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.177614S","chronDate":"Sept. 1 2017","xplore-pub-id":"69","isNumber":"8002781","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"69","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"8002781","articleId":"7820190","onlineDate":"17 January 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":7820193,"authors":[{"name":"Yinliang Xu","affiliation":["SYSU-CMU Joint Institute of Engineering, School of Electronics and Information Technology, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5165411/8443168/7820193/xu-2654253-small.gif","p":["Yinliang Xu (M\u201913) received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in control science and engineering from the Harbin Institute of Technology, China, in 2007 and 2009, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical and computer engineering from New Mexico State University, Las Cruces, NM, USA, in 2013.","From 2013 to 2014, he was a Visiting Scholar with the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA, USA.

The timely and accurate transmission of a huge quantity of data poses great challenge to the communication network. This paper proposes a novel real-time compressive sensing based strategy for the load frequency control of a multi-area interconnected power system. According to the proposed strategy, the measured data in each control area is compressed before being transmitted through the communication network, and then recovered accurately by the discrete central controller. The proposed strategy can significantly reduce the size of transmitted data and improve the reliability of the communication network by introducing model predictive control method.

More recently, our work has shown that it is possible to detect technical debt using source code comments (i.e., self-admitted technical debt), and that the most common types of self-admitted technical debt are design and requirement debt. However, all approaches thus far heavily depend on the manual classification of source code comments. In this paper, we present an approach to automatically identify design and requirement self-admitted technical debt using Natural Language Processing (NLP). We study 10 open source projects: Ant, ArgoUML, Columba, EMF, Hibernate, JEdit, JFreeChart, JMeter, JRuby and SQuirrel SQL and find that 1) we are able to accurately identify self-admitted technical debt, significantly outperforming the current state-of-the-art based on fixed keywords and phrases; 2) words related to sloppy code or mediocre source code quality are the best indicators of design debt, whereas words related to the need to complete a partially implemented requirement in the future are the best indicators of requirement debt; and 3) we can achieve 90 percent of the best classification performance, using as little as 23 percent of the comments for both design and requirement self-admitted technical debt, and 80 percent of the best performance, using as little as 9 and 5 percent of the comments for design and requirement self-admitted technical debt, respectively. The last finding shows that the proposed approach can achieve a good accuracy even with a relatively small training dataset.","doi":"10.1109/TSE.2017.2654244","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel7/32/8103872/07820211.pdf","startPage":"1044","endPage":"1062","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8103872","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSE.2017.2654244","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Using Natural Language Processing to Automatically Detect Self-Admitted Technical Debt","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 January 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7820211/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov. 1 2017","displayDocTitle":"Using Natural Language Processing to Automatically Detect Self-Admitted Technical Debt","htmlLink":"/document/7820211/","dateOfInsertion":"10 November 2017","publicationDate":"1 Nov. 2017","accessionNumber":"17372908","isJournal":true,"volume":"43","issue":"11","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000038","fundingName":"Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Using Natural Language Processing to Automatically Detect Self-Admitted Technical Debt","sourcePdf":"tse-shihab-2654244-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.17212S","chronDate":"Nov. 1 2017","xplore-pub-id":"32","isNumber":"8103872","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"32","citationCount":"32","xplore-issue":"8103872","articleId":"7820211","onlineDate":"17 January 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7820212,"authors":[{"name":"Ming-Chun Lee","affiliation":["Research Center for Information Technology Innovation, Academia Sinica, Taipei, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/7894295/7820212/lee-2654348-small.gif","p":["Ming-Chun Lee received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in electrical and computer engineering from National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan, in 2012 and 2014, respectively.

We consider the system equipped with a single radio frequency chain and a phase shift network. Our proposed designs can attain benefits of both beamforming and spatial modulation, and therefore enable the significant signal-to-noise power ratio enhancement with efficient degrees of freedom utilization and low cost. We elaborate APAVSM and formulate the multimode hybrid precoder design problem. To solve the problem, we impose restrictions on the number of candidate modes for selection, and propose the hybrid precoder design approach in which two non-convex max-min problems are solved sequentially by iterative approaches. To trade off between error rate and complexity, we propose alternative designs by reducing the dimensionality and/or relaxing constraints. Moreover, by the concept of beamspace, heuristic algorithms are proposed with extremely low complexities. We offer complexity analyses for proposed design approaches. Simulations in Ralyigh fading and millimeter-wave (mmWave) channels are used to evaluate the proposed designs. Results show that our designs can outperform the existing SM-MIMO systems, and provide the feasible operation in mmWave channels with severe path loss. Moreover, the superiority of proposed designs to the conventional precoding-aided MIMO systems is numerically demonstrated.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2017.2654348","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7894295","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2017.2654348","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7693/7894295/07820212.pdf","startPage":"2139","endPage":"2152","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive Multimode Hybrid Precoding for Single-RF Virtual Space Modulation With Analog Phase Shift Network in MIMO Systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 January 2017","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive Multimode Hybrid Precoding for Single-RF Virtual Space Modulation With Analog Phase Shift Network in MIMO Systems","volume":"16","issue":"4","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2017","dateOfInsertion":"07 April 2017","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7820212/","publicationDate":"April 2017","accessionNumber":"16807562","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7820212/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004663","fundingName":"Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan","grantNumber":"MOST 105-2221-E-001-009-MY3 and 104-2221-E-001-008-MY3"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001869","fundingName":"Academia Sinica Thematic Project","grantNumber":"AS-104-TP-A05"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive Multimode Hybrid Precoding for Single-RF Virtual Space Modulation With Analog Phase Shift Network in MIMO Systems","sourcePdf":"twc-chung-2654348-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.180382S","chronDate":"April  2017","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"7894295","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"7894295","articleId":"7820212","onlineDate":"17 January 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7820220,"authors":[{"name":"Yipeng Song","affiliation":["Energy Technology, Aalborg Universitet, Aalborg, Denmark"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/8000711/7820220/song-2654919-small.gif","p":["Yipeng Song (M\u201916) was born in Hangzhou, China.

The principle and frequency of HFR have been discussed using the Bode diagram as an analysis tool. However, the HFR can be categorized into two different types: undamped HFR (which exists in steady state) and unstable HFR (which eventually results in complete instability and divergence), both of them are not investigated before. Since both the undamped HFR and unstable HFR are critical to the output wind power quality as well as the safe and reliable operation of the DFIG system, it is meaningful to discuss them using the Nyquist criterion from two perspectives: 1) determining either the undamped HFR or the unstable HFR occurs; and 2) estimating the amplitude of the undamped HFR. The influence factors, including the weak network shunt capacitance and the current PI controller parameters, are discussed when estimating the amplitude of the undamped HFR. The experimental and simulation results of a 7.5 kW down-scaled DFIG setup are provided to validate the analysis of the undamped HFR and unstable HFR.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7820220/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 January 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7820220/","dateOfInsertion":"03 August 2017","publicationDate":"Dec. 2017","accessionNumber":"17081481","volume":"32","issue":"12","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Analysis of the Behavior of Undamped and Unstable High-Frequency Resonance in a DFIG System","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis of the Behavior of Undamped and Unstable High-Frequency Resonance in a DFIG System","sourcePdf":"tpel-song-2654919-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.074307S","chronDate":"Dec.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"8000711","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"8000711","articleId":"7820220","onlineDate":"17 January 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":7820225,"authors":[{"name":"Jiaqing Liang","affiliation":["Shanghai Key Laboratory of Data Science, Fudan University, Shanghai Shi, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/69/7914802/7820225/liang-2653115-small.gif","p":["Jiaqing Liang received the BS degree from the School of Computer\n Science, Fudan University, China, in 2015.

To enable this functionality, mm-wave (EHF) and Terahertz (THF) bands are being actively explored. These bands are characterized by unique propagation properties compared with microwave systems. As a result, the interference structure in these systems could be principally different to what we observed so far at lower frequencies. In this paper, using the tools of stochastic geometry, we study the systems operating in the EHF/THF bands by explicitly capturing three phenomena inherent for these frequencies: (1) high directivity of the transmit and receive antennas;( 2) molecular absorption; and (3) blocking of high-frequency radiation. We also define and compare two different antenna radiation pattern models. The metrics of interest are the mean interference and the signal-to-interference-plus-noise (SINR) ratio at the receiver. Our results reveal that: (1) for the same total emitted energy by a Poisson field of interferers, both the interference and SINR significantly increase when simultaneously both transmit and receive antennas are directive and (2) blocking has a profound impact on the interference and SINR creating much more favorable conditions for communications compared with no blocking case.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2017.2654351","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7693/7874223/07820226.pdf","startPage":"1791","endPage":"1808","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2017.2654351","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7874223","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Interference and SINR in Millimeter Wave and Terahertz Communication Systems With Blocking and Directional Antennas","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 January 2017","displayDocTitle":"Interference and SINR in Millimeter Wave and Terahertz Communication Systems With Blocking and Directional Antennas","volume":"16","issue":"3","dateOfInsertion":"08 March 2017","accessionNumber":"16725062","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7820226/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7820226/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2017","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Academy of Finland FiDiPro Program Nanocommunication Networks 2012\u20132016"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100006602","fundingName":"AFRL","grantNumber":"FA8750-15-1-0050"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004181","fundingName":"Nokia Foundation"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Interference and SINR in Millimeter Wave and Terahertz Communication Systems With Blocking and Directional Antennas","sourcePdf":"twc-petrov-2654351-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.118425S","chronDate":"March  2017","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"7874223","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"99","xplore-issue":"7874223","articleId":"7820226","onlineDate":"17 January 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-22"},{"_id":7820266,"authors":[{"name":"Mengsong Zou","affiliation":["Rutgers Discovery Informatics Institute, Rutgers University, USA"],"firstName":"Mengsong","lastName":"Zou","id":"37085377966"},{"name":"Javier Diaz-Montes","affiliation":["Rutgers Discovery Informatics Institute, Rutgers University, USA"],"firstName":"Javier","lastName":"Diaz-Montes","id":"37085372815"},{"name":"Kiran Nagaraja","affiliation":["Ericsson, USA"],"firstName":"Kiran","lastName":"Nagaraja","id":"37265322800"},{"name":"Nimish Radia","affiliation":["Ericsson, USA"],"firstName":"Nimish","lastName":"Radia","id":"38068139600"},{"name":"Manish Parashar","affiliation":["Rutgers Discovery Informatics Institute, Rutgers University, USA"],"firstName":"Manish","lastName":"Parashar","id":"37269279100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2619-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2620-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2159-6190"}],"articleNumber":"7820266","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":159},"keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["D3W","distributed data-driven workflows","decentralized workflow management approach","QoS levels","cost models","live media stream application"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Multi-Cloud","Multimedia Streaming","Distributed Workflows"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7820266","doi":"10.1109/CLOUD.2016.0029","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CLOUD.2016.0029","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7820017","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE 9th International Conference on Cloud Computing (CLOUD)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE 9th International Conference on Cloud Computing (CLOUD)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7819578/7820017/07820266.pdf","startPage":"148","endPage":"155","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"D3W: Towards Self-Management of Distributed Data-Driven Workflows with QoS Guarantees","abstract":"Data-driven application workflows that leverage compute capabilities and hosted services near the network edge can support latency-sensitive and critical applications in emerging areas such as Internet of Things (IoT) and smart infrastructure. However, distributed instantiation and execution of these workflows using resources across service providers and datacenters can be challenging. In this paper, we present the formulation of a decentralized workflow management approach for the autonomous instantiation and execution of dynamic data-driven workflows based on the opportunistic discovery and composition of services on-demand. Given a workflow template specification, this approach allows us to decouple workflow stages, allowing the execution of different stages to be performed by individual services, which are discovered and instantiated dynamically, and can be independently scaled as needed. These services may be geographically distributed and may be offered by different service providers using various QoS levels and cost models. The design, implementation and experimental evaluation of a decentralized workflow management framework using a live media stream application in a multi-cloud infrastructure is presented. Evaluations using a sample topology shows up to 2.5 times increase in QoS-meeting throughput when using our dynamic multi-cloud approach instead of using a fixed centralized cloud of identical capacity.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7820266/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 27 2016-July 2 2016","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"27 June-2 July 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7820266/","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2017","publicationDate":"June 2016","accessionNumber":"16617429","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"D3W: Towards Self-Management of Distributed Data-Driven Workflows with QoS Guarantees","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"D3W: Towards Self-Management of Distributed Data-Driven Workflows with QoS Guarantees","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"2619a148.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071945S","chronDate":"June 27 2016-July 2 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7819578","isNumber":"7820017","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7819578","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7820017","articleId":"7820266","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":7820285,"authors":[{"name":"Salvador DeCelles","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, Drexel University, Philadelphia, PA"],"firstName":"Salvador","lastName":"DeCelles","id":"38542148500"},{"name":"Tingshan Huang","affiliation":["Drexel University, Philadelphia, PA, US"],"firstName":"Tingshan","lastName":"Huang","id":"38247451900"},{"name":"Matthew C.

Using case studies involving long-running enterprise benchmark applications, Trade6 and RuBBoS, with injected memory leaks, we show that the performance of the PCA-based detector when using just the compressed data is almost equivalent to the case in which the raw data is completely available, but achieved using significantly fewer samples with a compression rate exceeding 75%.","doi":"10.1109/CLOUD.2016.0048","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CLOUD.2016.0048","startPage":"303","endPage":"310","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE 9th International Conference on Cloud Computing (CLOUD)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7819578/7820017/07820285.pdf","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE 9th International Conference on Cloud Computing (CLOUD)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7820017","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Detecting Incipient Faults in Software Systems: A Compressed Sampling-Based Approach","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"June 27 2016-July 2 2016","displayDocTitle":"Detecting Incipient Faults in Software Systems: A Compressed Sampling-Based Approach","conferenceDate":"27 June-2 July 2016","publicationDate":"June 2016","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2017","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7820285/","accessionNumber":"16617459","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7820285/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Detecting Incipient Faults in Software Systems: A Compressed Sampling-Based Approach","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"2619a303.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06729S","chronDate":"June 27 2016-July 2 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7819578","isNumber":"7820017","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7819578","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7820017","articleId":"7820285","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-20"},{"_id":7820289,"authors":[{"name":"Daniel J.

Efficient scheduling approaches can minimize the operational cost of Cloud providers and provide higher guarantee of the quality of services (QoS) for Cloud consumers. However, most of the existing workflow scheduling approaches are designed for the individual workflow runtime environments that are deterministic. Such static workflow schedulers are inadequate for multiple and dynamic workflows, each with possibly uncertain task execution time. In this paper, we address the problem of minimizing uncertainty propagation in real-time workflow scheduling. We first introduce an uncertainty-aware scheduling architecture to mitigate the impact of uncertainty factors on the quality of workflow schedules. Then we present a dynamic workflow scheduling algorithm (PRS) that can dynamically exploit proactive and reactive scheduling methods. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments using real-world workflow traces and our experimental results show that PRS outperforms two representative scheduling algorithms in terms of costs (up to 60%), resource utilization (up to 40%) and deviation (up to 70%).","doi":"10.1109/CLOUD.2016.0082","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE 9th International Conference on Cloud Computing (CLOUD)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE 9th International Conference on Cloud Computing (CLOUD)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7819578/7820017/07820319.pdf","startPage":"577","endPage":"584","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CLOUD.2016.0082","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7820017","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Uncertainty-Aware Real-Time Workflow Scheduling in the Cloud","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7820319","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 27 2016-July 2 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7820319/","displayDocTitle":"Uncertainty-Aware Real-Time Workflow Scheduling in the Cloud","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2016","accessionNumber":"16617428","htmlLink":"/document/7820319/","conferenceDate":"27 June-2 July 2016","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Uncertainty-Aware Real-Time Workflow Scheduling in the Cloud","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"2619a577.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.101085S","chronDate":"June 27 2016-July 2 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7819578","isNumber":"7820017","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7819578","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"7820017","articleId":"7820319","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7820324,"authors":[{"name":"Syed Noorulhassan Shirazi","affiliation":["InfoLab21, Lancaster University, UK"],"firstName":"Syed Noorulhassan","lastName":"Shirazi","id":"37085812214"},{"name":"Steven Simpson","affiliation":["InfoLab21, Lancaster University, UK"],"firstName":"Steven","lastName":"Simpson","id":"37604910500"},{"name":"Antonios Gouglidis","affiliation":["InfoLab21, Lancaster University, UK"],"firstName":"Antonios","lastName":"Gouglidis","id":"38111145900"},{"name":"Andreas Mauthe","affiliation":["InfoLab21, Lancaster University, UK"],"firstName":"Andreas","lastName":"Mauthe","id":"37267059000"},{"name":"David Hutchison","affiliation":["InfoLab21, Lancaster University, UK"],"firstName":"David","lastName":"Hutchison","id":"37267966800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2619-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2620-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2159-6190"}],"articleNumber":"7820324","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":343},"abstract":"Cloud computing is now extremely popular because of its use of elastic resources to provide optimized, cost-effective and on-demand services. However, clouds may be subject to challenges arising from cyber attacks including DoS and malware, as well as from sheer complexity problems that manifest themselves as anomalies. Anomaly detection techniques are used increasingly to improve the resilience of cloud environments and indirectly reduce the cost of recovery from outages. Most anomaly detection techniques are computationally expensive in a cloud context, and often require problem-specific parameters to be predefined in advance, impairing their use in real-time detection. Aiming to overcome these problems, we propose a technique for anomaly detection based on data density. The density is computed recursively, so the technique is memory-less and unsupervised, and therefore suitable for real-time cloud environments. We demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed technique on a dataset created in our cloud testbed. The dataset consists of feature vectors obtained from a physical cloud testbed network experiencing migration under controlled traffic conditions modelling scenarios combining normal network use with network-based attacks. The obtained results, which include precision, recall, accuracy, F-score and G-score, show that network level attacks are detectable with high accuracy.","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE 9th International Conference on Cloud Computing (CLOUD)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7819578/7820017/07820324.pdf","startPage":"616","endPage":"623","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE 9th International Conference on Cloud Computing (CLOUD)","doi":"10.1109/CLOUD.2016.0087","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CLOUD.2016.0087","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7820017","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7820324","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Anomaly Detection in the Cloud Using Data Density","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cloud computing","Real-time systems","Measurement","Context","Scalability","Entropy","Detectors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","computational complexity","security of data"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data density","anomaly detection","cloud computing","cyber attacks","DoS","malware","sheer complexity problems","network-based attacks"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cloud security","anomaly detection"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7820324/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 27 2016-July 2 2016","displayDocTitle":"Anomaly Detection in the Cloud Using Data Density","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7820324/","publicationDate":"June 2016","accessionNumber":"16617448","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2017","conferenceDate":"27 June-2 July 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Anomaly Detection in the Cloud Using Data Density","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"2619a616.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.099908S","chronDate":"June 27 2016-July 2 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7819578","isNumber":"7820017","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7819578","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"7820017","articleId":"7820324","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7820329,"authors":[{"name":"Shinya Tashiro","affiliation":["Graduate School of Information Science and Technology, Osaka University, Osaka, Japan"],"firstName":"Shinya","lastName":"Tashiro","id":"37085655248"},{"name":"Yutaka Nakamura","affiliation":["Graduate School of Engineering Science, Osaka University, Osaka, Japan"],"firstName":"Yutaka","lastName":"Nakamura","id":"37423365200"},{"name":"Kazuhiro Matsuda","affiliation":["NTT Advanced Technology Corporation, Kanagawa, Japan"],"firstName":"Kazuhiro","lastName":"Matsuda","id":"37085481577"},{"name":"Morito Matsuoka","affiliation":["Cybermedia Center, Osaka University, Osaka, Japan","Advanced Telecommunications Research Institute International, Kyoto, Japan"],"firstName":"Morito","lastName":"Matsuoka","id":"37085499771"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2619-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2620-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2159-6190"}],"articleNumber":"7820329","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":880},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Servers","Temperature distribution","Power demand","Temperature sensors","Data models","Predictive models","Atmospheric modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer centres","convolution","mean square error methods","neural nets","temperature distribution"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["convolutional neural network","temperature distribution prediction","data centers","CNN","equipment locations","server types","physical relations","local structure learning","root mean square error","RMSE","linear prediction models","air conditioners"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Data center","Power consumption reduction","Temperature prediction","Convolutional neural network"]}],"abstract":"We propose a model for predicting the temperature distribution in data centers by using a convolutional neural network (CNN).

We evaluate the performance of the proposed model by using actual data from an experimental data center. The evaluation indicates that the proposed model can predict 20-minute future temperature distributions over 48 locations in 0.42 ms, with a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.96 degrees.

Frequent addition and removal of Virtual Machines (VMs) can cause load imbalance across Host Machines (HMs). Therefore, redistribution of VMs to different HMs needs to be performed periodically. This is called VM load rebalancing (VMrB). Existing VMrB solutions consider either balancing across HMs (inter-HM) or balancing within each individual HM (intra-HM), but not both. In this paper, we give a systematic review of existing VMrB literature, and present a VMrB scheme named MOVMrB that optimizes load balancing of multiple resources across HMs and in each individual HM. Our solution is a true multiple-objective optimization approach that does not scalarize multiple resources into one measurement. Instead, we treat each resource as a separate dimension and convert the load balancing of multiple resources to a complex system optimization problem. In addition, we propose a hybrid VM live migration algorithm that can dramatically speed up the VMrB process. Extensive evaluations using synthetic and real data have been conducted to test the proposed solutions against existing VMrB studies. The results show that our scheme can achieve a more balanced inter-HM and intra-HM load in a more efficient way. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first approach that considers both inter-HM and intra-HM load balancing and does not scalarize multiple resources into one measurement.","doi":"10.1109/CLOUD.2016.0099","startPage":"710","endPage":"717","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE 9th International Conference on Cloud Computing (CLOUD)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7819578/7820017/07820336.pdf","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE 9th International Conference on Cloud Computing (CLOUD)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CLOUD.2016.0099","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7820017","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Novel Multi-objective Optimization Scheme for Rebalancing Virtual Machine Placement","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Load management","Cloud computing","Load modeling","Optimization methods","Bandwidth","Mathematical model"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","optimisation","resource allocation","virtual machines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["novel multiobjective optimization scheme","virtual machine placement","cloud computing","load balancing","host machines","VMrB scheme","MOVMrB","hybrid VM live migration algorithm","intra-HM load","inter-HM load"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7820336/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 27 2016-July 2 2016","displayDocTitle":"A Novel Multi-objective Optimization Scheme for Rebalancing Virtual Machine Placement","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7820336/","publicationDate":"June 2016","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2017","conferenceDate":"27 June-2 July 2016","accessionNumber":"16617484","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Novel Multi-objective Optimization Scheme for Rebalancing Virtual Machine Placement","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"2619a710.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066096S","chronDate":"June 27 2016-July 2 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7819578","isNumber":"7820017","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7819578","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"7820017","articleId":"7820336","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":7820337,"authors":[{"name":"Fawaz Paraiso","affiliation":["University of Lille & Inria Lille - Nord Europe, France"],"firstName":"Fawaz","lastName":"Paraiso","id":"37086029960"},{"name":"St\u00e9phanie Challita","affiliation":["University of Lille & Inria Lille - Nord Europe, France"],"firstName":"St\u00e9phanie","lastName":"Challita","id":"37086053122"},{"name":"Yahya Al-Dhuraibi","affiliation":["University of Lille & Inria Lille - Nord Europe, France"],"firstName":"Yahya","lastName":"Al-Dhuraibi","id":"37086054417"},{"name":"Philippe Merle","affiliation":["University of Lille & Inria Lille - Nord Europe, France"],"firstName":"Philippe","lastName":"Merle","id":"37667061600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2619-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2620-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2159-6190"}],"articleNumber":"7820337","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":32,"citationCountPatent":3,"totalDownloads":1123},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Containers","Computational modeling","Cloud computing","Synchronization","Context","Runtime","Buildings"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","Linux"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["model-driven management","lightweight Linux containers","Docker container management","event processing application"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cloud Computing","Container","Docker","Model Driven Engineering","Models@runtime"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7820337","doi":"10.1109/CLOUD.2016.0100","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CLOUD.2016.0100","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7820017","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE 9th International Conference on Cloud Computing (CLOUD)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE 9th International Conference on Cloud Computing (CLOUD)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7819578/7820017/07820337.pdf","startPage":"718","endPage":"725","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Model-Driven Management of Docker Containers","abstract":"With the emergence of Docker, it becomes easier to encapsulate applications and their dependencies into lightweight Linux containers and make them available to the world by deploying them in the cloud. Compared to hypervisor-based virtualization approaches, the use of containers provides faster start-ups times and reduces the consumption of computer resources. However, Docker lacks of deployability verification tool for containers at design time. Currently, the only way to be sure that the designed containers will execute well is to test them in a running system. If errors occur, a correction is made but this operation can be repeated several times before the deployment becomes operational. Docker does not provide a solution to increase or decrease the size of container resources in demand. Besides the deployment of containers, Docker lacks of synchronization between the designed containers and those deployed. Moreover, container management with Docker is done at low level, and therefore requires users to focus on low level system issues. In this paper we focus on these issues related to the management of Docker containers. In particular, we propose an approach for modeling Docker containers. We provide tooling to ensure the deployability and the management of Docker containers. We illustrate our proposal using an event processing application and show how our solution provides a significantly better compromise between performance and development costs than the basic Docker container solution.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7820337/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 27 2016-July 2 2016","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"27 June-2 July 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7820337/","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2017","publicationDate":"June 2016","accessionNumber":"16617506","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Model-Driven Management of Docker Containers","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Model-Driven Management of Docker Containers","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"2619a718.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.092089S","chronDate":"June 27 2016-July 2 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7819578","isNumber":"7820017","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7819578","citationCount":"32","xplore-issue":"7820017","articleId":"7820337","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":7820341,"authors":[{"name":"Kostas Katsalis","affiliation":["Mobile Communications Dept., Institut Eurecom, France"],"firstName":"Kostas","lastName":"Katsalis","id":"37860094300"},{"name":"Thanasis G.

However, although cloud computing can be used to meet traditional challenges, like scalability concerns and provide for fast resource provisioning times, a multifaceted analysis is required when it comes in multi-operator environments with time-critical applications and services. In this work, we claim that the service importance must be at the epicenter when it comes to the scheduling and placement decision of whether to deploy the service at the edge network or not. Virtual machine (VM) scheduling decisions should avoid SLA violations for popular or time-critical services, and be fair between the service providers. A Lyapunov optimization framework is derived to solve this stochastic optimization problem that aims to maximize the revenue of the physical infrastructure owner in a multi-network operator-sharing environment with time-critical SLAs. A series of simulation experiments validate the high effectiveness of the proposed approach over benchmarking ones.","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7820341","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cloud computing","Mobile communication","Servers","Mobile computing","Time factors","Optimization","Delays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","contracts","mobile computing","optimisation","virtual machines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["SLA-driven VM scheduling","mobile edge computing","MEC","cloud computing","multifaceted analysis","Lyapunov optimization framework","stochastic optimization problem"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["VM scheduling","Mobile Edge Computing","Stochastic Optimization","Service Differentiation","Mobile Cloud"]}],"publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE 9th International Conference on Cloud Computing (CLOUD)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE 9th International Conference on Cloud Computing (CLOUD)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7819578/7820017/07820341.pdf","startPage":"750","endPage":"757","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7820017","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CLOUD.2016.0104","doi":"10.1109/CLOUD.2016.0104","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"SLA-Driven VM Scheduling in Mobile Edge Computing","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 27 2016-July 2 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7820341/","displayDocTitle":"SLA-Driven VM Scheduling in Mobile Edge Computing","isDynamicHtml":true,"isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"27 June-2 July 2016","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2017","publicationDate":"June 2016","accessionNumber":"16617489","htmlLink":"/document/7820341/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"SLA-Driven VM Scheduling in Mobile Edge Computing","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"2619a750.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.093189S","chronDate":"June 27 2016-July 2 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7819578","isNumber":"7820017","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7819578","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"7820017","articleId":"7820341","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7820361,"authors":[{"name":"V.

Traditional solutions exploit the metrics at system level to detect the anomaly. However, system level metrics are too coarse to remedy the fluctuation and locate the real root cause. In this paper, we present a system called TaskInsight, which could detect performance anomaly and locate the problem at a fine-grained task level in a black-box fashion. It leverages unsupervised clustering approach cooperated with the multitasking type to induce the normal resource usage behavior patterns from historical data. The evaluation result shows that TaskInsight can detect the common performance anomaly precisely. Furthermore, it could easily locate the malicious or anomalous task.

A MOP is firstly decomposed into a set of simple single-objective optimization sub-problems, and the objective space of the MOP is also decomposed into some number of sub-objective spaces. Then, each sub-objective space is considered as the feasible region of the corresponding single-objective problem. For each sub-problem, solutions of the feasible region are better than solutions of the infeasible region, which can maintain quite well the diversity of obtained solutions. Moreover, MOEA/D-MCS compares with MOEA/D UMOEA/D, GDRE3 d NSGAIII on six multi-objective benchmark functions. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm is able to obtain a set of solutions with better diversity and convergence.","doi":"10.1109/CIS.2016.0017","startPage":"33","endPage":"38","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 12th International Conference on Computational Intelligence and Security (CIS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7819579/7820391/07820408.pdf","publicationTitle":"2016 12th International Conference on Computational Intelligence and Security (CIS)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CIS.2016.0017","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7820391","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A New Evolutionary Algorithm Based on Decomposition for Multi-Objective Optimization Problems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Evolutionary computation","Sociology","Approximation algorithms","Pareto optimization","Algorithm design and analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiobjective evolutionary algorithms","multiobjective optimization problems","MOP decomposition","constrained single-objective subproblems","MOEA/D-MCS","single-objective optimization subproblems","subobjective space","multiobjective benchmark functions","GDRE3 d NSGAIII","MOEA/D UMOEA/D"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Multi-objective optimization","Evolutionary algorithm","Artificial intelligence","Decomposition"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7820408/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-19 Dec. 2016","displayDocTitle":"A New Evolutionary Algorithm Based on Decomposition for Multi-Objective Optimization Problems","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7820408/","publicationDate":"Dec. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2017","conferenceDate":"16-19 Dec. 2016","accessionNumber":"16617553","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A New Evolutionary Algorithm Based on Decomposition for Multi-Objective Optimization Problems","confLoc":"Wuxi, China","sourcePdf":"4840a033.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.158003S","chronDate":"16-19 Dec. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7819579","isNumber":"7820391","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7819579","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7820391","articleId":"7820408","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7820413,"authors":[{"name":"Qizhen Zhou","affiliation":["College of Defense Engineering, PLA University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, Jiangsu, China"],"firstName":"Qizhen","lastName":"Zhou","id":"37086092915"},{"name":"Jianchun Xing","affiliation":["College of Defense Engineering, PLA University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, Jiangsu, China"],"firstName":"Jianchun","lastName":"Xing","id":"37392544900"},{"name":"Juelong Li","affiliation":["Technical Management Office of Naval Defense Engineering, Beijing, China","College of Defense Engineering, PLA University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, Jiangsu, China"],"firstName":"Juelong","lastName":"Li","id":"37899056200"},{"name":"Qiliang Yang","affiliation":["Research Center of Building Information Modeling, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China","College of Defense Engineering, PLA University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, Jiangsu, China"],"firstName":"Qiliang","lastName":"Yang","id":"37086088458"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4840-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4841-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7820413","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":12,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":875},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Feature extraction","Gesture recognition","Machine learning","Band-pass filters","IEEE 802.11 Standard","Wireless sensor networks","Wireless communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feature extraction","gesture recognition","image classification","image denoising","learning (artificial intelligence)","support vector machines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["device-free number gesture recognition","human-computer interface","channel state information","CSI-based technologies","coarse grained feature extraction","macromovement recognition","DeNum","denoised CSI values","multiple sliding windows","discriminative feature extraction","phase information","amplitude information","gesture information","number gesture information","support vector machine","gesture classification","Wi-Fi devices","SVM","4-layer deep learning model"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Number gesture recognition","Channel State Information","Deep learning","Wi-Fi"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7820413","abstract":"Number gestures play essential parts in our daily communication and have attracted academic interests in developing Human-Computer Interface. In this paper, we resort to the fine-grained Channel State Information (CSI) in the 802.11n standard to recognize number gestures. The intuition is that certain gestures can affect wireless environment in a specific formation and thus generate unique features. Unfortunately, the majority of CSI-based technologies only extracted coarse grained features to recognize macro-movements. Besides, it can be time-consuming to select the most discriminative feature as salient evidence. In this paper, we present a device-free number gesture recognition approach based on deep learning, named DeNum. First, we explore the sensibility of both the amplitude and phase information of de-noised CSI values to action transitions. Then the amplitude difference is utilized to detect the finishing points of actions through multiple sliding windows. To extract discriminative features from both the amplitude and phase information over three antennas, a 4-layer deep learning model is adopted after obtaining number gesture information. Finally, a Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm is applied for gesture classification. We conduct extensive experiments on commercial Wi-Fi devices with different experimental parameters. Experimental results demonstrate the presented approach can achieve the average accuracy of 94% in current office scenario.","doi":"10.1109/CIS.2016.0022","publicationTitle":"2016 12th International Conference on Computational Intelligence and Security (CIS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 12th International Conference on Computational Intelligence and Security (CIS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7819579/7820391/07820413.pdf","startPage":"57","endPage":"63","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CIS.2016.0022","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7820391","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Device-Free Number Gesture Recognition Approach Based on Deep Learning","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A Device-Free Number Gesture Recognition Approach Based on Deep Learning","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2017","accessionNumber":"16617662","publicationDate":"Dec. 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7820413/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7820413/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-19 Dec. 2016","conferenceDate":"16-19 Dec. 2016","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Device-Free Number Gesture Recognition Approach Based on Deep Learning","confLoc":"Wuxi, China","sourcePdf":"4840a057.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053891S","chronDate":"16-19 Dec. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7819579","isNumber":"7820391","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7819579","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"7820391","articleId":"7820413","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7820415,"authors":[{"name":"Vahid Behravan","affiliation":["Oregon State University, Corvallis, OR, USA"],"firstName":"Vahid","lastName":"Behravan","id":"37085649588"},{"name":"Gurjeet Singh","affiliation":["Oregon State University, Corvallis, OR, USA"],"firstName":"Gurjeet","lastName":"Singh","id":"37085875007"},{"name":"Patrick Y.

However, airborne navigation sensors are not accurate enough to support ideal alignment of synthetic and real image in CVS naturally. In this paper we investigate the effects of aircraft position and attitude errors on the projection accuracy of synthetic image in CVS. The major contribution of this paper lies in two aspects. Firstly, a projection model is established and the probability distributions of pixel errors are estimated. Secondly, four simulation scenarios are developed to evaluate the effects of position and attitude errors on the projection accuracy. The experimental results show that aircraft attitude error has more significant impact than position error on the pixel projection accuracy. The impacts of yaw error and roll error on the pixel error of synthetic image are larger and belong to primary factors. The probability distribution of pixel error obeys Gaussian, but the standard deviation of pixel row error is greater than column error with the same aircraft position and attitude parameters.","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 12th International Conference on Computational Intelligence and Security (CIS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7819579/7820391/07820421.pdf","startPage":"95","endPage":"99","publicationTitle":"2016 12th International Conference on Computational Intelligence and Security (CIS)","doi":"10.1109/CIS.2016.0030","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CIS.2016.0030","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7820391","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7820421","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis of Projection Accuracy of Synthetic Image in Combined Vision System","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Aircraft","Mathematical model","Cameras","Atmospheric modeling","Airports","Navigation","Machine vision"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["aerospace computing","computer vision","Gaussian distribution","image resolution"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["projection accuracy analysis","synthetic image","combined vision system","CVS","critical image alignment","aircraft position errors","aircraft attitude errors","probability distribution estimation","projection model","yaw error","roll error","pixel row error"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["combined vision system","position and attitude error","projection accuracy","simulation analysis"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7820421/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-19 Dec. 2016","displayDocTitle":"Analysis of Projection Accuracy of Synthetic Image in Combined Vision System","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7820421/","publicationDate":"Dec. 2016","accessionNumber":"16617512","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2017","conferenceDate":"16-19 Dec. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis of Projection Accuracy of Synthetic Image in Combined Vision System","confLoc":"Wuxi, China","sourcePdf":"4840a095.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.079952S","chronDate":"16-19 Dec. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7819579","isNumber":"7820391","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7819579","xplore-issue":"7820391","articleId":"7820421","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7820444,"authors":[{"name":"Qiang Wang","affiliation":["Guangdong University of Technology, Guangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Qiang","lastName":"Wang","id":"37075382000"},{"name":"Hailin Liu","affiliation":["Guangdong University of Technology, Guangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Hailin","lastName":"Liu","id":"37537714600"},{"name":"Yiu-Ming Cheung","affiliation":["Hong Kong Baptist University, Hongkong, China"],"firstName":"Yiu-Ming","lastName":"Cheung","id":"37279219500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4840-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4841-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7820444","dbTime":"27 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":124},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Renewable energy sources","Optimization","Delays","Sociology","Statistics","Green products","Resource management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cooperative communication","delays","energy harvesting","evolutionary computation","OFDM modulation","renewable energy sources","telecommunication power management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["renewable energy cooperation scheme","OFDM systems","evolutionary many-objective optimization algorithm","energy harvesting","green communication","base stations","network delay"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["green communication","energy cooperation","resource allocation","many objective optimization problem"]}],"abstract":"Energy harvesting has drawn more and more attention because of the requirement of the green communication. It is well known that energy harvesting is one of the most important technologies of the green communication. Due to the intermittency of the renewable energy and the different space of the Base stations (BSs), the renewable energy cooperation is necessary to improve the renewable energy efficiency. In this paper, we propose a renewable energy cooperation scheme among different BSs, in which one BS can collect (share) energy from (to) another BSs. It is obvious that the energy cooperation efficiency will be improved when the number of the BSs that join the cooperation scheme is large. In this paper, our objective is to minimize the networks delay of each BS. To minimize the networks delay, it is reasonable that each BS hopes to transfer its energy to another BSs as little as possible, and collects energy from another BSs as much as possible. Thus, the objective of each BS are conflicting. We formulate the joint optimization problem into a many-objective mixed integer optimization problem which is difficult to optimize. We adopt the evolutionary many-objective algorithm based on decomposition and reference distance to optimize the problem. Simulation results show that the effectiveness of the algorithm.","doi":"10.1109/CIS.2016.0053","publicationTitle":"2016 12th International Conference on Computational Intelligence and Security (CIS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 12th International Conference on Computational Intelligence and Security (CIS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7819579/7820391/07820444.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CIS.2016.0053","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7820391","startPage":"194","endPage":"197","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Renewable Energy Cooperation Scheme for OFDM Systems Using Evolutionary Many-Objective Optimization Algorithm","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7820444","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A Renewable Energy Cooperation Scheme for OFDM Systems Using Evolutionary Many-Objective Optimization Algorithm","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-19 Dec. 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7820444/","conferenceDate":"16-19 Dec. 2016","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2016","accessionNumber":"16617599","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7820444/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Renewable Energy Cooperation Scheme for OFDM Systems Using Evolutionary Many-Objective Optimization Algorithm","confLoc":"Wuxi, China","sourcePdf":"4840a194.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055457S","chronDate":"16-19 Dec. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7819579","isNumber":"7820391","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7819579","xplore-issue":"7820391","articleId":"7820444","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7820466,"authors":[{"name":"Jing Fang","affiliation":["Faculty of Information Technology & Beijing Engineering Research Center for IoT Software and Systems, Beijing University of Technology, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Jing","lastName":"Fang","id":"37086141647"},{"name":"Jingsha He","affiliation":["Faculty of Information Technology & Beijing Engineering Research Center for IoT Software and Systems, Beijing University of Technology, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Jingsha","lastName":"He","id":"37086134740"},{"name":"Muhammad Salman Pathan","affiliation":["Faculty of Information Technology & Beijing Engineering Research Center for IoT Software and Systems, Beijing University of Technology, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Muhammad Salman","lastName":"Pathan","id":"37086138067"},{"name":"Mengchen Gao","affiliation":["Faculty of Information Technology & Beijing Engineering Research Center for IoT Software and Systems, Beijing University of Technology, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Mengchen","lastName":"Gao","id":"37086135308"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4840-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4841-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7820466","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":159},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Novel Storage and Search Scheme in Cloud Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 12th International Conference on Computational Intelligence and Security (CIS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7819579/7820391/07820466.pdf","startPage":"304","endPage":"308","publicationTitle":"2016 12th International Conference on Computational Intelligence and Security (CIS)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CIS.2016.0075","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7820391","doi":"10.1109/CIS.2016.0075","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cloud computing","Servers","Indexes","Encryption","Keyword search"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","data protection","fuzzy set theory","trees (mathematics)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","data privacy","data security","fuzzy keyword search","result ranking","trie-traverse tree","fuzzy set construction","data protection"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["cloud computing","data security and privacy","searchable encryption","ranking","fuzzy search"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7820466","abstract":"The emerging field of cloud computing is still evolving with the immense momentum all over the world. Due to its super-large scale and unprecedented computational capabilities, cloud storage is selected as the preferred choice for individuals and organizations to store extensive amount of data. However, the characteristics of cloud computing have raised issues of privacy and security. To protect data from threats related to privacy and security, most users would choose searchable encryption as a solution not only to preserve privacy but also to maintain the searchable and retrievable functionality. Although many searchable encryption schemes over cloud computing have been proposed to retrieve encrypted information, they seldom take sorting search results into consideration. In this paper, we present a scheme that supports fuzzy keyword search and result ranking. To reduce the risk of data leakage and enhance security, we use two cloud servers to store the encrypted index and files respectively. This novel scheme uses posting list associated with trie-traverse tree to build a secure index and to achieve the purpose of ranking. Furthermore, the trapdoor generation process combines the wildcard and dictionary based fuzzy set construction to support fuzzy search. Simulation results show that the proposed method is feasible and efficient.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7820466/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-19 Dec. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"Dec. 2016","accessionNumber":"16617522","htmlLink":"/document/7820466/","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2017","conferenceDate":"16-19 Dec. 2016","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A Novel Storage and Search Scheme in Cloud Computing","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Novel Storage and Search Scheme in Cloud Computing","confLoc":"Wuxi, China","sourcePdf":"4840a304.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.090262S","chronDate":"16-19 Dec. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7819579","isNumber":"7820391","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7819579","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7820391","articleId":"7820466","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7820484,"authors":[{"name":"Feng Wang","affiliation":["Faculty of Computer Science and Engineering, Xi'an University of Technology, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Feng","lastName":"Wang","id":"37086099246"},{"name":"Junhuai Li","affiliation":["Faculty of Computer Science and Engineering, Xi'an University of Technology, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Junhuai","lastName":"Li","id":"37538142200"},{"name":"Jing Zhang","affiliation":["Faculty of Computer Science and Engineering, Xi'an University of Technology, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Jing","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37540283400"},{"name":"Qiang Huang","affiliation":["Institute of water Resources and hydro-electric Engineering, Xi'an University of Technology, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Qiang","lastName":"Huang","id":"37405853600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4840-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4841-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7820484","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":72},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7820484","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Servers","Cloud computing","Virtual machining","Security","Database systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["database management systems","genetic algorithms","virtual machines","water supply"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multitenant placement genetic algorithm","eucalyptus platform","database system","rural drinking water supply system","data storage","sharing model","tenant placement algorithm","virtual machine","service quality","hardware resources"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Eucalyptus","Multi-tenant","placement algorithm"]}],"doi":"10.1109/CIS.2016.0093","pdfPath":"/iel7/7819579/7820391/07820484.pdf","publicationTitle":"2016 12th International Conference on Computational Intelligence and Security (CIS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 12th International Conference on Computational Intelligence and Security (CIS)","startPage":"382","endPage":"385","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7820391","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CIS.2016.0093","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Research on the Multi-Tenant Placement Genetic Algorithm Based on Eucalyptus Platform","abstract":"This paper describes a database system with tenant technology on Eucalyptus platform for a rural drinking water supply system.

Nonetheless, energy consumption will be non-negligible when a large number of smallcell Base Stations (BSs) are densely deployed. One practical and effective approach to reduce the energy consumption of the UDN is through dynamically controlling the power saving mode of BSs, while the challenge is to maintain network coverage and satisfy the performance requirements of User Equipment (UEs). In this paper, we formalize the problem of minimizing the energy consumption of BSs by optimally controlling the BS's power saving mode (switching between awake mode and sleep mode). We focus on optimal BS selection with the objective of energy efficiency, while the considering the constraints of the coverage of UEs, the capacity of BSs, and the data rate UEs. To validate the effectiveness of our proposed scheme, we have conducted performance evaluations with a comprehensive scenario design, consisting of UE density, distribution, and mobility, as well as BS deployment. The evaluation results demonstrate favorable energy efficiency improvement at averages of 38.82 % and 48.05 % in scenarios where UEs are uniformly distributed and non-uniformly distributed in the network.

The market data feed containing up-to-date information on market changes is multicasted real-timely from financial exchanges to market participants, usually in the form of financial information exchange (FIX) Adapted for STreaming (FAST) protocol. FAST is a differential compression protocol which significantly reduces the bandwidth requirement to transmit market data. However, it also increases the complexity and latency of market data processing. This paper describes a customized architecture for ultra-low latency of market-data processing. Firstly, we propose a bus-based architecture of market-data decoding on Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA). Our design is a loose-coupled and scalable architecture which is easy to adapt to different FAST templates by connecting different decoders to the main bus. Then we further exploit a dedicated pipelined design to improve the architecture. The pipelined architecture decompresses multiple messages in parallel, overcoming the challenge of data dependency between consecutive differential encoded (FAST) messages. Finally, we implement two prototypes in RTL code and evaluate them on a Xilinx Kintex-7 FPGA. Real test results show that 1) the pipelined processor gains 180% speedup compared with the non-pipelined processor; 2) it achieves an ultra-low decoding latency of 307 ns per message, which is 2 orders of magnitude faster than the software solution.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Decoding","Protocols","Field programmable gate arrays","Computer architecture","Data processing","Hardware","Encoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data compression","decoding","field programmable gate arrays","financial data processing","parallel architectures","pipeline processing","protocols","stock markets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["pipelined market data processing architecture","financial data dependency","ultralow decoding latency ability","market data feed","instant trading profits","financial information exchange","adapted for streaming protocol","FAST protocol","differential compression protocol","bandwidth requirement","market-data decoding","field programmable gate array","FPGA","loose-coupled scalable architecture","FAST templates","message decompression","data dependency","consecutive differential encoded messages","RTL code","Xilinx Kintex-7 FPGA","pipelined processor","nonpipelined processor"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7820632","doi":"10.1109/PCCC.2016.7820632","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE 35th International Performance Computing and Communications Conference (IPCCC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7803497/7820593/07820632.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PCCC.2016.7820632","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7820593","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE 35th International Performance Computing and Communications Conference (IPCCC)","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A pipelined market data processing architecture to overcome financial data dependency","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A pipelined market data processing architecture to overcome financial data dependency","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7820632/","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"9-11 Dec. 2016","conferenceDate":"9-11 Dec. 2016","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7820632/","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2017","publicationDate":"Dec. 2016","accessionNumber":"16603372","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A pipelined market data processing architecture to overcome financial data dependency","confLoc":"Las Vegas, NV, USA","sourcePdf":"Session204.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058403S","chronDate":"9-11 Dec. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7803497","isNumber":"7820593","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7803497","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7820593","articleId":"7820632","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7820633,"authors":[{"name":"Mohak Chadha","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Information Systems, Goa, India"],"firstName":"Mohak","lastName":"Chadha","id":"37086073446"},{"name":"Abhishek Srivastava","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Information Systems, Goa, India"],"firstName":"Abhishek","lastName":"Srivastava","id":"37086147512"},{"name":"Santonu Sarkar","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Information Systems, Goa, India"],"firstName":"Santonu","lastName":"Sarkar","id":"37085617940"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-5252-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-5251-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-5253-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2374-9628"}],"articleNumber":"7820633","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":99},"abstract":"Power and energy optimization of applications running on a High Performance Computing infrastructure is an important research area in today's HPC driven world. Considerable amount of investments are being made for the same, emphasizing on the importance of such a research. The above mentioned optimization is a two step process. First, one must measure and analyze the power consumption accurately and then optimize the application by modifying the relevant sections of the application software responsible for it. In this paper we propose an API, called the Unified Power Profiling API (UPPAPI), which allows a parallel application developer to measure the power and energy consumed by the heterogeneous system during the application execution. The first important feature of this API is the abstraction created over different co-processors. Second, we have incorporated a corrective power model to remove the discrepancy arising out of the on-board GPU sensors. We illustrate the working of the above mentioned tool using Rodinia and SHOC Benchmarks. We further verify the correctness of the API generated measurement by comparing the results returned by the API with the actual power measured with a Krykard ALM10 power analyzer. This paper is an early attempt to develop a well rounded software tool, which enables the developer to optimize the resource usage and create efficient applications.","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE 35th International Performance Computing and Communications Conference (IPCCC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7803497/7820593/07820633.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE 35th International Performance Computing and Communications Conference (IPCCC)","doi":"10.1109/PCCC.2016.7820633","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PCCC.2016.7820633","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7820593","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7820633","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Unified power and energy measurement API for HPC co-processors","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Graphics processing units","Power measurement","Central Processing Unit","Hardware","Radiation detectors","Object oriented modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["application program interfaces","energy conservation","graphics processing units","parallel processing","power aware computing","power consumption"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["unified power-energy measurement API","HPC coprocessors","energy optimization","high performance computing infrastructure","power consumption","power optimization","UPPAPI","parallel application","heterogeneous system","on-board GPU sensors","Rodinia Benchmarks","SHOC Benchmarks","Krykard ALM10 power analyzer","software tool","resource usage optimization"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7820633/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-11 Dec. 2016","displayDocTitle":"Unified power and energy measurement API for HPC co-processors","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7820633/","publicationDate":"Dec. 2016","accessionNumber":"16603323","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2017","conferenceDate":"9-11 Dec. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Unified power and energy measurement API for HPC co-processors","confLoc":"Las Vegas, NV, USA","sourcePdf":"Session205.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.112897S","chronDate":"9-11 Dec. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7803497","isNumber":"7820593","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7803497","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7820593","articleId":"7820633","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7820640,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaoheng Deng","affiliation":["School of Information Science & Engineering, Central South University, Changsha, China"],"firstName":"Xiaoheng","lastName":"Deng","id":"37286655600"},{"name":"Weijian Zhong","affiliation":["School of Information Science & Engineering, Central South University, Changsha, China"],"firstName":"Weijian","lastName":"Zhong","id":"37086177564"},{"name":"Ju Ren","affiliation":["School of Information Science & Engineering, Central South University, Changsha, China"],"firstName":"Ju","lastName":"Ren","id":"37085390487"},{"name":"Detian Zeng","affiliation":["School of Information Science & Engineering, Central South University, Changsha, China"],"firstName":"Detian","lastName":"Zeng","id":"37086174896"},{"name":"Honggang Zhang","affiliation":["Engineering Department, University of Massachusetts Boston"],"firstName":"Honggang","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37280788800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-5252-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-5251-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-5253-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2374-9628"}],"articleNumber":"7820640","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":366},"abstract":"Classification of imbalanced datasets has become one of the most challenging problems in big data mining. Because the number of positive samples is far less than the negative samples, low accuracy and poor generalization performance and some other defects always go with learning process of traditional algorithms. Ensemble construction algorithm is an important method to handle this problem. Especially, the ensemble construction algorithm based on random under-sampling or clustering can effectively improve the performance of classification. However, the former causes information loss easily and the latter increases complexity. In this paper, we propose ACUS, an improved ensemble algorithm based on automatic clustering and under-sampling. ACUS conducts clustering first according to the weight of samples, and then it constructs balanced-distributed dataset which consists of a certain percentage of the majority class and all of the minority class from each cluster. With Adaboost algorithm construction, these datasets are used to get an ensemble classifier. Experimental results demonstrate the advantages of our proposed algorithm in terms of accuracy, simplicity and high stability.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Clustering

cognitive radio networks (CRNs) faces many limitations that make it challenging. First, traditional routing protocols cannot be directly applied in CRNs because they consider fixed frequency band. Second, cognitive radio enables dynamic spectrum access which causes adverse effects on network performance. Third, effective routing in CR Networks (CRNs) needs local and continual knowledge of its environment. Last, presence of malicious nodes and their misbehaving activities affect the route establishment and therefore reduce the network performance. In this paper, we address such limitations by combining spectrum sensing and routing to propose a novel routing algorithm that uses nodes' behavior during spectrum sensing phase as a routing metric. Through the spectrum sensing phase, nodes behavior is measured through a parameter called belief level (BL), which describes the node's reliability to correctly sense the spectrum and to use spectrum channels accordingly. Moreover, we secure the routing requests and reply messages by encrypting them utilizing the existing cryptography techniques. The proposed approach is designed to maximize security level of paths, minimize the effects of licensed users activity over spectrum channels, and reduce the total channels cost over the best path(s). Evaluation of the proposed approach shows that its performance outperforms many current state-of-the-art routing algorithms used in CRNs in terms of end-to-end delay, packet delivery ratio, and packet loss ratio.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7820642/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-11 Dec. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2017","accessionNumber":"16603384","htmlLink":"/document/7820642/","conferenceDate":"9-11 Dec. 2016","displayDocTitle":"A secure routing algorithm based on nodes behavior during spectrum sensing in cognitive radio networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A secure routing algorithm based on nodes behavior during spectrum sensing in cognitive radio networks","confLoc":"Las Vegas, NV, USA","sourcePdf":"Session502.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062172S","chronDate":"9-11 Dec. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7803497","isNumber":"7820593","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7803497","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7820593","articleId":"7820642","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7820647,"authors":[{"name":"Yujian Zhang","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Engineering, Southeast University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Yujian","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37086072551"},{"name":"Yun Wang","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Engineering, Southeast University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Yun","lastName":"Wang","id":"37085636764"},{"name":"Hui Wang","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Engineering, Southeast University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Hui","lastName":"Wang","id":"37085637476"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-5252-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-5251-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-5253-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2374-9628"}],"articleNumber":"7820647","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":331},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7820647","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Energy consumption","Processor scheduling","Dynamic scheduling","Linear programming","Optimization","Schedules"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data flow analysis","linear programming","parallel processing","power aware computing","processor scheduling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["energy-efficient task scheduling","dynamic voltage and frequency scaling","DVFS","heterogeneous computing system","HCS","linear programming","slack reclamation","runtime precedence-constraint","processor-constraint"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["energy-efficient","task scheduling","linear programming","dynamic voltage and frequency scaling","heterogeneous computing system"]}],"abstract":"The energy consumption in heterogeneous computing systems (HCS) has attracted a great deal of attention in both scientific and commercial fields due to operating and environmental concerns. Based on the technique of dynamic voltage and frequency scaling (DVFS), many studies have investigated and developed efficient task scheduling algorithms for energy reduction. However, most of them provide only one refined frequency for each task to perform slack reclamation. Moreover, the total energy-saving is accumulated by individual local minimum of energy consumption with less or no global consideration. In this paper, we use a linear combination of processor frequencies to execute each task and allocate time slices for these frequencies by a linear programming approach. The goal of energy reduction is represented by a global function associated with the set of time slices while the constraint declarations are given by runtime precedence-constraints and processor-constraints, respectively. In this case, the problem of energy-efficient task scheduling becomes a linear program which can be solved by a mature set of linear programming solvers. The experimental results show the effectiveness of our proposed method and demonstrate the superior performance over existing approaches without sacrificing the schedule length.","doi":"10.1109/PCCC.2016.7820647","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE 35th International Performance Computing and Communications Conference (IPCCC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE 35th International Performance Computing and Communications Conference (IPCCC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7803497/7820593/07820647.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PCCC.2016.7820647","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7820593","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Energy-efficient task scheduling for DVFS-enabled heterogeneous computing systems using a linear programming approach","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"9-11 Dec. 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7820647/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-11 Dec. 2016","displayDocTitle":"Energy-efficient task scheduling for DVFS-enabled heterogeneous computing systems using a linear programming approach","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7820647/","accessionNumber":"16603348","publicationDate":"Dec. 2016","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy-efficient task scheduling for DVFS-enabled heterogeneous computing systems using a linear programming approach","confLoc":"Las Vegas, NV, USA","sourcePdf":"Session604.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.0664S","chronDate":"9-11 Dec. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7803497","isNumber":"7820593","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7803497","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"7820593","articleId":"7820647","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":7820648,"authors":[{"name":"Jiayin Wang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Massachusetts Boston, Boston, MA"],"firstName":"Jiayin","lastName":"Wang","id":"37085418891"},{"name":"Teng Wang","affiliation":["University of Massachusetts Boston, Boston, MA, US"],"firstName":"Teng","lastName":"Wang"},{"name":"Zhengyu Yang","affiliation":["Northeastern University, Boston, MA, US"],"firstName":"Zhengyu","lastName":"Yang"},{"name":"Ningfang Mi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Northeastern University, Boston, MA"],"firstName":"Ningfang","lastName":"Mi","id":"37603427400"},{"name":"Bo Sheng","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Massachusetts Boston, Boston, MA"],"firstName":"Bo","lastName":"Sheng","id":"37266459400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-5252-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-5251-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-5253-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2374-9628"}],"articleNumber":"7820648","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":10,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":166},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7820648","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hardware","Delays","Data processing","Estimation","Reliability","Sparks","Monitoring"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiprocessing systems","parallel processing","reliability","workstation clusters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["eSplash","heterogeneous computing systems","efficient speculation framework","heterogeneous cluster","cluster slow node","reliability","MapReduce","representative computing platform","straggler node identification","failure detection","job execution","Hadoop distribution"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we aim to develop an efficient speculation framework for a heterogeneous cluster.

On the one hand, our approach significantly reduces unnecessary speculative executions that occupy system resources, but do not get finished. On the other hand, when a node is prone to failure, our solution is able to detect it at an early stage and effectively launch a speculative task to avoid the delay in the job execution. We implement our solution in Hadoop platform and evaluate it with extensive experiments. The results show that our solution is efficient and effective when handling the speculative execution.

Containers are becoming an important cornerstone, which is increasingly used day-by-day. Among different available frameworks, docker has become one of the major adoptees to use containerized platform in data centers and enterprise servers, due to its ease of deploying and scaling. Further more, the performance benefits of a lightweight container platform can be leveraged even more with a fast back-end storage like high performance SSDs. However, increase in number of simultaneously operating docker containers may not guarantee an aggregated performance improvement due to saturation. Thus, understanding performance bottleneck in a multi-tenancy docker environment is critically important to maintain application level fairness and perform better resource management. In this paper, we characterize the performance of persistent storage option (through data volume) for I/O intensive, dockerized applications. Our work investigates the impact on performance with increasing number of simultaneous docker containers in different workload environments. We provide, first of its kind study of I/O intensive containerized applications operating with NVMe SSDs. We show that 1) a six times better application throughput can be obtained, just by wise selection of number of containerized instances compared to single instance; and 2) for multiple application containers running simultaneously, an application throughput may degrade upto 50% compared to a stand-alone applications throughput, if good choice of application and workload is not made. We then propose novel design guidelines for an optimal and fair operation of both homogeneous and heterogeneous environments mixed with different applications and workloads.","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE 35th International Performance Computing and Communications Conference (IPCCC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7803497/7820593/07820650.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE 35th International Performance Computing and Communications Conference (IPCCC)","doi":"10.1109/PCCC.2016.7820650","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PCCC.2016.7820650","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7820593","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7820650","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Understanding performance of I/O intensive containerized applications for NVMe SSDs","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Containers","Databases","Throughput","Central Processing Unit","Virtual machining","Hardware","Resource management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","random-access storage","storage management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["I/O intensive containerized applications","NVMe SSD","cloud-based IT world","data centers","enterprise servers","lightweight container platform","back-end storage","multitenancy docker environment","application level fairness","resource management","docker containers","design guidelines"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Docker containers","Flash-Memory","SSDs","NVMe","MySQL","Cassandra","FIO","Database"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7820650/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-11 Dec. 2016","displayDocTitle":"Understanding performance of I/O intensive containerized applications for NVMe SSDs","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7820650/","publicationDate":"Dec. 2016","accessionNumber":"16603327","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2017","conferenceDate":"9-11 Dec. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Understanding performance of I/O intensive containerized applications for NVMe SSDs","confLoc":"Las Vegas, NV, USA","sourcePdf":"Session703.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.07531S","chronDate":"9-11 Dec. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7803497","isNumber":"7820593","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7803497","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"7820593","articleId":"7820650","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7820659,"authors":[{"name":"Xi Tao","affiliation":["Department of Computer Information Science Engineering, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL"],"firstName":"Xi","lastName":"Tao","id":"37072309400"},{"name":"Qi Zeng","affiliation":["Department of Computer Information Science Engineering, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL"],"firstName":"Qi","lastName":"Zeng","id":"37085990177"},{"name":"Jih-Kwon Peir","affiliation":["Department of Computer Information Science Engineering, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL"],"firstName":"Jih-Kwon","lastName":"Peir","id":"37294178300"},{"name":"Shih-Lien Lu","affiliation":["TSMC, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Shih-Lien","lastName":"Lu","id":"38184308200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-5252-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-5251-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-5253-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2374-9628"}],"articleNumber":"7820659","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":129},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Small cache lookaside table for fast DRAM cache access","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE 35th International Performance Computing and Communications Conference (IPCCC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7803497/7820593/07820659.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"10","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE 35th International Performance Computing and Communications Conference (IPCCC)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PCCC.2016.7820659","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7820593","doi":"10.1109/PCCC.2016.7820659","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Random access memory","Arrays","Bandwidth","Memory management","Metals","Performance evaluation","Indexes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cache storage","DRAM chips"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["DRAM cache access","cache lookaside table","CLT","off-die tag array","average access latency"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7820659","abstract":"Large off-die stacked DRAM caches have been proposed to provide higher effective bandwidth and lower average latency to main memory. Designing a large off-die DRAM cache with conventional block size requires a large tag array which is impractical to fit on-die. Placing the large directory off-die prolong the latency since a tag access is necessary before the data can be accessed. This additional trip also generates extra off-die traffic. In this paper, we present a novel design called Cache Lookaside Table (CLT) to reduce the average access latency and to lessen off-die tag array accesses. The basic approach is to cache a small amount of recently referenced tags on-die. An off-die tag access is avoided when a requested block's tag hits a cached tag. To save on-die space, cached tags are recorded in a large sector for sharing tags with multiple blocks. However, due to the loss of one-to-one physical mapping of the cached tags and the data array, a way pointer is added for each block to indicate its way location. The proposed CLT exploits memory reference locality and provides a fast alternative tag path to capture most of the DRAM cache requests. In comparison with other proposed DRAM caching mechanisms, the on-die CLT approach shows an average performance improvement in the range of 4-15%.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7820659/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-11 Dec. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"Dec. 2016","accessionNumber":"16603349","htmlLink":"/document/7820659/","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2017","conferenceDate":"9-11 Dec. 2016","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Small cache lookaside table for fast DRAM cache access","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Small cache lookaside table for fast DRAM cache access","confLoc":"Las Vegas, NV, USA","sourcePdf":"Session902.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070341S","chronDate":"9-11 Dec. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7803497","isNumber":"7820593","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7803497","xplore-issue":"7820593","articleId":"7820659","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7820660,"authors":[{"name":"Wenjie Liu","affiliation":["Wuhan National Lab for Optoelectronics, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, China"],"firstName":"Wenjie","lastName":"Liu","id":"37085829480"},{"name":"Ping Huang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Virginia Commonwealth University, USA","Department of Computer and Information Sciences, Temple University, USA"],"firstName":"Ping","lastName":"Huang","id":"37085500630"},{"name":"Tang Kun","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Virginia Commonwealth University, USA","Department of Computer and Information Sciences, Temple University, USA"],"firstName":"Tang","lastName":"Kun","id":"37086191302"},{"name":"Tao Lu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Virginia Commonwealth University, USA"],"firstName":"Tao","lastName":"Lu","id":"37085353859"},{"name":"Ke Zhou","affiliation":["Wuhan National Lab for Optoelectronics, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, China"],"firstName":"Ke","lastName":"Zhou","id":"37306006200"},{"name":"Chunhua Li","affiliation":["Wuhan National Lab for Optoelectronics, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, China"],"firstName":"Chunhua","lastName":"Li","id":"37071580500"},{"name":"Xubin He","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Virginia Commonwealth University, USA","Department of Computer and Information Sciences, Temple University, USA"],"firstName":"Xubin","lastName":"He","id":"37085825881"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-5252-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-5251-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-5253-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2374-9628"}],"articleNumber":"7820660","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":339},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Random access memory","Scheduling","Memory architecture","Transistors","Parasitic capacitance","Processor scheduling","System performance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["buffer storage","DRAM chips"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["LAMS","latency-aware memory scheduling policy","DRAM systems","memory architecture","memory capacity","memory access latency","row-buffer hit classification","near-buffer classification","far-buffer classification","memory queuing time","FR-FCFS scheduler"]}],"abstract":"This paper introduces a new memory scheduling policy called LAMS, which is inspired by a recently proposed memory architecture and targets for future high capacity memory systems. As memory capacity increases, the bit-lines connected to memory row buffers become much longer, dramatically lengthening memory access latency, due to increased parasitic capacitance. Recent study has proposed to partition long bit-lines into near and far (relative to the row buffer) segments via inserting isolation transistors such that access to near segment can be accomplished much faster, while access to far segment remains nearly the same. However, how to effectively leverage the new memory architecture still remains unexplored. We suggest to take advantage of this new memory architecture via performing latency-aware memory scheduling for pending requests to explore their performance potentials. In this scheduling policy, each memory request is classified to one of the following three categories, row-buffer hit, near-buffer, and far-buffer. Based on the classification, it issues requests in the order of row-buffer hit \u2192 near-buffer \u2192 far-buffer. In doing so, it avoids long-latency requests blocking short-latency memory requests, reducing total memory queuing time in the memory controller and improving overall memory performance. Our evaluation results on a simulated memory system show that comparing with the commonly used FR-FCFS scheduler, our LAMS improves performance and energy efficiency by up to 20.6% and 34%, respectively. Even comparing with the four competitive schedulers chosen from memory scheduling champion (MSC), LAMS still improves performance and energy efficiency by up to 6.1% and 23.4%, respectively.","doi":"10.1109/PCCC.2016.7820660","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE 35th International Performance Computing and Communications Conference (IPCCC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE 35th International Performance Computing and Communications Conference (IPCCC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7803497/7820593/07820660.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7820593","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PCCC.2016.7820660","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"LAMS: A latency-aware memory scheduling policy for modern DRAM systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7820660","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-11 Dec. 2016","displayDocTitle":"LAMS: A latency-aware memory scheduling policy for modern DRAM systems","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7820660/","publicationDate":"Dec. 2016","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2017","accessionNumber":"16603378","htmlLink":"/document/7820660/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"9-11 Dec. 2016","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"LAMS: A latency-aware memory scheduling policy for modern DRAM systems","confLoc":"Las Vegas, NV, USA","sourcePdf":"Session903.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062167S","chronDate":"9-11 Dec. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7803497","isNumber":"7820593","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7803497","xplore-issue":"7820593","articleId":"7820660","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-21"},{"_id":7820664,"authors":[{"name":"Zhengyu Yang","affiliation":["Dept. of Electrical & Computer Engineering, Northeastern University, Boston, MA"],"firstName":"Zhengyu","lastName":"Yang","id":"37086002199"},{"name":"Jiayin Wang","affiliation":["Dept. of Computer Science, University of Massachusetts Boston, Boston, MA"],"firstName":"Jiayin","lastName":"Wang","id":"37085418891"},{"name":"David Evans","affiliation":["Samsung Semiconductor Inc., Storage Software Group, San Diego, CA"],"firstName":"David","lastName":"Evans","id":"37086113742"},{"name":"Ningfang Mi","affiliation":["Dept. of Electrical & Computer Engineering, Northeastern University, Boston, MA"],"firstName":"Ningfang","lastName":"Mi","id":"37603427400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-5252-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-5251-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-5253-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2374-9628"}],"articleNumber":"7820664","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":20,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":392},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Runtime","Data processing","Structural rings","Prefetching","Distributed databases","Performance evaluation","Cyber-physical systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cache storage","cyber-physical systems","fault tolerance","resource allocation","storage management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["AutoReplica","automatic data replica manager","distributed caching","data processing systems","data center storage systems","cyber-physical systems","CPS","I/O traffics","overall I/O performance","fault tolerance","SSD-HDD tier storages","cross-node replica structure","SLA","load balance","migrate-on-write technique","fusion cache","parallel prefetching","dynamic optimizing streaming technique","distributed caching systems"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Replica","Backup","Fault Tolerance","Device Failure Recovery","Distributed Storage System","Parallel I/O","SLA","Cache and Replacement Policy","Cluster Migration","VM Crash","Consistency","Atomicity"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7820664","abstract":"Nowadays, replication technique is widely used in data center storage systems for large scale Cyber-physical Systems (CPS) to prevent data loss. However, side-effect of replication is mainly the overhead of extra network and I/O traffics, which inevitably downgrades the overall I/O performance of the cluster. To effectively balance the trade-off between I/O performance and fault tolerance, in this paper, we propose a complete solution called \u201cAutoReplica\u201d - a replica manager in distributed caching and data processing systems with SSD-HDD tier storages. In detail, AutoReplica utilizes the remote SSDs (connected by high speed fibers) to replicate local SSD caches to protect data. In order to conduct load balancing among nodes and reduce the network overhead, we propose three approaches (i.e., ring, network, and multiple-SLA network) to automatically setup the cross-node replica structure with the consideration of network traffic, I/O speed and SLAs. To improve the performance during migrations triggered by load balance and failure recovery, we propose the a migrate-on-write technique called \u201cfusion cache\u201d to seamlessly migrate and prefetch among local and remote replicas without pausing the subsystem. Moreover, AutoReplica can also recover from different failure scenarios, while limits the performance downgrading degree. Lastly, AutoReplica supports parallel prefetching from multiple nodes with a new dynamic optimizing streaming technique to improve I/O performance. We are currently in the process of implementing AutoReplica to be easily plugged into commonly used distributed caching systems, and solidifying our design and implementation details.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7820593","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE 35th International Performance Computing and Communications Conference (IPCCC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE 35th International Performance Computing and Communications Conference (IPCCC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7803497/7820593/07820664.pdf","doi":"10.1109/PCCC.2016.7820664","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PCCC.2016.7820664","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"AutoReplica: Automatic data replica manager in distributed caching and data processing systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"9-11 Dec. 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7820664/","displayDocTitle":"AutoReplica: Automatic data replica manager in distributed caching and data processing systems","htmlLink":"/document/7820664/","conferenceDate":"9-11 Dec. 2016","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"16603373","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2017","publicationDate":"Dec. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"AutoReplica: Automatic data replica manager in distributed caching and data processing systems","confLoc":"Las Vegas, NV, USA","sourcePdf":"Workshop3.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.090401S","chronDate":"9-11 Dec. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7803497","isNumber":"7820593","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7803497","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"7820593","articleId":"7820664","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7820675,"authors":[{"name":"Qing Wang","affiliation":["University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, Anhui, China"],"firstName":"Qing","lastName":"Wang","id":"37085698245"},{"name":"Jun Du","affiliation":["University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, Anhui, China"],"firstName":"Jun","lastName":"Du","id":"37649186400"},{"name":"Li-Rong Dai","affiliation":["University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, Anhui, China"],"firstName":"Li-Rong","lastName":"Dai","id":"37273869000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-9-8814-7682-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2401-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7820675","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":153},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Speech","Speech enhancement","Signal to noise ratio","Noise measurement","Training","Feature extraction","Distortion"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feature extraction","learning (artificial intelligence)","speech enhancement","transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["DNN-based speech enhancement boosting","explicit transformations","DNN learning behaviors","linear transformations","logarithm transformations","amplitude spectra","log-power spectra","DNN parameters optimization","speech intelligibility improvement","feature concatenation"]}],"abstract":"In this study, we investigate on the learning behaviors of DNN by explicit feature transformations.

The input data of the network is the patches of images and the corresponding pixel-wise labels. A consecutive convolution layers and pooling layers follow the input data, so that the network can learn the abstract features to segment retinal vessel. Our network is designed to hold the height and width of data of each layer with padding and assign pooling stride so that the spatial information maintain and up-sample is not required. Compared with the pixel-wise retinal vessel segmentation approaches, our patch-wise segmentation is much more efficient since in each cycle it can predict all the pixels of the patch. Our overlapped SIFCN approach achieves accuracy of 0.9471, with the AUC of 0.9682. And our non-overlap SIFCN is the most efficient approach among the deep learning approaches, costing only 3.68 seconds per image, and the overlapped SIFCN costs 31.17 seconds per image.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7820677/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Dec. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"Dec. 2016","accessionNumber":"16602870","htmlLink":"/document/7820677/","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2017","conferenceDate":"13-16 Dec. 2016","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Size-Invariant Fully Convolutional Neural Network for vessel segmentation of digital retinal images","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Size-Invariant Fully Convolutional Neural Network for vessel segmentation of digital retinal images","confLoc":"Jeju, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"107.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.080227S","chronDate":"13-16 Dec. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7803478","isNumber":"7820670","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7803478","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"7820670","articleId":"7820677","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Asia Pacific Signal and Information Processing Association","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7820683,"authors":[{"name":"Yundong Ji","affiliation":["Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China"],"firstName":"Yundong","lastName":"Ji","id":"37086135618"},{"name":"Xiangeng Bu","affiliation":["Harbin Medical University, Harbin, Heilongjiang, CN"],"firstName":"Xiangeng","lastName":"Bu","id":"37087861270"},{"name":"Jinwei Sun","affiliation":["Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China"],"firstName":"Jinwei","lastName":"Sun","id":"37337375000"},{"name":"Zhiyong Liu","affiliation":["Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China"],"firstName":"Zhiyong","lastName":"Liu","id":"37085644565"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-9-8814-7682-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2401-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7820683","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":231},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Genetic algorithms","Sleep","Encoding","Simulated annealing","Convergence","Genetics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electroencephalography","feature extraction","genetic algorithms","medical signal processing","signal classification","simulated annealing","sleep"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["improved simulated annealing genetic algorithm","EEG feature selection","sleep stage","modeling parameters","optimization criterion","ISAGA","sleep EEG","MIT-BIH polysomnography database","classification accuracy","correlation coefficient algorithm","CCA","adaptive genetic algorithm","sleep staging"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7820683","abstract":"In order to establish a more reliable and robust EEG model in sleep stages, the reasonable choice of modeling parameters is necessary.

With the synthesized parallel corpus, a speech naturalness preference score of about 54.5% vs. 32.8% and a speech similarity preference score of about 52.5% vs. 23.6% are observed for the DNN-converted speech from the large parallel corpus when compared with the DNN-converted speech from the small parallel corpus.","doi":"10.1109/APSIPA.2016.7820716","publicationTitle":"2016 Asia-Pacific Signal and Information Processing Association Annual Summit and Conference (APSIPA)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 Asia-Pacific Signal and Information Processing Association Annual Summit and Conference (APSIPA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7803478/7820670/07820716.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APSIPA.2016.7820716","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7820670","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7820716","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Deep neural network based voice conversion with a large synthesized parallel corpus","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Dec. 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7820716/","displayDocTitle":"Deep neural network based voice conversion with a large synthesized parallel corpus","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7820716/","publicationDate":"Dec. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2017","conferenceDate":"13-16 Dec. 2016","accessionNumber":"16602865","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Deep neural network based voice conversion with a large synthesized parallel corpus","confLoc":"Jeju, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"154.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067095S","chronDate":"13-16 Dec. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7803478","isNumber":"7820670","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7803478","xplore-issue":"7820670","articleId":"7820716","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Asia Pacific Signal and Information Processing Association","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7820720,"authors":[{"name":"Hyunjun Eun","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST)"],"firstName":"Hyunjun","lastName":"Eun","id":"37085793046"},{"name":"Changick Kim","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST)"],"firstName":"Changick","lastName":"Kim","id":"37279785700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-9-8814-7682-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2401-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7820720","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":418},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Teeth","Proposals","Dentistry","X-ray imaging","Training","Image segmentation","Neural networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dentistry","medical image processing","neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["oriented tooth localization","periapical dental X-ray images","convolutional neural network","teeth separation lines","tooth localization method","CNN model"]}],"abstract":"In studies using dental X-ray images, tooth localization is essential to produce accurate results.

To classify each tooth proposal into either a tooth or a non-tooth, we utilize a convolutional neural network (CNN).

Experimental results on the AMI meeting transcription task shows that the BF network using SCM features significantly reduces the word error rate to 44.1% from 47.9% obtained with the conventional ASR pipeline using delay-and-sum BF. Also compared with GCC features, we have observed small but steady gain by 0.6% absolutely. The use of SCM features also facilitate the implementation of more advanced BF methods within a deep learning framework, such as minimum variance distortionless response BF that requires the speech and noise SCM.","doi":"10.1109/APSIPA.2016.7820724","publicationTitle":"2016 Asia-Pacific Signal and Information Processing Association Annual Summit and Conference (APSIPA)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 Asia-Pacific Signal and Information Processing Association Annual Summit and Conference (APSIPA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7803478/7820670/07820724.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APSIPA.2016.7820724","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7820670","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Beamforming networks using spatial covariance features for far-field speech recognition","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7820724","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Dec. 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7820724/","displayDocTitle":"Beamforming networks using spatial covariance features for far-field speech recognition","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2016","accessionNumber":"16602942","htmlLink":"/document/7820724/","conferenceDate":"13-16 Dec. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Beamforming networks using spatial covariance features for far-field speech recognition","confLoc":"Jeju, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"165.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.081451S","chronDate":"13-16 Dec. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7803478","isNumber":"7820670","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7803478","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"7820670","articleId":"7820724","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Asia Pacific Signal and Information Processing Association","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7820730,"authors":[{"name":"Yohei Kawaguchi","affiliation":["Research and Development Group, Hitachi Ltd., Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Yohei","lastName":"Kawaguchi","id":"37577190700"},{"name":"Masahito Togami","affiliation":["Research and Development Group, Hitachi Ltd., Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Masahito","lastName":"Togami","id":"37569544400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-9-8814-7682-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2401-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7820730","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":40},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Compressed sensing","Coherence","Redundancy","Testing","Linear programming","Matching pursuit algorithms","Artificial intelligence"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive signal processing","Boolean algebra","compressed sensing","matrix algebra","probability","redundancy"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive boolean compressive sensing","sequential pool-design","Bernoulli random design","mixing matrix redundancy","exact recovery probability","mutual coherence evaluation","linear problem"]}],"abstract":"A new method for solving adaptive Boolean compressive sensing is proposed.

To avoid the high redundancy, the proposed method decides the pool sequentially by evaluating the mutual coherence at every test.

We rely on a key assumption that two speakers could be well segregated if they are not too similar to each other. A dissimilarity measure between two speakers is then proposed to characterize the separation ability between competing speakers. We demonstrate that the distance between speakers of different genders is large enough to warrant a possible separation. We finally propose a DNN architecture with dual outputs, one representing the female speaker group and the other characterizing the male speaker group. Trained and tested on the Speech Separation Challenge corpus our experimental results show that the proposed DNN approach achieves large performance gains over the state-of-the-art unsupervised techniques without using specific knowledge about the mixed target and interfering speakers and even outperforms the supervised GMM-based method.","doi":"10.1109/APSIPA.2016.7820736","publicationTitle":"2016 Asia-Pacific Signal and Information Processing Association Annual Summit and Conference (APSIPA)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 Asia-Pacific Signal and Information Processing Association Annual Summit and Conference (APSIPA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7803478/7820670/07820736.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APSIPA.2016.7820736","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7820670","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7820736","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Unsupervised single-channel speech separation via deep neural network for different gender mixtures","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Dec. 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7820736/","displayDocTitle":"Unsupervised single-channel speech separation via deep neural network for different gender mixtures","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7820736/","publicationDate":"Dec. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2017","conferenceDate":"13-16 Dec. 2016","accessionNumber":"16602794","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Unsupervised single-channel speech separation via deep neural network for different gender mixtures","confLoc":"Jeju, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"178.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.104627S","chronDate":"13-16 Dec. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7803478","isNumber":"7820670","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7803478","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"7820670","articleId":"7820736","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Asia Pacific Signal and Information Processing Association","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7820738,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaohai Tian","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Engineering, Nanyang Technological University (NTU), Singapore"],"firstName":"Xiaohai","lastName":"Tian","id":"37085617130"},{"name":"Xiong Xiao","affiliation":["Temasek Laboratories, NTU, Singapore"],"firstName":"Xiong","lastName":"Xiao","id":"37649822500"},{"name":"Eng Siong Chng","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Engineering, Nanyang Technological University (NTU), Singapore"],"firstName":"Eng Siong","lastName":"Chng","id":"37584925600"},{"name":"Haizhou Li","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, National University of Singapore","School of Computer Science and Engineering, Nanyang Technological University (NTU), Singapore"],"firstName":"Haizhou","lastName":"Li","id":"37407157000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-9-8814-7682-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2401-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7820738","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":448},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Speech","Feature extraction","Convolution","Natural languages","Neural networks","Vocoders","Trajectory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feature extraction","feedforward neural nets","filters","security of data","signal classification","speech recognition","voice activity detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["unit selection","synthetic speech detection","ASVspoof 2015 corpus","max-pooling layer","time window","maximum response extraction","feature trajectories","temporal CNN based classifier","temporal convolutional neural network","spoofing speech detection"]}],"abstract":"Spoofing speech detection aims to differentiate spoofing speech from natural speech. Frame-based features are usually used in most of previous works. Although multiple frames or dynamic features are used to form a super-vector to represent the temporal information, the time span covered by these features are not sufficient. Most of the systems failed to detect the non-vocoder or unit selection based spoofing attacks. In this work, we propose to use a temporal convolutional neural network (CNN) based classifier for spoofing speech detection. The temporal CNN first convolves the feature trajectories with a set of filters, then extract the maximum responses of these filters within a time window using a max-pooling layer. Due to the use of max-pooling, we can extract useful information from a long temporal span without concatenating a large number of neighbouring frames, as in feedforward deep neural network (DNN). Five types of feature are employed to access the performance of proposed classifier. Experimental results on ASVspoof 2015 corpus show that the temporal CNN based classifier is effective for synthetic speech detection. Specifically, the proposed method brings a significant performance boost for the unit selection based spoofing speech detection.","doi":"10.1109/APSIPA.2016.7820738","publicationTitle":"2016 Asia-Pacific Signal and Information Processing Association Annual Summit and Conference (APSIPA)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 Asia-Pacific Signal and Information Processing Association Annual Summit and Conference (APSIPA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7803478/7820670/07820738.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APSIPA.2016.7820738","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7820670","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7820738","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Spoofing speech detection using temporal convolutional neural network","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Dec. 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7820738/","displayDocTitle":"Spoofing speech detection using temporal convolutional neural network","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7820738/","publicationDate":"Dec. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2017","conferenceDate":"13-16 Dec. 2016","accessionNumber":"16602805","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spoofing speech detection using temporal convolutional neural network","confLoc":"Jeju, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"180.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.084997S","chronDate":"13-16 Dec. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7803478","isNumber":"7820670","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7803478","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"7820670","articleId":"7820738","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Asia Pacific Signal and Information Processing Association","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7820741,"authors":[{"name":"Qiyu Chen","affiliation":["South China University of Technology, GuangZhou, China"],"firstName":"Qiyu","lastName":"Chen","id":"37086117952"},{"name":"Weibin Zhang","affiliation":["South China University of Technology, GuangZhou, China"],"firstName":"Weibin","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37086044212"},{"name":"Xiang Tian","affiliation":["South China University of Technology, GuangZhou, China"],"firstName":"Xiang","lastName":"Tian","id":"37086155684"},{"name":"Xiaoxue Zhang","affiliation":["Guangdong No.2 Provincial People's Hospital, Guangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Xiaoxue","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37086156607"},{"name":"Shaoqiong Chen","affiliation":["South China University of Technology, GuangZhou, China"],"firstName":"Shaoqiong","lastName":"Chen","id":"37086156800"},{"name":"Wenkang Lei","affiliation":["South China University of Technology, GuangZhou, China"],"firstName":"Wenkang","lastName":"Lei","id":"37086152515"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-9-8814-7682-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2401-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7820741","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":592},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Automatic heart and lung sounds classification using convolutional neural networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7820741","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Heart","Lungs","Convolution","Diseases","Kernel","Training"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["acoustic signal processing","bioacoustics","diseases","lung","medical disorders","medical signal processing","neural nets","pneumodynamics","signal classification"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["automatic heart","lung sound classification","convolutional neural networks","abnormal heart sound","respiratory diseases","heart diseases","automatic diagnostic method","CNNs based systems","bruit de galop","mitral inadequacy","mitral stenosis","interventricular septal defect","aortic incompetence","aorta stenosis","moist rales","wheezing rale","data set collection"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["heart sound classification","lung sound classification","Convolutional Neural Networks"]}],"abstract":"We study the effectiveness of using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to automatically detect abnormal heart and lung sounds and classify them into different classes in this paper.

Many successful ANC systems have adopted the feedforward filtered-x least mean squares (FxLMS) algorithm to reduce machinery noise. The noise canceling headset is another well known example, where the feedback control structure is favorable due to the small size. However, the feedback control structure is incapable of reducing broad band noise. Therefore, this paper investigates the feasibility of implementing the feedforward FxLMS algorithm in the noise canceling headset.

In this paper, we proposed a note-based QBH system which apply the hidden Markov model and dynamic programming to find the most possible song. Also, we proposed several techniques to improve the QBH system performance. First, we propose a modified method for onset detection. The frequency information is also used in this part By time-frequency analysis, we can find out the onset points which are difficult to be picked up in the time domain. Besides the pitch feature, the beat information and possible pitch and humming errors are also considered for melody matching. The tempo feature is also an important part for a song. Even though the pitch sequences of two songs are the same, if the tempo is clearly different, then they are complete different songs. Also the possible singing errors are considered. Simulations show that the performance can be much improved by our proposed methods.","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 Asia-Pacific Signal and Information Processing Association Annual Summit and Conference (APSIPA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7803478/7820670/07820765.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","publicationTitle":"2016 Asia-Pacific Signal and Information Processing Association Annual Summit and Conference (APSIPA)","doi":"10.1109/APSIPA.2016.7820765","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APSIPA.2016.7820765","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7820670","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7820765","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Advanced query by humming system using diffused hidden Markov model and tempo based dynamic programming","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hidden Markov models","Matched filters","Dynamic programming","Time-domain analysis","Feature extraction","Convolution","System performance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["content-based retrieval","dynamic programming","hidden Markov models","time-frequency analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["query by humming system","diffused hidden Markov model","tempo based dynamic programming","QBH","content-based system","time-frequency analysis","pitch feature","beat information","pitch sequences"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7820765/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Dec. 2016","displayDocTitle":"Advanced query by humming system using diffused hidden Markov model and tempo based dynamic programming","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7820765/","publicationDate":"Dec. 2016","accessionNumber":"16603001","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2017","conferenceDate":"13-16 Dec. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Advanced query by humming system using diffused hidden Markov model and tempo based dynamic programming","confLoc":"Jeju, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"208.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062514S","chronDate":"13-16 Dec. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7803478","isNumber":"7820670","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7803478","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7820670","articleId":"7820765","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Asia Pacific Signal and Information Processing Association","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7820779,"authors":[{"name":"Naoki Morikawa","affiliation":["Tokyo University of Agriculture and Technology, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Naoki","lastName":"Morikawa","id":"37074048600"},{"name":"Toshihisa Tanaka","affiliation":["Tokyo University of Agriculture and Technology, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Toshihisa","lastName":"Tanaka","id":"37277535000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-9-8814-7682-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2401-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7820779","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":141},"abstract":"A brain-computer interface (BCI) based on steady state visual evoked potentials (SSVEPs) is one of the most practical BCI, because of high recognition accuracies and short time training. To increase the number of commands of SSVEP-based BCI, recently a frequency and phase mixed-coded SSVEP BCI has been proposed. However, in order to detect frequency and phase of SSVEPs accurately, it is required to treat multi-channel phases to select useful channels for detecting commands. In this paper, we propose a novel method for estimating both frequency and phase of SSVEPs with sparse complex spatial filters. We conducted experiments for evaluating the performance of the proposed method in a mixed-coded SSVEP based BCI. As a result, the proposed method showed higher recognition accuracies and lower calculation cost of command detection than conventional methods. Moreover, the proposed method achieved automatic channel selection.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Electroencephalography","Visualization","Phase frequency detector","Liquid crystal displays","Training","Harmonic analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["brain-computer interfaces","compressed sensing","electroencephalography","spatial filters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["sparse spatial filtering","frequency domain","multichannel EEG","frequency detection","phase detection","brain-computer interface","steady state visual evoked potential","phase mixed-coded SSVEP BCI","multichannel phases","automatic channel selection"]}],"doi":"10.1109/APSIPA.2016.7820779","publicationTitle":"2016 Asia-Pacific Signal and Information Processing Association Annual Summit and Conference (APSIPA)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 Asia-Pacific Signal and Information Processing Association Annual Summit and Conference (APSIPA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7803478/7820670/07820779.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7820670","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APSIPA.2016.7820779","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sparse spatial filtering in frequency domain of multi-channel EEG for frequency and phase detection","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7820779","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Sparse spatial filtering in frequency domain of multi-channel EEG for frequency and phase detection","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7820779/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7820779/","accessionNumber":"16602868","conferenceDate":"13-16 Dec. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Dec. 2016","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sparse spatial filtering in frequency domain of multi-channel EEG for frequency and phase detection","confLoc":"Jeju, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"223.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.083307S","chronDate":"13-16 Dec. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7803478","isNumber":"7820670","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7803478","xplore-issue":"7820670","articleId":"7820779","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Asia Pacific Signal and Information Processing Association","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7820785,"authors":[{"name":"Wei Li","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Technology, Shandong University, China"],"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Li","id":"37089090565"},{"name":"Jingliang Peng","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Technology, Shandong University, China"],"firstName":"Jingliang","lastName":"Peng","id":"37422840200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-9-8814-7682-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2401-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7820785","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":128},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7820785","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Gait recognition","Dictionaries","Training","Feature extraction","Face recognition","Principal component analysis","Legged locomotion"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["learning (artificial intelligence)","object recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["gait recognition","single sample per person","generic training set","sparse variation dictionary","sparse representation","CASIA gait database"]}],"abstract":"Gait recognition with a single sample per person (SSPP) is a challenging problem but has so far drawn little research attention.

We learn a sparse variation dictionary from the generic training set by connecting the generic training set with the gallery set adaptively. The sparse variation dictionary is then integrated into the framework of sparse representation based classification so that various variations in clothing, object carrying and so forth can be better addressed.

Many SC frameworks require parallel corpora, phonetic alignments, or explicit frame-wise correspondence for learning conversion functions or for synthesizing a target spectrum with the aid of alignments. However, these requirements gravely limit the scope of practical applications of SC due to scarcity or even unavailability of parallel corpora. We propose an SC framework based on variational auto-encoder which enables us to exploit non-parallel corpora. The framework comprises an encoder that learns speaker-independent phonetic representations and a decoder that learns to reconstruct the designated speaker. It removes the requirement of parallel corpora or phonetic alignments to train a spectral conversion system. We report objective and subjective evaluations to validate our proposed method and compare it to SC methods that have access to aligned corpora.","doi":"10.1109/APSIPA.2016.7820786","publicationTitle":"2016 Asia-Pacific Signal and Information Processing Association Annual Summit and Conference (APSIPA)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 Asia-Pacific Signal and Information Processing Association Annual Summit and Conference (APSIPA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7803478/7820670/07820786.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APSIPA.2016.7820786","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7820670","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Voice conversion from non-parallel corpora using variational auto-encoder","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7820786","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Voice conversion from non-parallel corpora using variational auto-encoder","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Dec. 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7820786/","conferenceDate":"13-16 Dec. 2016","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2016","accessionNumber":"16602806","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7820786/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Voice conversion from non-parallel corpora using variational auto-encoder","confLoc":"Jeju, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"231.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.075753S","chronDate":"13-16 Dec. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7803478","isNumber":"7820670","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7803478","citationCount":"65","xplore-issue":"7820670","articleId":"7820786","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Asia Pacific Signal and Information Processing Association","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7820788,"authors":[{"name":"Motoi Shibata","affiliation":["College of Information Science and Engineering, Ritsumeikan University, Kusatsu, Japan"],"firstName":"Motoi","lastName":"Shibata","id":"37086008328"},{"name":"Norihito Inamuro","affiliation":["College of Information Science and Engineering, Ritsumeikan University, Kusatsu, Japan"],"firstName":"Norihito","lastName":"Inamuro","id":"37085355825"},{"name":"Takashi Ijiri","affiliation":["College of Information Science and Engineering, Ritsumeikan University, Kusatsu, Japan"],"firstName":"Takashi","lastName":"Ijiri","id":"37086011483"},{"name":"Akira Hirabayashi","affiliation":["College of Information Science and Engineering, Ritsumeikan University, Kusatsu, Japan"],"firstName":"Akira","lastName":"Hirabayashi","id":"37587667900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-9-8814-7682-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2401-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7820788","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":144},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High accuracy reconstruction algorithm for CS-MRI using SDMM","abstract":"We propose a high accuracy algorithm for compressed sensing magnetic resonance imaging (CS-MRI) using a convex optimization technique.

In this paper, we propose an algorithm that obtains the exact solution based on the simultaneous direction method of multipliers (SDMM), which is one of the convex optimization techniques. A simple application of SDMM to CS-MRI cannot be implemented because the transformation matrix size is proportional to the square of the image size.

In this paper, we evaluate impacts of parameter settings on the DOA estimation performance and find quasi optimum values for the parameters.","doi":"10.1109/APSIPA.2016.7820797","publicationTitle":"2016 Asia-Pacific Signal and Information Processing Association Annual Summit and Conference (APSIPA)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 Asia-Pacific Signal and Information Processing Association Annual Summit and Conference (APSIPA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7803478/7820670/07820797.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APSIPA.2016.7820797","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7820670","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Parameter settings on DOA estimation of multi-band signals using a compressed sensing technique","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7820797","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Parameter settings on DOA estimation of multi-band signals using a compressed sensing technique","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Dec. 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7820797/","conferenceDate":"13-16 Dec. 2016","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2016","accessionNumber":"16602812","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7820797/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Parameter settings on DOA estimation of multi-band signals using a compressed sensing technique","confLoc":"Jeju, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"243.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.088514S","chronDate":"13-16 Dec. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7803478","isNumber":"7820670","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7803478","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7820670","articleId":"7820797","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Asia Pacific Signal and Information Processing Association","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7820807,"authors":[{"name":"Hirotaka Mukumoto","affiliation":["Graduate School of Informatics, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan"],"firstName":"Hirotaka","lastName":"Mukumoto","id":"37086182278"},{"name":"Kazunori Hayashi","affiliation":["Graduate School of Informatics, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan"],"firstName":"Kazunori","lastName":"Hayashi","id":"37277906800"},{"name":"Megumi Kaneko","affiliation":["National Institute of Informatics, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Megumi","lastName":"Kaneko","id":"37400086400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-9-8814-7682-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2401-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7820807","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":255},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multiple signal classification","Direction-of-arrival estimation","Sensor arrays","Compressed sensing","Estimation","Correlation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","compressed sensing","direction-of-arrival estimation","signal classification"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["KR product array processing","noiseless observation","incoming waves","MUSIC algorithm","multiple signal classification algorithm","compressed sensing","Khatri-Rao subspace","DOA estimation scheme","direction-of-arrival estimation"]}],"abstract":"Direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation via Khatri-Rao (KR) subspace with multiple signal classification (MUSIC) algorithm can cope with a higher number of incoming waves than that of sensors, while it requires the signals to be quasi-stationary and needs a larger number of \u201cframes\u201d than that of incoming waves. On the other hand, a hybrid approach of compressed sensing and MUSIC algorithm can estimate DOAs with snapshots less than the number of sources for noiseless observation, although the number of incoming waves must be less than that of sensors. Exploiting the fact that the frame in MUSIC via KR subspace corresponds to the snapshot in conventional MUSIC without observation noise, we propose a DOA estimation scheme using KR product array processing and compressed sensing, which can cope with a greater number of incoming waves than both that of sensors and that of frames. The validity of the proposed method is shown via numerical experiments.","doi":"10.1109/APSIPA.2016.7820807","publicationTitle":"2016 Asia-Pacific Signal and Information Processing Association Annual Summit and Conference (APSIPA)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 Asia-Pacific Signal and Information Processing Association Annual Summit and Conference (APSIPA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7803478/7820670/07820807.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APSIPA.2016.7820807","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7820670","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Direction-of-arrival estimation via Khatri-Rao subspace using compressed sensing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7820807","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Dec. 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7820807/","displayDocTitle":"Direction-of-arrival estimation via Khatri-Rao subspace using compressed sensing","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2016","accessionNumber":"16603015","htmlLink":"/document/7820807/","conferenceDate":"13-16 Dec. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Direction-of-arrival estimation via Khatri-Rao subspace using compressed sensing","confLoc":"Jeju, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"253.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048944S","chronDate":"13-16 Dec. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7803478","isNumber":"7820670","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7803478","xplore-issue":"7820670","articleId":"7820807","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Asia Pacific Signal and Information Processing Association","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7820809,"authors":[{"name":"Takazumi Asai","affiliation":["Nagaoka University of Technology, JAPAN"],"firstName":"Takazumi","lastName":"Asai","id":"37085628209"},{"name":"Tomohiro Yendo","affiliation":["Nagaoka University of Technology, JAPAN"],"firstName":"Tomohiro","lastName":"Yendo","id":"37321487300"},{"name":"Shintaro Arai","affiliation":["Kagawa College, National Institute of Technology"],"firstName":"Shintaro","lastName":"Arai","id":"37530262200"},{"name":"Takaya Yamazato","affiliation":["Nagoya University"],"firstName":"Takaya","lastName":"Yamazato","id":"37270510400"},{"name":"Hiraku Okada","affiliation":["Nagoya University"],"firstName":"Hiraku","lastName":"Okada","id":"37085346473"},{"name":"Toshiaki Fujii","affiliation":["Kagawa College, National Institute of Technology"],"firstName":"Toshiaki","lastName":"Fujii","id":"37277000000"},{"name":"Koji Kamakura","affiliation":["Chiba Institute of Technology"],"firstName":"Koji","lastName":"Kamakura","id":"37268378500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-9-8814-7682-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2401-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7820809","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":325},"abstract":"We focus on the road-to-vehicle visible light communication (VLC) that system is composed of a LED matrix as a transmitter and a high-speed camera as a receiver. In this VLC system, intensity of each LED cannot be determined from received image directly in case that the receiver is distant from the transmitter. In previous research, a method to estimate intensity of the LED from received image is proposed. In this method, intensity of LED is estimated by using Moore-Penrose pseudo-inverse matrix of coefficient matrix, which expresses relation between intensity of LEDs and pixel values. However, the coefficient matrix changes every moment because it is determined by positional relation between the receiver and the LED traffic light in VLC system. In this paper, we propose a method to estimate position of the LED matrix using simulated images. We measure sensitivity distribution of image sensor to generate simulated images. We evaluated degree of similarity between simulated images and real images.","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 Asia-Pacific Signal and Information Processing Association Annual Summit and Conference (APSIPA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7803478/7820670/07820809.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","publicationTitle":"2016 Asia-Pacific Signal and Information Processing Association Annual Summit and Conference (APSIPA)","doi":"10.1109/APSIPA.2016.7820809","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APSIPA.2016.7820809","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7820670","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7820809","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Position estimation of LED matrix in image sensor communication","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Light emitting diodes","Receivers","Image sensors","Optical transmitters","Cameras","Mathematical model"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cameras","free-space optical communication","image sensors","light emitting diodes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["position estimation","LED matrix","image sensor communication","road-to-vehicle visible light communication","Moore-Penrose pseudo-inverse matrix","coefficient matrix","sensitivity distribution"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Intelligent Transport System","Visible Light Communication","High-speed camera","LED traffic light"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7820809/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Dec. 2016","displayDocTitle":"Position estimation of LED matrix in image sensor communication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7820809/","publicationDate":"Dec. 2016","accessionNumber":"16602808","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2017","conferenceDate":"13-16 Dec. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Position estimation of LED matrix in image sensor communication","confLoc":"Jeju, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"255.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069092S","chronDate":"13-16 Dec. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7803478","isNumber":"7820670","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7803478","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7820670","articleId":"7820809","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Asia Pacific Signal and Information Processing Association","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7820811,"authors":[{"name":"Yuechi Cao","affiliation":["Graduate School of Informatics, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan"],"firstName":"Yuechi","lastName":"Cao","id":"37086166686"},{"name":"Kazunori Hayashi","affiliation":["Graduate School of Informatics, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan"],"firstName":"Kazunori","lastName":"Hayashi","id":"37277906800"},{"name":"Fanggang Wang","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Rail Traffic Control and Safety, Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Fanggang","lastName":"Wang","id":"37085807824"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-9-8814-7682-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2401-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7820811","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":55},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Relays","Unicast","Optimization","Uncertainty","Downlink","Antennas","Network coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","channel coding","iterative methods","least mean squares methods","MIMO communication","network coding","relay networks (telecommunication)","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["arbitrary unicast transmission","MIMO multiway relay channel","imperfect channel state information","perfect CSI","relay station","multiple antennas","network coding","minimum mean square error","MMSE-based optimization","relay power constraint","iterative algorithm"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we investigate the design of relay processing for arbitrary unicast transmission over a multi-way relay channel, where each user employing a single antenna communicates with the other user via a relay station having multiple antennas.

In order to realize the confidentiality and integrity of speech content stored in the cloud, an efficient watermarking based on integer wavelet transform in encrypted domain is proposed. Firstly, the original speech is scrambled by chaotic mapping. Then, the integer wavelet approximate components of each scrambled speech frame are encrypted by block cipher. Subsequently, the encrypted components are used to generate watermark which is embedded into the detail components. The process of watermark extraction and authentication is responsible for detecting attacks and locating tampered area. The extracted watermark is used for self-synchronization and tampering detection simultaneously. Theoretical analysis and simulation results show that the proposed watermarking has high security, better inaudibility and strong ability to locate the tampered area.","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 Asia-Pacific Signal and Information Processing Association Annual Summit and Conference (APSIPA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7803478/7820670/07820814.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","publicationTitle":"2016 Asia-Pacific Signal and Information Processing Association Annual Summit and Conference (APSIPA)","doi":"10.1109/APSIPA.2016.7820814","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APSIPA.2016.7820814","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7820670","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7820814","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An efficient content authentication scheme in encrypted speech based on integer wavelet transform","keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","cryptography","data integrity","speech processing","watermarking","wavelet transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["content authentication scheme","encrypted speech","integer wavelet transform","cloud storage","speech content confidentiality","speech content integrity","chaotic mapping","integer wavelet approximate components","scrambled speech frame","block cipher","watermark extraction","watermark authentication","self-synchronization","tampering detection"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7820814/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Dec. 2016","displayDocTitle":"An efficient content authentication scheme in encrypted speech based on integer wavelet transform","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7820814/","publicationDate":"Dec. 2016","accessionNumber":"16602950","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2017","conferenceDate":"13-16 Dec. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An efficient content authentication scheme in encrypted speech based on integer wavelet transform","confLoc":"Jeju, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"26.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.084239S","chronDate":"13-16 Dec. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7803478","isNumber":"7820670","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7803478","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7820670","articleId":"7820814","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Asia Pacific Signal and Information Processing Association","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7820816,"authors":[{"name":"Kota Horiuchi","affiliation":["Graduate School of Science and Tech., Niigata University, Niigata, Japan"],"firstName":"Kota","lastName":"Horiuchi","id":"37086129986"},{"name":"Shogo Muramatsu","affiliation":["Dept of Electrical and Electronic Eng., Niigata University, Niigata, Japan"],"firstName":"Shogo","lastName":"Muramatsu","id":"37264864100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-9-8814-7682-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2401-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7820816","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":50},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fast convolution technique for non-separable oversampled lapped transforms","abstract":"In this study, an acceleration technique for non-separable oversampled lapped transforms (NSOLT) is proposed.

Recently, deep neural networks (DNNs) have significantly improved the performance of SPSS. However, current studies are mainly focusing on the training of speaker-dependent DNNs, which generally requires a significant amount of data from a single speaker. In this work, we perform a systematic analysis of the training of multi-speaker average voice model (AVM), which is the foundation of adaptability and controllability of a DNN-based speech synthesis system. Specifically, we employ the i-vector framework to factorise the speaker specific information, which allows a variety of speakers to share all the hidden layers. And the speaker identity vector is augmented with linguistic features in the DNN input. We systematically analyse the impact of the implementations of i-vectors and speaker normalisation.","doi":"10.1109/APSIPA.2016.7820818","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APSIPA.2016.7820818","publicationTitle":"2016 Asia-Pacific Signal and Information Processing Association Annual Summit and Conference (APSIPA)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 Asia-Pacific Signal and Information Processing Association Annual Summit and Conference (APSIPA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7803478/7820670/07820818.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7820670","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7820818/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Dec. 2016","displayDocTitle":"On the training of DNN-based average voice model for speech synthesis","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"13-16 Dec. 2016","accessionNumber":"16602915","htmlLink":"/document/7820818/","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2017","publicationDate":"Dec. 2016","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the training of DNN-based average voice model for speech synthesis","confLoc":"Jeju, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"266.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072992S","chronDate":"13-16 Dec. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7803478","isNumber":"7820670","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7803478","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"7820670","articleId":"7820818","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Asia Pacific Signal and Information Processing Association","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7820820,"authors":[{"name":"Yingming Gao","affiliation":["College of Information Sciences, Beijing Language and Culture University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yingming","lastName":"Gao","id":"37086071525"},{"name":"Yanlu Xie","affiliation":["College of Information Sciences, Beijing Language and Culture University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yanlu","lastName":"Xie","id":"37078188300"},{"name":"Ju Lin","affiliation":["College of Information Sciences, Beijing Language and Culture University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Ju","lastName":"Lin","id":"37086001742"},{"name":"Jinsong Zhang","affiliation":["College of Information Sciences, Beijing Language and Culture University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Jinsong","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37086192061"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-9-8814-7682-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2401-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7820820","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":61},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7820820","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Feature extraction","Training","Hidden Markov models","Mel frequency cepstral coefficient","Speech","Training data"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feature extraction","Gaussian processes","hidden Markov models","mixture models","neural nets","speech recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["DNN based detection","pronunciation erroneous tendency","data sparse condition","computer aided pronunciation training systems","feature extraction","articulatory features","bottleneck features","middle hidden layer"]}],"abstract":"Detecting pronunciation erroneous tendency (PET) can provide second languages learners with detailedly instructive feedbacks in the computer aided pronunciation training (CAPT) systems. Due to the data sparseness, DNN-HMM achieved limited improvement over GMM-HMM in our previous work. Instead of directly employing DNN-HMM to detect PETs, this paper investigated how to further improve the performance by DNN based features extracting in data sparse condition. Firstly, the probabilities of articulatory features derived from the top layer of DNN were fed into DNN-HMM. Secondly, the bottleneck features (BNF) extracted from the middle hidden layer were incorporated with original MFCC and then fed into SGMM-HMM. The experimental results showed that the new features converted from original acoustic features with DNN were more discriminative, and SGMM with BNF outperformed DNN in detecting PETs. The SGMM-HMM obtained the best detection results, achieving FRR of 5.3%, FAR of 29.6% and DA of 90%.","publicationTitle":"2016 Asia-Pacific Signal and Information Processing Association Annual Summit and Conference (APSIPA)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 Asia-Pacific Signal and Information Processing Association Annual Summit and Conference (APSIPA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7803478/7820670/07820820.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APSIPA.2016.7820820","doi":"10.1109/APSIPA.2016.7820820","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7820670","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"DNN based detection of pronunciation erroneous tendency in data sparse condition","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"DNN based detection of pronunciation erroneous tendency in data sparse condition","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7820820/","conferenceDate":"13-16 Dec. 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7820820/","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2017","publicationDate":"Dec. 2016","accessionNumber":"16602875","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Dec. 2016","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"DNN based detection of pronunciation erroneous tendency in data sparse condition","confLoc":"Jeju, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"268.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.080912S","chronDate":"13-16 Dec. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7803478","isNumber":"7820670","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7803478","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7820670","articleId":"7820820","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Asia Pacific Signal and Information Processing Association","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7820822,"authors":[{"name":"Yanbin Zou","affiliation":["University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Yanbin","lastName":"Zou","id":"37085849317"},{"name":"Qun Wan","affiliation":["University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, CN"],"firstName":"Qun","lastName":"Wan","id":"37273394600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-9-8814-7682-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2401-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7820822","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":188},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Transmitters","Receivers","MIMO radar","Algorithm design and analysis","Estimation","Noise measurement","MIMO"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["least squares approximations","mathematical programming","MIMO radar"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["moving target localization","noncoherent distributed MIMO radar systems","bistatic range","range rate measurements","weighted least squares method","semidefinite programming method"]}],"abstract":"This paper considers the problem of moving target localization in noncoherent distributed multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) radar systems by using the bistatic range and range rate measurements.

We first show that by adopting a linear activation function at the output layer and globally normalizing the target features into zero mean and unit variance, better performances can be obtained than existing DNN approaches. Then we show that the quality of dereverberated speech could be degraded with denser sampling in time for longer reverberation times, even at the price of increased computational complexities, requiring an adaptive time sampling strategy. On the other hand, the difference between the unwrapped phases of reverberant and anechoic speech becomes negligible with a dense sampling in frequency, implying a reduced speech distortion. Therefore, there is a great potential to enhance DNN based acoustic signal processing if the conventional sampling strategy can be carefully adjusted.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7820830/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Dec. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"Dec. 2016","accessionNumber":"16602858","htmlLink":"/document/7820830/","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2017","conferenceDate":"13-16 Dec. 2016","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A study on sampling of STFT modifications in time and frequency domains for DNN-based speech dereverberation","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A study on sampling of STFT modifications in time and frequency domains for DNN-based speech dereverberation","confLoc":"Jeju, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"28.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.076142S","chronDate":"13-16 Dec. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7803478","isNumber":"7820670","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7803478","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7820670","articleId":"7820830","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Asia Pacific Signal and Information Processing Association","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7820831,"authors":[{"name":"Tetsuya Hashimoto","affiliation":["Graduate School of Engineering, The University of Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Tetsuya","lastName":"Hashimoto","id":"37086182935"},{"name":"Daisuke Saito","affiliation":["Graduate School of Information Science and Technology, The University of Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Daisuke","lastName":"Saito","id":"37604219600"},{"name":"Nobuaki Minematsu","affiliation":["Graduate School of Engineering, The University of Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Nobuaki","lastName":"Minematsu","id":"37274034300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-9-8814-7682-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2401-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7820831","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":104},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Training","Speech","Neural networks","Adaptation models","Distortion","Covariance matrices","Mathematical model"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neural nets","speech processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["arbitrary speaker conversion","speaker space bases constructed by","deep neural networks","voice conversion system","DNN","speaker eigenspace","eigenvoice GMM"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7820831","abstract":"This paper proposes a novel approach to construct a Deep Neural Network (DNN) based voice conversion (VC) system, where DNNs are integrated with speaker eigenspace.

The posterior probabilities of \u201csenones\u201d populated in a decision tree are trained and predicted speaker independently. Acoustic features of each input segment (with preceding and succeeding contexts of several frames) are mapped unto the whole set of senones in their corresponding posteriors. Vectors of senone posteriors are used as stochastic characterization of input speech segments in the phonetic space. Distortion between any two such vectors are measured with the symmetric Kullback-Leibler Divergence (KLD) and they are used for performing vector clustering and computing the corresponding centroids in a phonetically oriented senone based decision tree. Experimental results, tested on a large, Mandarin database (iCALL) of L2 language learners, show that the proposed approach to mispronunciation detection can achieve a 3.0% of equal precision and recall improvement over our best DNN-based, Goodness of Pronunciation (GOP) baseline system with adaptation. When the original maximum-likelihood trained decision tree is retrained with the symmetric KLD measure, further improvement of 0.8% of equal precision and recall can be obtained.","doi":"10.1109/APSIPA.2016.7820849","publicationTitle":"2016 Asia-Pacific Signal and Information Processing Association Annual Summit and Conference (APSIPA)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 Asia-Pacific Signal and Information Processing Association Annual Summit and Conference (APSIPA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7803478/7820670/07820849.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APSIPA.2016.7820849","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7820670","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7820849","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"KL-divergence based mispronunciation detection via DNN and decision tree in the phonetic space","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Dec. 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7820849/","displayDocTitle":"KL-divergence based mispronunciation detection via DNN and decision tree in the phonetic space","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7820849/","publicationDate":"Dec. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2017","conferenceDate":"13-16 Dec. 2016","accessionNumber":"16602908","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"KL-divergence based mispronunciation detection via DNN and decision tree in the phonetic space","confLoc":"Jeju, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"298.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064118S","chronDate":"13-16 Dec. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7803478","isNumber":"7820670","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7803478","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7820670","articleId":"7820849","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Asia Pacific Signal and Information Processing Association","lastupdate":"2021-09-28"},{"_id":7820854,"authors":[{"name":"Yuuki Tachioka","affiliation":["Information Technology R&D Center, Mitsubishi Electric Corporation, Kamakura, Kanagawa, Japan"],"firstName":"Yuuki","lastName":"Tachioka","id":"37077374000"},{"name":"Tomohiro Narita","affiliation":["Information Technology R&D Center, Mitsubishi Electric Corporation, Kamakura, Kanagawa, Japan"],"firstName":"Tomohiro","lastName":"Narita","id":"37086192785"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-9-8814-7682-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2401-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7820854","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":86},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Speech","Training","Decoding","Signal to noise ratio","Feature extraction","Speech enhancement","Training data"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["speech recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optimal automatic speech recognition system selection","noisy environments","ASR systems","ASR performance","computational resources","optimal single system","CHiME","speech enhancement","feature transformation methods"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7820854","abstract":"To improve the performance of noisy automatic speech recognition (ASR), it is effective to prepare multiple ASR systems that can address the large varieties of noise.

We use Stacked Denoising Sparse Autoencoder as a classifier for single-carrier modulation classification. This classifier can classify different modulated signals by cumulants automatically, and omit the decision of feature thresholds. A very different aspect from conventional neural network is its stacked structure, which simplifies an exponentially large number of hidden units by a multi-layer construction. Moreover, the better performance of backpropagation and network tune can be achieved while using Stacked Sparse Autoencoder. In addition, Denoising process improves the performance of noise suppression by training the network with a corrupted database. The performance of the multi-classes classification is given by simulations, which indicates that there is a significant performance advantage over the conventional methods.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7820860/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Dec. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2017","accessionNumber":"16602841","htmlLink":"/document/7820860/","conferenceDate":"13-16 Dec. 2016","displayDocTitle":"A novel modulation classification method in cognitive radios using higher-order cumulants and denoising stacked sparse autoencoder","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A novel modulation classification method in cognitive radios using higher-order cumulants and denoising stacked sparse autoencoder","confLoc":"Jeju, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"39.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071824S","chronDate":"13-16 Dec. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7803478","isNumber":"7820670","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7803478","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"7820670","articleId":"7820860","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Asia Pacific Signal and Information Processing Association","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":7820875,"authors":[{"name":"Bo Wu","affiliation":["National Laboratory of Radar Signal Processing, Xidian University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Bo","lastName":"Wu","id":"37085884180"},{"name":"Kehuang Li","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, USA"],"firstName":"Kehuang","lastName":"Li","id":"37085707683"},{"name":"Minglei Yang","affiliation":["National Laboratory of Radar Signal Processing, Xidian University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Minglei","lastName":"Yang","id":"37595836900"},{"name":"Chin-Hui Lee","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, USA"],"firstName":"Chin-Hui","lastName":"Lee","id":"37280405600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-9-8814-7682-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2401-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7820875","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":310},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Speech","Training","Spectrogram","Training data","Reverberation","Speech processing","Harmonic analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["minimax techniques","neural nets","regression analysis","reverberation","speech processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["target feature activation","DNN","speech dereverberation systems","linear activation function","anechoic speech","regression model","deep neural networks","min-max normalization scheme","anechoic spectrograms"]}],"abstract":"We adopt a linear activation function at the output layer and globally normalize the target features into zero mean and unit variance to learn the complicated mapping from reverberant to anechoic speech with a regression model based on deep neural networks (DNNs).

The kernel of the proposed algorithm is an iterative joint-bilateral filtering process. Experiments show that the upsampled image derived by our method is still refocusable and has better visual quality than those derived by other methods. Finally, the main contribution of this method is that it decomposes a 4D light field space L(u, v, s, t) upsampling problem into a series of 1D, parameter-free upsampling subproblems that can be solved fast in u-s and v-t EPI domains.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7820878/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Dec. 2016","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"13-16 Dec. 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7820878/","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2017","publicationDate":"Dec. 2016","accessionNumber":"16602953","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Light field upsampling by joint bilateral filtering on epipolar plane images","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Light field upsampling by joint bilateral filtering on epipolar plane images","confLoc":"Jeju, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"60.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046269S","chronDate":"13-16 Dec. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7803478","isNumber":"7820670","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7803478","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7820670","articleId":"7820878","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Asia Pacific Signal and Information Processing Association","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":7820907,"authors":[{"name":"Jian-Hong Pan","affiliation":["Speech and Audio Signal Processing Laboratory, Beijing University of Technology, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Jian-Hong","lastName":"Pan","id":"37086031353"},{"name":"Chang-Chun Bao","affiliation":["Speech and Audio Signal Processing Laboratory, Beijing University of Technology, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Chang-Chun","lastName":"Bao","id":"37068411000"},{"name":"Bing Bu","affiliation":["Speech and Audio Signal Processing Laboratory, Beijing University of Technology, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Bing","lastName":"Bu","id":"38241289000"},{"name":"Mao-shen Jia","affiliation":["Speech and Audio Signal Processing Laboratory, Beijing University of Technology, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Mao-shen","lastName":"Jia","id":"37409602600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-9-8814-7682-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2401-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7820907","dbTime":"15 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":100},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Harmonic analysis","Microphones","Image reconstruction","Acoustic measurements","Acoustics","Transfer functions","Receivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["acoustic signal processing","compressed sensing","reverberation chambers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["acoustic transfer function","compressed sensing techniques","reverberant room","acoustic signal processing","source position","receiver position","microphones","source domain"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we proposed a new efficient measurement method of the acoustic transfer function (ATF) between a fixed source and a predesigned region. Measuring the ATF in reverberant room is a cumbersome procedure in acoustic signal processing, because the ATF rapidly varies with varying source and receiver positions over the room. A major problem in the measurement is how to acquire the higher order ATF coefficients using a limited number of microphones. Based on the general model of ATF, we assume that the ATF is sparse in source domain, and then acquire the higher order ATF coefficients by applying compressed sensing techniques. Simulation results demonstrate that the method is a practical way of measuring the ATF over large area with dramatically reduced number of microphones. The successful estimation of the ATF over a wide frequency range has also been demonstrated.","doi":"10.1109/APSIPA.2016.7820907","publicationTitle":"2016 Asia-Pacific Signal and Information Processing Association Annual Summit and Conference (APSIPA)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 Asia-Pacific Signal and Information Processing Association Annual Summit and Conference (APSIPA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7803478/7820670/07820907.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APSIPA.2016.7820907","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7820670","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Measurement of the acoustic transfer function using compressed sensing techniques","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7820907","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Dec. 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7820907/","displayDocTitle":"Measurement of the acoustic transfer function using compressed sensing techniques","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2016","accessionNumber":"16602864","htmlLink":"/document/7820907/","conferenceDate":"13-16 Dec. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Measurement of the acoustic transfer function using compressed sensing techniques","confLoc":"Jeju, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"91.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.087957S","chronDate":"13-16 Dec. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7803478","isNumber":"7820670","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7803478","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7820670","articleId":"7820907","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Asia Pacific Signal and Information Processing Association","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7820990,"authors":[{"name":"Alexandra Psarrou","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Westminster, United Kingdom"],"firstName":"Alexandra","lastName":"Psarrou","id":"37322941900"},{"name":"Anastassia Angelopoulou","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Westminster, United Kingdom"],"firstName":"Anastassia","lastName":"Angelopoulou","id":"37322941400"},{"name":"Markos Mentzelopoulos","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Westminster, United Kingdom"],"firstName":"Markos","lastName":"Mentzelopoulos","id":"37085387316"},{"name":"Jos\u00e9 Garc\u00eda-Rodr\u00edguez","affiliation":["Department of Computer Technology, University of Alicante, Spain"],"firstName":"Jos\u00e9","lastName":"Garc\u00eda-Rodr\u00edguez","id":"38271627200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-8910-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-8911-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2154-512X"}],"articleNumber":"7820990","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":113},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Entropy","Shape","Topology","Computer vision","Solid modeling","Two dimensional displays","Probabilistic logic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["entropy","feature extraction","Hebbian learning","image registration","neural nets","performance evaluation","probability","shape recognition","statistical analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["performance evaluation","statistical model","neural network model","nonrigid shape-based registration","computer vision","image processing","medical imaging","optimal transformation","optimal mapping","nonrigid objects","rigid objects","probabilistic methods","growing neural gas network","GNG","feature-based registration algorithms","entropy shape modelling","curvature information","nearest-neighbour relationships","competitive Hebbian learning","shape deformation","shape 2D MRI brain ventricles"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Shape registration","entropy","self-organising networks","probabilistic models"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7820990","abstract":"Shape-based registration methods frequently encounters in the domains of computer vision, image processing and medical imaging.

Using entropy shape modelling is performed by connecting the point sets with the highest probability of curvature information, while with GNG the points sets are connected using nearest-neighbour relationships derived from competitive hebbian learning.

The core idea is to employ the valley points between the fingers to establish a coordinate system and then obtain the ROI of palmprints. However when extracting the keypoints, conventional methods have three problems: (i) they are so sensitive to parameters and background noise due to lack of joint optimization, (ii) accuracy of the location of keypoints is not good enough, (iii) extracting speed can be faster. To address the above problems, this paper presents a novel approach to extract palmprint ROI using convolutional neural net. First, we present a new CNN to identify the palmprint being a left or right hand. Then we propose a specific designed and optimized CNN to detect the keypoints. Finally we test our method using palmprint verification algorithm, competitive coding. Experimental results show that the proposed novel method is not only fast and efficient, but also robust for ROI extraction.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-15 Dec. 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7820994/","accessionNumber":"16602164","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7820994/","publicationDate":"Dec. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2017","conferenceDate":"12-15 Dec. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Extracting region of interest for palmprint by convolutional neural networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Extracting region of interest for palmprint by convolutional neural networks","confLoc":"Oulu, Finland","sourcePdf":"Paper36.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.081084S","chronDate":"12-15 Dec. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7799452","isNumber":"7820922","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7799452","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"7820922","articleId":"7820994","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":7821005,"authors":[{"name":"Chunlai Wang","affiliation":["Institute of Signal Processing and System Theory, University of Stuttgart, Germany"],"firstName":"Chunlai","lastName":"Wang","id":"37085774177"},{"name":"Lukas Mauch","affiliation":["Institute of Signal Processing and System Theory, University of Stuttgart, Germany"],"firstName":"Lukas","lastName":"Mauch","id":"38543019400"},{"name":"Ze Guo","affiliation":["Institute of Signal Processing and System Theory, University of Stuttgart, Germany"],"firstName":"Ze","lastName":"Guo","id":"37086138998"},{"name":"Bin Yang","affiliation":["Institute of Signal Processing and System Theory, University of Stuttgart, Germany"],"firstName":"Bin","lastName":"Yang","id":"37399884400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-8910-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-8911-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2154-512X"}],"articleNumber":"7821005","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":522},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7821005","abstract":"In this paper we examine the use of deep convolutional neural networks for semantic image segmentation, which separates an input image into multiple regions corresponding to predefined object classes.

Decomposing an image into a set of spatial-spectral components is an important characteristic of 3D-DWT.

In our prosed approach, the CNN is fine-tuned firstly on the face spoofing datasets. Then, the block principle component analysis (PCA) method is utilized to reduce the dimensionality of features that can avoid the over-fitting problem. Lastly, the support vector machine (SVM) is employed to distinguish the real the real and fake faces.

It occurs on the skin surface and develops from cells known as melanocytes. The same cells are also responsible for benign lesions commonly known as moles, which are visually similar to melanoma in its early stage. If melanoma is treated correctly, it is very often curable. Currently, much research is concentrated on the automated recognition of melanomas. In this paper, we propose an automated melanoma recognition system, which is based on deep learning method combined with so called hand-crafted RSurf features and Local Binary Patterns. The experimental evaluation on a large publicly available dataset demonstrates high classification accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of our proposed approach when it is compared with other classifiers on the same dataset.","doi":"10.1109/IPTA.2016.7821017","publicationTitle":"2016 Sixth International Conference on Image Processing Theory, Tools and Applications (IPTA)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 Sixth International Conference on Image Processing Theory, Tools and Applications (IPTA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7799452/7820922/07821017.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IPTA.2016.7821017","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7820922","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Combining deep learning and hand-crafted features for skin lesion classification","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7821017","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-15 Dec. 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7821017/","displayDocTitle":"Combining deep learning and hand-crafted features for skin lesion classification","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2016","accessionNumber":"16602178","htmlLink":"/document/7821017/","conferenceDate":"12-15 Dec. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Combining deep learning and hand-crafted features for skin lesion classification","confLoc":"Oulu, Finland","sourcePdf":"Paper65.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058798S","chronDate":"12-15 Dec. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7799452","isNumber":"7820922","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7799452","citationCount":"53","xplore-issue":"7820922","articleId":"7821017","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7821106,"authors":[{"name":"Herv\u00e9 Legay","affiliation":["Thales Alenia Space, Toulose, France"],"firstName":"Herv\u00e9","lastName":"Legay","id":"37267256600"},{"name":"S\u00e9gol\u00e8ne Tubau","affiliation":["Thales Alenia Space, Toulose, France"],"firstName":"S\u00e9gol\u00e8ne","lastName":"Tubau","id":"37085894962"},{"name":"Etienne Girard","affiliation":["Thales Alenia Space, Toulose, France"],"firstName":"Etienne","lastName":"Girard","id":"37309246300"},{"name":"Jean-Philippe Fraysse","affiliation":["Thales Alenia Space, Toulose, France"],"firstName":"Jean-Philippe","lastName":"Fraysse","id":"37085887458"},{"name":"Renaud Chiniard","affiliation":["Thales Alenia Space, Toulose, France"],"firstName":"Renaud","lastName":"Chiniard","id":"37304401000"},{"name":"Cheikh Diallo","affiliation":["IETR, UMR CNRS 6164, University of Rennes 1, Rennes, France"],"firstName":"Cheikh","lastName":"Diallo","id":"37085748129"},{"name":"Ronan Sauleau","affiliation":["IETR, UMR CNRS 6164, University of Rennes 1, Rennes, France"],"firstName":"Ronan","lastName":"Sauleau","id":"37278796800"},{"name":"Mauro Ettorre","affiliation":["IETR, UMR CNRS 6164, University of Rennes 1, Rennes, France"],"firstName":"Mauro","lastName":"Ettorre","id":"37400657800"},{"name":"Nelson Fonseca","affiliation":["Moltek Consultants Ltd for the European Space Agency, Noordwijk, The Netherlands"],"firstName":"Nelson","lastName":"Fonseca","id":"37305142400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-4-88552-313-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7960-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7821106","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":552},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Lenses","Antenna measurements","Antenna radiation patterns","Aperture antennas","Delay lines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna radiation patterns","array signal processing","lens antennas","multibeam antennas","parallel plate waveguides","S-parameters","waveguide antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiple beam antenna","parallel plate waveguide continuous delay lens beamformer","quasioptical beamformer","wide scanning capability","Ku band","return loss","mutual coupling","S-parameter","antenna radiation pattern"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Antennas","quasi-optical beamformers","multiple beam antenna"]}],"abstract":"A novel quasi-optical beamformer based on a continuous delay lens was designed, manufactured and tested.

The application is thought for mobile satellite communications and internet links, mainly for commercial airplanes. The impossibility to build full active antennas, including amplifiers in all the elements, leads to a modular semi active antenna. Here the module is a small subarray with complete phase control in the elements. The phase control is made with ad-hoc phase shifters giving the minimum losses. Only two-bit control has been selected to perform phase shifters associated to a circular polarization radiating element. The feeding network has been selected to minimise the losses and the gap waveguide has been designed to perform the network. The radiating element is a circular double patch fed into two points to obtain circular polarization. The entire prototype has been designed in LTCC substrate to minimise the losses and stabilise the structure.","publicationTitle":"2016 International Symposium on Antennas and Propagation (ISAP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 International Symposium on Antennas and Propagation (ISAP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7794367/7821043/07821111.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7821043","startPage":"128","endPage":"129","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Ka band active array antenna for mobile satellite communications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7821111","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Ka band active array antenna for mobile satellite communications","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 Oct. 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7821111/","conferenceDate":"24-28 Oct. 2016","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2016","accessionNumber":"16602149","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7821111/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Ka band active array antenna for mobile satellite communications","confLoc":"Okinawa, Japan","sourcePdf":"2A23.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056678S","chronDate":"24-28 Oct. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7794367","isNumber":"7821043","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7794367","xplore-issue":"7821043","articleId":"7821111","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEICE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7821118,"authors":[{"name":"Wen-Shan Chen","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Southern Taiwan University of Science and Technology, Tainan, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Wen-Shan","lastName":"Chen","id":"37279192200"},{"name":"Ching-Yu Huang","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Southern Taiwan University of Science and Technology, Tainan, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Ching-Yu","lastName":"Huang","id":"37085493640"},{"name":"Hung-Jui Hsu","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Southern Taiwan University of Science and Technology, Tainan, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Hung-Jui","lastName":"Hsu","id":"37086104725"},{"name":"Tzu-Chi Lu","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Southern Taiwan University of Science and Technology, Tainan, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Tzu-Chi","lastName":"Lu","id":"37086104488"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-4-88552-313-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7960-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7821118","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":257},"abstract":"A design of compact MIMO antenna achieving the band of LTE 700 for fourth generation (4G) technology is proposed and studied.

That is, using genetic algorithm can obtain better performance for emulating radio channel environment.","publicationTitle":"2016 International Symposium on Antennas and Propagation (ISAP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 International Symposium on Antennas and Propagation (ISAP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7794367/7821043/07821151.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7821043","startPage":"208","endPage":"209","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Three-dimension channel spatial characteristics emulation based on genetic algorithm in a MIMO OTA setup","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7821151","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Three-dimension channel spatial characteristics emulation based on genetic algorithm in a MIMO OTA setup","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 Oct. 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7821151/","conferenceDate":"24-28 Oct. 2016","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2016","accessionNumber":"16601749","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7821151/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Three-dimension channel spatial characteristics emulation based on genetic algorithm in a MIMO OTA setup","confLoc":"Okinawa, Japan","sourcePdf":"2D15.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.040321S","chronDate":"24-28 Oct. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7794367","isNumber":"7821043","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7794367","xplore-issue":"7821043","articleId":"7821151","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEICE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7821185,"authors":[{"name":"Hirofumi Suganuma","affiliation":["Graduated School of Fundamental Science and Engineering, Waseda University, Shinjuku-ku, Japan"],"firstName":"Hirofumi","lastName":"Suganuma","id":"37086078243"},{"name":"Tomoki Maruko","affiliation":["Graduated School of Fundamental Science and Engineering, Waseda University, Shinjuku-ku, Japan"],"firstName":"Tomoki","lastName":"Maruko","id":"37085692753"},{"name":"Fumiaki Maehara","affiliation":["Graduated School of Fundamental Science and Engineering, Waseda University, Shinjuku-ku, Japan"],"firstName":"Fumiaki","lastName":"Maehara","id":"37298056500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-4-88552-313-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7960-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7821185","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":101},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Correlation","OFDM","Interference suppression","Computer simulation","Mobile communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","correlation methods","error statistics","interference suppression","intersymbol interference","MIMO communication","OFDM modulation","time-of-arrival estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["nonperiodic transmission","correlation operation","BER","bit error rate","nonperiodic signals","even-numbered subcarriers","TDOA","time difference of arrival","network MIMO-OFDM systems","ISI suppression scheme","intersymbol interference"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Network MIMO-OFDM","inter-symbol interference","interference suppression","periodic signal","theoretical approach"]}],"abstract":"This paper proposes an inter-symbol interference (ISI) suppression scheme employing periodic signals for network MIMO-OFDM systems.

In this paper, we proposed an antenna design which can operate in the 2.6 GHz and 3.5 GHz bands and produce an orthogonal bi-directional radiation pattern. Antenna performances of reflection coefficient (S11), transmission coefficient (S21) and far-field radiation pattern are simulated and evaluated using the FDTD (finite-difference time-domain) method. As a result, dual-band operating to cover 2.6 GHz and 3.5GHz bands with desired Sn<;-10dB, and S21 between the two antenna elements for each frequency band is lower than -15 dB. Moreover, the MIMO performance can probably be improved because the difference between the two directional gain levels is achieved by approximately 15 dB when four slits are etched into the ground plane.","publicationTitle":"2016 International Symposium on Antennas and Propagation (ISAP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 International Symposium on Antennas and Propagation (ISAP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7794367/7821043/07821324.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7821043","startPage":"1048","endPage":"1049","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design of a dual-band MIMO antenna with orthogonal bi-directional radiation patterns","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7821324","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Design of a dual-band MIMO antenna with orthogonal bi-directional radiation patterns","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 Oct. 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7821324/","conferenceDate":"24-28 Oct. 2016","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2016","accessionNumber":"16601822","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7821324/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design of a dual-band MIMO antenna with orthogonal bi-directional radiation patterns","confLoc":"Okinawa, Japan","sourcePdf":"4D21.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.038251S","chronDate":"24-28 Oct. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7794367","isNumber":"7821043","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7794367","xplore-issue":"7821043","articleId":"7821324","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEICE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7821364,"authors":[{"name":"Yusuke Kobayashi","affiliation":["Graduate School of Science & Technology, Niigata University, Niigata, Japan"],"firstName":"Yusuke","lastName":"Kobayashi","id":"37086046834"},{"name":"Hiroyoshi Yamada","affiliation":["Graduate School of Science & Technology, Niigata University, Niigata, Japan"],"firstName":"Hiroyoshi","lastName":"Yamada","id":"37280270300"},{"name":"Yoshio Yamaguchi","affiliation":["Graduate School of Science & Technology, Niigata University, Niigata, Japan"],"firstName":"Yoshio","lastName":"Yamaguchi","id":"37268137200"},{"name":"Yuuichi Sugiyama","affiliation":["AS Engineering Group, Fujitsu TEN Limited, Kawasaki, Japan"],"firstName":"Yuuichi","lastName":"Sugiyama","id":"37086041454"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-4-88552-313-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7960-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7821364","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":342},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Synthetic aperture radar","Radar imaging","Millimeter wave radar","Compressed sensing","Image reconstruction","Automobiles"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compressed sensing","image reconstruction","image resolution","iterative methods","millimetre wave radar","radar imaging","road vehicle radar","synthetic aperture radar"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["scatterer","SAR image reconstruction","orthogonal iterative hard thresholding algorithm","high-resolution 2-dimensional image","MW automotive radar","synthetic aperture radar","automatic operating system","compressed sensing","millimeter wave automotive radar","squint mode SAR","data volume reduction"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Compressed sensing","Millimeter wave automotive radar","Synthetic aperture radar"]}],"abstract":"Automatic operating system for vehicles has been widely studied.

In this paper, we obtain the channel state information in an actual indoor environment.

Simulation results confirm the improvement of isolation between the antennas by 4 dB at the radiation frequency of 2.4 GHz without destroying the antenna operation performance when CSR-EBG is utilized.","publicationTitle":"2016 International Symposium on Antennas and Propagation (ISAP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 International Symposium on Antennas and Propagation (ISAP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7794367/7821043/07821519.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7821043","startPage":"826","endPage":"827","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A compact four-element MIMO antenna with high isolation based on EBG","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7821519","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A compact four-element MIMO antenna with high isolation based on EBG","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 Oct. 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7821519/","conferenceDate":"24-28 Oct. 2016","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2016","accessionNumber":"16601912","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7821519/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A compact four-element MIMO antenna with high isolation based on EBG","confLoc":"Okinawa, Japan","sourcePdf":"POS258.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050781S","chronDate":"24-28 Oct. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7794367","isNumber":"7821043","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7794367","xplore-issue":"7821043","articleId":"7821519","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEICE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7821547,"authors":[{"name":"Sang-Gyu Ha","affiliation":["Dept. of Electronic Computer and Engineering, Hanyang University, Seoul, Korea"],"firstName":"Sang-Gyu","lastName":"Ha","id":"38548276800"},{"name":"Jeahoon Cho","affiliation":["Dept. of Electronic Computer and Engineering, Hanyang University, Seoul, Korea"],"firstName":"Jeahoon","lastName":"Cho","id":"37068297000"},{"name":"Minseok Park","affiliation":["Dept. of Electronic Computer and Engineering, Hanyang University, Seoul, Korea"],"firstName":"Minseok","lastName":"Park","id":"37086088109"},{"name":"Jaewoo Baek","affiliation":["Dept. of Electronic Computer and Engineering, Hanyang University, Seoul, Korea"],"firstName":"Jaewoo","lastName":"Baek","id":"37086091470"},{"name":"Kyung-Young Jung","affiliation":["Dept. of Electronic Computer and Engineering, Hanyang University, Seoul, Korea"],"firstName":"Kyung-Young","lastName":"Jung","id":"37286659200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-4-88552-313-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7960-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7821547","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":82},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Finite difference methods","Time-domain analysis","Perpendicular magnetic anisotropy","Photonic crystals","Magnetic analysis","Magnetic domains"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dielectric materials","ferromagnetic materials","finite difference time-domain analysis","photonic crystals"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["magnetic photonic crystals","complex envelope ADI-FDTD method","alternating-direction-implicit finite-difference time-domain method","MPhC","anisotropic dielectric layers","ferromagnetic layer","Courant number values"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Complex-envelop-alternating-direction-implicit finite-difference time-domain (CE-ADI-FDTD)","anisotropic dielectrics","magnetic photonic crystals (MPhCs)"]}],"abstract":"We develop the complex envelop alternating-direction-implicit finite-difference time-domain (CE-ADI-FDTD) suitable for analysis of magnetic photonic crystals (MPhCs) which require highly refined grids.

Initially, the two layers of SIW resonator are constructed, and then the microfluidic channel is etched on Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) material stuck between the two SIW layers for non-contact chemical sensing applications. S-parameters of the proposed SIW resonator are simulated and measured. The dominant mode frequency of the proposed structure is successfully switched from 18.46 GHz to 14.83 GHz when ethanol is injected and the frequency becomes 14.11 GHz when DI-water is injected into the microfluidic channel.

Telecom traffic prediction at a particular instant depends on thorough knowledge of day of the week, hour of the day and instant of the hour. Distributed cooperative spectrum sensing is infrastructure based in which the sensor nodes themselves takes several iteration to arrive at decision about vacant channels where CR nodes have no previous knowledge about each channel behaviour. The proposed network is also architecture based but channel availability decision is taken by a separate control unit called Cognitive Radio-Base Station Controller (CR-BSC). In this architecture, SU functions as probe for occupied primary and secondary channels available in the environment and transmit to Cognitive Radio-Base Station (CR-BS) for periodic updation of channel status database. Frequency of probing and transmission to CR-BS consumes good quantum of energy of SU and needs to be scheduled properly for optimum SU battery life. On placement of SU call, minutewise prediction is done for next few minutes for available set of channels and its blocking probability when both secondary user traffic together with primary user traffic are present in the system. The results obtained have been validated through live mobile data of primary user network.","doi":"10.1109/FTC.2016.7821615","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 Future Technologies Conference (FTC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7802033/7821581/07821615.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7821581","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FTC.2016.7821615","publicationTitle":"2016 Future Technologies Conference (FTC)","startPage":"231","endPage":"236","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Network architecture model of infrastructure based mobile cognitive radio system in licensed band with blocking probability assessment","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7821615","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-7 Dec. 2016","displayDocTitle":"Network architecture model of infrastructure based mobile cognitive radio system in licensed band with blocking probability assessment","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7821615/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7821615/","publicationDate":"Dec. 2016","accessionNumber":"16602691","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2017","conferenceDate":"6-7 Dec. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Network architecture model of infrastructure based mobile cognitive radio system in licensed band with blocking probability assessment","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"30Paper413.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.098197S","chronDate":"6-7 Dec. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7802033","isNumber":"7821581","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7802033","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7821581","articleId":"7821615","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7821658,"authors":[{"name":"Muhammad Bashir Abdullahi","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Federal University of Technology, Nigeria"],"firstName":"Muhammad Bashir","lastName":"Abdullahi","id":"37992378700"},{"name":"Fati Idris","affiliation":["Department of Mathematics, Federal University of Technology, Nigeria"],"firstName":"Fati","lastName":"Idris","id":"37086039242"},{"name":"Adamu Alhaji Mohammed","affiliation":["Department of Mathematics, Federal University of Technology, Nigeria"],"firstName":"Adamu Alhaji","lastName":"Mohammed","id":"37086045061"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4171-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4172-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7821658","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":219},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7821658","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image enhancement","Algorithm design and analysis","Frequency-domain analysis","Gabor filters","Particle swarm optimization","Genetic algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["evolutionary computation","fingerprint identification","image enhancement","particle swarm optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["particle swarm optimization algorithm-based parameter tuning","fingerprint image enhancement","evolutionary algorithms","inertia weight","acceleration constants","PSO-based parameterized transformation function","enhanced image contrast effect","pixel intensity values","image quality","objective function","FVC-2004 database"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["particle swarm optimization","fingerprint image enhancement","parameter tuning","transformation function"]}],"doi":"10.1109/FTC.2016.7821658","pdfPath":"/iel7/7802033/7821581/07821658.pdf","publicationTitle":"2016 Future Technologies Conference (FTC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 Future Technologies Conference (FTC)","startPage":"528","endPage":"536","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7821581","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FTC.2016.7821658","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance analysis of particle swarm optimization algorithm-based parameter tuning for fingerprint image enhancement","abstract":"Existing algorithms designed for Fingerprint Image Enhancement either lack the ability to enhance poor quality image or are computationally expensive. Evolutionary algorithms are often used to enhance images. Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is one of the most progressive algorithms but has parameters, which are not properly tuned to reduce the number of iterations. In this paper, PSO parameters; inertia weight (w) and acceleration constants (c\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1</sub>\n and c\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sub>\n) were fine-tuned. PSO-based parameterized transformation function, which incorporates both the global and local information of an image was developed to maximize the information content of the fingerprint image. In the transformation function, a threshold of 0.99 was set to control the contrast effect of the enhanced image. The intensity values of pixels that are less than the threshold were transformed. The image quality was evaluated using an Objective Function in term of Number of Edges, Sum of Edge intensities and the exponential of the entropy. The commonly-well-known database FVC-2004 is used in this study. It was observed from the experiments that the best PSO parameters set used for successful convergence of the PSO Algorithm were w \u03f5 [0.7, 0.75] and (c\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1</sub>\n, c\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sub>\n) \u03f5 [1.2,1.3].

Although the standard CODECs have been designed to include algorithms with optimal efficiency, large number of coding parameters that can be used to fine tune their operation, within known constraints of for e.g., available computational power, bandwidth, energy consumption, etc. With large number of such parameters involved, determining which parameters will play a significant role in providing optimal quality of service within given constraints is a further challenge that needs to be met. We propose a framework that uses machine learning algorithms to model the performance of a video CODEC based on the significant coding parameters. We define objective functions that can be used to model the video quality, CPU time utilisation and bit-rate. We show that these objective functions can be practically utilised in video Encoder designs, in particular in their performance optimisation within given constraints. A Multi-objective Optimisation framework based on Genetic Algorithms is thus proposed to optimise the performance of a video codec. The framework is designed to jointly minimize the complexity, Bit-rate and to maximize the quality of the compressed video stream.","doi":"10.1109/FTC.2016.7821661","pdfPath":"/iel7/7802033/7821581/07821661.pdf","startPage":"553","endPage":"559","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 Future Technologies Conference (FTC)","publicationTitle":"2016 Future Technologies Conference (FTC)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FTC.2016.7821661","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7821581","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A machine learning based framework for parameter based multi-objective optimisation of a H.265 video CODEC","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7821661/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-7 Dec. 2016","displayDocTitle":"A machine learning based framework for parameter based multi-objective optimisation of a H.265 video CODEC","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2017","accessionNumber":"16602578","publicationDate":"Dec. 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7821661/","conferenceDate":"6-7 Dec. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A machine learning based framework for parameter based multi-objective optimisation of a H.265 video CODEC","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"76Paper454.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053017S","chronDate":"6-7 Dec. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7802033","isNumber":"7821581","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7802033","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7821581","articleId":"7821661","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-10"},{"_id":7821689,"authors":[{"name":"Tammy R.

IoT intends to deliver the next wave of disruption and growth to every facet of digital life, and now is the time for laying the groundwork, upon which IoT processes can be built. In this paper, we present the culmination of over 15 years of Artificial Intelligence research, software development and deployment of commercial applications built using adaptive software agents in an intelligent system framework with automatic anomaly detection and notification. We have created a system of components that have allowed us to create complex applications quickly through the use and re-use of adaptive agents in an intelligent system for automation, communication, and control. To be secure and adaptive, agents were also created whose primary purpose is to monitor normal behavior and react when something out of the ordinary occurs. Reactions can include halting processes, starting up other processes, notifying humans, interacting with 3rd party systems, etc. Each agent includes its own security layer as part of the agent triggering mechanism, as well as the ability to communicate thru all digital channels including Push Notification. Push Notification allows for server-based communication to any number of IoT devices and does not rely upon SIM-based (phone, text messaging) nor IP-based (networking) communication channels.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"IoT applications in an adaptive intelligent system with responsive anomaly detection","publicationTitle":"2016 Future Technologies Conference (FTC)","doi":"10.1109/FTC.2016.7821689","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 Future Technologies Conference (FTC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7802033/7821581/07821689.pdf","startPage":"754","endPage":"762","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FTC.2016.7821689","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7821581","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7821689","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7821689/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-7 Dec. 2016","displayDocTitle":"IoT applications in an adaptive intelligent system with responsive anomaly detection","conferenceDate":"6-7 Dec. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7821689/","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2017","publicationDate":"Dec. 2016","accessionNumber":"16602641","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"IoT applications in an adaptive intelligent system with responsive anomaly detection","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"104Paper196.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.079761S","chronDate":"6-7 Dec. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7802033","isNumber":"7821581","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7802033","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7821581","articleId":"7821689","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7821693,"authors":[{"name":"Ali Raza","affiliation":["EPIC LAB, Islamabad, Pakistan"],"firstName":"Ali","lastName":"Raza","id":"37086124102"},{"name":"Ataul Aziz Ikram","affiliation":["ORIC, EPIC LAB, Islamabad, Pakistan"],"firstName":"Ataul Aziz","lastName":"Ikram","id":"37604210300"},{"name":"Asfand Amin","affiliation":["EPIC LAB, Islamabad, Pakistan"],"firstName":"Asfand","lastName":"Amin","id":"37086118166"},{"name":"Ahmad Jamal Ikram","affiliation":["EPIC LAB, Islamabad, Pakistan"],"firstName":"Ahmad Jamal","lastName":"Ikram","id":"37086119398"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4171-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4172-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7821693","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":18,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":871},"keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Internet of Things","microcomputers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["low cost development boards","power efficient development boards","IoT applications","credit card","hardware manufacturers","cost effectiveness","power efficiency","easy deployment","technical specifications","smart boards","Internet of Things","Raspberry Pi"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["IoT","Smart Boards","Raspberry Pi","BeagleBoneBlack","UDOO x86","Arduino","Edison","Galileo","Tessel 2"]}],"abstract":"As the term IoT is expanding there is a huge increase in the number of development boards being introduced in the market ranging in size from a quarter to a credit card.

The circuit processing spatiotemporal inputs we demonstrate here highlights the mechanisms and role of structural plasticity. In many neuromorphic systems, synaptic plasticity is used for learning, memory and information processing. In these systems, neurons are fully or sparsely connected and synaptic connections between neurons become stronger or weaker during the learning process. However, in living organisms, structural plasticity plays a role in learning as well. To demonstrate the utility of structural plasticity, our example circuit autonomously learns spatiotemporal patterns with structural plasticity rather than synaptic plasticity, learning by long-term changes in neural pathways rather than by updating synaptic weights. Our neuromorphic system has a completely non Von-Neumann architecture; it does not have separate units for memory and processing. Instead, its memory and processing capability emerge from the way its neurons are connected. Finally, inputs do not have preconceived meaning and therefore the circuit learns to recognize repeated input patterns in an unsupervised mode. Incorporating both structural plasticity and synaptic plasticity into individual neurons is the ultimate goal of the BioRC project.","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 Future Technologies Conference (FTC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7802033/7821581/07821696.pdf","startPage":"806","endPage":"815","publicationTitle":"2016 Future Technologies Conference (FTC)","doi":"10.1109/FTC.2016.7821696","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FTC.2016.7821696","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7821581","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7821696","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A bio-inspired electronic mechanism for unsupervised learning using structural plasticity","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neurons","Pattern recognition","Transistors","Spatiotemporal phenomena","Integrated circuit modeling","Nanobioscience"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["brain","neural nets","neurophysiology","unsupervised learning"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bio-inspired electronic mechanism","unsupervised learning","structural plasticity","human brain","neuromorphic systems","synaptic plasticity","memory processing","information processing","synaptic connections","spatiotemporal pattern learning","neural pathways","nonVon-Neumann architecture","BioRC project"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Bio-inspired electronic","Spatiotemporal patterns","Structural plasticity","Unsupervised learning"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7821696/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-7 Dec. 2016","displayDocTitle":"A bio-inspired electronic mechanism for unsupervised learning using structural plasticity","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7821696/","publicationDate":"Dec. 2016","accessionNumber":"16602587","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2017","conferenceDate":"6-7 Dec. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A bio-inspired electronic mechanism for unsupervised learning using structural plasticity","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"111Paper32.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.109865S","chronDate":"6-7 Dec. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7802033","isNumber":"7821581","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7802033","xplore-issue":"7821581","articleId":"7821696","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7821697,"authors":[{"name":"Saman Sarraf","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, McMaster University, Hamilton, ON, Canada","Rotman Research Institue at Baycrest University of Toronto"],"firstName":"Saman","lastName":"Sarraf","id":"37085421465"},{"name":"Ghassem Tofighi","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, Ryerson University, Toronto, ON, Canada"],"firstName":"Ghassem","lastName":"Tofighi","id":"38556072600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4171-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4172-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7821697","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":32,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":3258},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7821697","abstract":"Over the past decade, machine learning techniques and in particular predictive modeling and pattern recognition in biomedical sciences, from drug delivery systems to medical imaging, have become one of the most important methods of assisting researchers in gaining a deeper understanding of issues in their entirety and solving complex medical problems. Deep learning is a powerful machine learning algorithm in classification that extracts low-to high-level features. In this paper, we employ a convolutional neural network to distinguish an Alzheimers brain from a normal, healthy brain. The importance of classifying this type of medical data lies in its potential to develop a predictive model or system in order to recognize the symptoms of Alzheimers disease when compared with normal subjects and to estimate the stages of the disease. Classification of clinical data for medical conditions such as Alzheimers disease has always been challenging, and the most problematic aspect has always been selecting the strongest discriminative features. Using the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and the famous architecture LeNet-5, we successfully classified functional MRI data of Alzheimers subjects from normal controls, where the accuracy of testing data reached 96.85%. This experiment suggests that the shift and scale invariant features extracted by CNN followed by deep learning classification represents the most powerful method of distinguishing clinical data from healthy data in fMRI. This approach also allows for expansion of the methodology to predict more complicated systems.","doi":"10.1109/FTC.2016.7821697","startPage":"816","endPage":"820","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 Future Technologies Conference (FTC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7802033/7821581/07821697.pdf","publicationTitle":"2016 Future Technologies Conference (FTC)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FTC.2016.7821697","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7821581","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Deep learning-based pipeline to recognize Alzheimer's disease using fMRI data","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Alzheimer's disease","Machine learning","Feature extraction","Biological neural networks","Neurons","Biomedical imaging"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biomedical MRI","convolution","diseases","feature extraction","learning (artificial intelligence)","medical computing","neural nets","pattern classification"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["scale invariant features extraction","functional MRI data classification","LeNet-5 architecture","CNN","clinical data classification","Alzheimers brain","convolutional neural network","medical imaging","drug delivery systems","biomedical sciences","pattern recognition","predictive modeling","machine learning","Alzheimer disease","deep learning-based pipeline"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Deep learning","Alzheimer's Disease","fMRI"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7821697/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-7 Dec. 2016","displayDocTitle":"Deep learning-based pipeline to recognize Alzheimer's disease using fMRI data","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7821697/","publicationDate":"Dec. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2017","conferenceDate":"6-7 Dec. 2016","accessionNumber":"16602728","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Deep learning-based pipeline to recognize Alzheimer's disease using fMRI data","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"112Paper119.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052278S","chronDate":"6-7 Dec. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7802033","isNumber":"7821581","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7802033","citationCount":"32","xplore-issue":"7821581","articleId":"7821697","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":7821698,"authors":[{"name":"Muhammad Amir Shafiq","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA"],"firstName":"Muhammad Amir","lastName":"Shafiq","id":"37085665407"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4171-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4172-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7821698","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":379},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7821698","abstract":"Kernel methods and neural networks (NN) are two of the most powerful tools of machine learning to solve the engineering and science problems.

The dataset is used for training, validation, and testing of concrete's CS using KRR and NN. We use both linear and nonlinear kernels in ridge regression, and up to four layers NN with three hidden layers and one output layer for CS prediction. KRR and NN are designed in MATLAB, and we use different NN types and training functions with objective evaluation criterion to obtain the optimum models for CS prediction. We choose gradient descent with momentum weight bias learning and mean square error (MSE) performance functions for model training. Simulation results show that both KRR and NN predict the CS of concrete accurately and efficiently with admissible MSE and correlation coefficient close to one.

In this paper, we propose a direct adaptive inverse control (DAIC) for nonlinear plants based on multilayered feed forward neural network (MFNN) using back propagation through model (BPTM) algorithm. Neural Network (NN) controller is designed directly in the feed forward loop using the estimated model of nonlinear plant, which is obtained using forward modeling. NN adaptive control is designed such the NN controller responds online to the changes in system dynamics.

Subsequently, piezoelectric stack actuators have been utilized often in microgripping applications due to its large force and precise micro displacement. This paper presents the experimental testing and results of Amplified Piezoelectric Actuators (APA) APA 50SX, APA 60S and APA 120S which can be used for actuation of a 2-DOF compliant microgripper. In this work a static force measurement experimental arrangement has been setup to measure and get the graphical relationship of Force-Displacement-Voltage which can be used determine the input force to the microgripper at various displacement and voltage levels. The above three APA's are tested and APA 120S is found to be the most suitable option whose data is then validated on the microgripper experimental arrangement. An average deviation of 9.74% is observed from the real-time measured values and 10.33% deviation from the FEM results. The obtained values are in good correlation and the experimental test procedure provides the complete static data for the above actuators.","doi":"10.1109/FTC.2016.7821765","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FTC.2016.7821765","startPage":"1282","endPage":"1289","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 Future Technologies Conference (FTC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7802033/7821581/07821765.pdf","publicationTitle":"2016 Future Technologies Conference (FTC)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7821581","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Experimental investigation of amplified piezoelectric stack actuators 50XS, 60S and 120S for the actuation of microgrippers","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"6-7 Dec. 2016","displayDocTitle":"Experimental investigation of amplified piezoelectric stack actuators 50XS, 60S and 120S for the actuation of microgrippers","conferenceDate":"6-7 Dec. 2016","publicationDate":"Dec. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2017","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7821765/","accessionNumber":"16602577","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7821765/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Experimental investigation of amplified piezoelectric stack actuators 50XS, 60S and 120S for the actuation of microgrippers","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"180Paper477.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057784S","chronDate":"6-7 Dec. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7802033","isNumber":"7821581","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7802033","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7821581","articleId":"7821765","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":7821774,"authors":[{"name":"Milan Oulehla","affiliation":["Faculty of Applied Informatics, Tomas Bata University in Zlin, Zlin, Czech Republic"],"firstName":"Milan","lastName":"Oulehla","id":"37085704157"},{"name":"Zuzana Kom\u00ednkov\u00e1 Oplatkov\u00e1","affiliation":["Faculty of Applied Informatics, Tomas Bata University in Zlin, Zlin, Czech Republic"],"firstName":"Zuzana Kom\u00ednkov\u00e1","lastName":"Oplatkov\u00e1","id":"37297556900"},{"name":"David Malanik","affiliation":["Faculty of Applied Informatics, Tomas Bata University in Zlin, Zlin, Czech Republic"],"firstName":"David","lastName":"Malanik","id":"37085347627"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4171-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4172-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7821774","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":322},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7821774","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Mobile communication","Neural networks","Mobile computing","Computer architecture","Malware","Training","Algorithm design and analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["invasive software","learning (artificial intelligence)","mobile computing","neural nets","parallel architectures","peer-to-peer computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mobile malware","behavior pattern","command and control servers","peer-to-peer networks","neural network training set","parallel architecture","mobile botnet detection"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Android","bot","information gain","mobile botnet","mobile malware","neural networks","Ranker algorithm"]}],"doi":"10.1109/FTC.2016.7821774","pdfPath":"/iel7/7802033/7821581/07821774.pdf","publicationTitle":"2016 Future Technologies Conference (FTC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 Future Technologies Conference (FTC)","startPage":"1324","endPage":"1326","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7821581","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FTC.2016.7821774","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Detection of mobile botnets using neural networks","abstract":"This poster deals with botnets, the most dangerous kind of mobile malware, and their detection using neural networks.

However, they have certain common features which have been revealed by analysis of contemporary mobile botnets. These features have been used for creation of a neural network training set. Finally, the design of parallel architecture using neural network for useful detection of mobile botnets has been described.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-7 Dec. 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7821774/","accessionNumber":"16602634","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7821774/","publicationDate":"Dec. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2017","conferenceDate":"6-7 Dec. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Detection of mobile botnets using neural networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Detection of mobile botnets using neural networks","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"189Paper192.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049787S","chronDate":"6-7 Dec. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7802033","isNumber":"7821581","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7802033","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"7821581","articleId":"7821774","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":7821811,"authors":[{"name":"Mat\u011bj Bart\u00edk","affiliation":["Faculty of Information Technology, Czech Technical University in Prague"],"firstName":"Mat\u011bj","lastName":"Bart\u00edk","id":"37085591285"},{"name":"Ji\u0159\u00ed Bu\u010dek","affiliation":["Faculty of Information Technology, Czech Technical University in Prague"],"firstName":"Ji\u0159\u00ed","lastName":"Bu\u010dek","id":"38548222200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4473-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4474-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7821811","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":200},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Field programmable gate arrays","Power measurement","Current measurement","Semiconductor device measurement","Ciphers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cryptography","field programmable gate arrays","printed circuit design"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multipurpose experimental FPGA board","cryptography applications","PCB","printed circuit board","field programmable gate array","integrated circuit security","side-channel attacks","physically unclonable function"]}],"abstract":"This paper describes the evaluation of available experimental boards, the comparison of their supported set of experiments and other aspects.

For our simulations, the specific impulse responses of a (2 \u00d7 2) MIMO channel, including a 1.4 km multi-mode fiber and optical couplers at both ends, are measured for the operating wavelength of 1576 nm.","doi":"10.1109/RTUWO.2016.7821849","publicationTitle":"2016 Advances in Wireless and Optical Communications (RTUWO)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 Advances in Wireless and Optical Communications (RTUWO)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7811901/7821833/07821849.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RTUWO.2016.7821849","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7821833","startPage":"22","endPage":"27","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Polynomial matrix algorithms for broadband optical MIMO systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7821849","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Polynomial matrix algorithms for broadband optical MIMO systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-4 Nov. 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7821849/","conferenceDate":"3-4 Nov. 2016","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2016","accessionNumber":"16616646","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7821849/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Polynomial matrix algorithms for broadband optical MIMO systems","confLoc":"Riga, Latvia","sourcePdf":"p022-ahrens.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056212S","chronDate":"3-4 Nov. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7811901","isNumber":"7821833","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7811901","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7821833","articleId":"7821849","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7821851,"authors":[{"name":"Rida Khan","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Communications Engineering, Istanbul Technical University, Istanbul, Turkey"],"firstName":"Rida","lastName":"Khan","id":"37085561541"},{"name":"Ibrahim Altunbas","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Communications Engineering, Istanbul Technical University, Istanbul, Turkey"],"firstName":"Ibrahim","lastName":"Altunbas","id":"37443120300"},{"name":"Gunes Karabulut Kurt","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Communications Engineering, Istanbul Technical University, Istanbul, Turkey"],"firstName":"Gunes Karabulut","lastName":"Kurt","id":"38191208100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1535-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1536-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7821851","dbTime":"16 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":73},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Relays","Network coding","Silicon","Decoding","Multiuser detection","Wireless communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["amplify and forward communication","channel coding","cooperative communication","decode and forward communication","diversity reception","error correction codes","OFDM modulation","radio networks","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel coded complex field network coding","OFDM","wireless networks","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","frequency selective fading","wide-band wireless channels","cooperative communication systems","CFNC scheme","relay based multiuser cooperative networks","cooperative wireless networks","frequency selective fading scenario","relaying strategies","amplify and forward","decode and forward","relay selection technique","channel coded CFNC","error performance","frequency selective faded cooperative communications environment"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["CFNC","OFDM","wireless relay networks","AAF","DAF","RS","channel encoding"]}],"abstract":"Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) is the most promising approach to combat the frequency selective fading nature of wide-band wireless channels. On the other hand, complex field network coding (CFNC) scheme offers the advantages of better spectral efficiency and full diversity when utilized in multiuser cooperative communication systems. The efficiency of CFNC scheme in relay based multiuser cooperative networks can be further enhanced with the incorporation of error control codes. These considerations motivate the utilization of OFDM and CFNC in cooperative wireless networks combined with error control codes for a frequency selective fading scenario. In this paper, we make a detailed analysis of such a setup while using different relaying strategies such as amplify and forward (AAF) and decode and forward (DAF) to evaluate the system performance. We also consider relay selection technique with both AAF and DAF schemes. Simulation results show that the channel coded CFNC with OFDM significantly improves the error performance in frequency selective faded cooperative communications environment.","doi":"10.1109/RTUWO.2016.7821851","publicationTitle":"2016 Advances in Wireless and Optical Communications (RTUWO)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 Advances in Wireless and Optical Communications (RTUWO)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7811901/7821833/07821851.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RTUWO.2016.7821851","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7821833","startPage":"32","endPage":"37","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Channel coded complex field network coding with OFDM in wireless networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7821851","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Channel coded complex field network coding with OFDM in wireless networks","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-4 Nov. 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7821851/","conferenceDate":"3-4 Nov. 2016","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2016","accessionNumber":"16604414","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7821851/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Channel coded complex field network coding with OFDM in wireless networks","confLoc":"Riga, Latvia","sourcePdf":"p032-khan.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.08068S","chronDate":"3-4 Nov. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7811901","isNumber":"7821833","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7811901","xplore-issue":"7821833","articleId":"7821851","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7821866,"authors":[{"name":"Amir Eslami","affiliation":["Electrical and Electronics Engineering Department, Istanbul Aydin University, Istanbul, Turkey"],"firstName":"Amir","lastName":"Eslami","id":"37085795151"},{"name":"Saeid Karamzadeh","affiliation":["Electrical and Electronics Engineering Department, Istanbul Aydin University, Istanbul, Turkey"],"firstName":"Saeid","lastName":"Karamzadeh","id":"37085717314"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1535-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1536-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7821866","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":220},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sensors","Hospitals","Level measurement","Terrain mapping","Wireless sensor networks","Cognitive radio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","hospitals","radio spectrum management","signal detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wireless technology","dense wire ropes","bandwidth scarcity","cognitive radio driven hospitals","primary devices","secondary devices","allocated spectrum","energy detection based spectrum sensing","memory based energy detection method","memory sticks"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["wireless technology hospitals","cognitive radio driven hospitals","spectrum sensing","energy detection","double threshold energy detection","memory"]}],"abstract":"Wireless technology can eliminate dense wire ropes from hospitals and far access to medical devices. The bandwidth scarcity is the biggest issue in this technology. In order to overcome this issue, cognitive radio driven hospitals are introduced and devices are divided in two categories. Primary devices are the ones with very high priority and their communication is vital for the patients and hospital, so that no interference should be made with such devices. Secondary devices are the ones which has lower priority and they can wait until the primary devices finish their communication and then, they begin to use the allocated spectrum. One of the key functions to assure that there will be no interference is a reliable spectrum sensing method. This method should be a simple one to be able to implement it in the secondary devices. Among all the sensing methods, energy detection based spectrum sensing is the most popular and easy to implement one. Memory based energy detection method is a new algorithm that we introduce in this paper by using memory sticks to improve the energy detection sensing method without making the sensing procedure more complex by only the cost of delay in secondary devices communication.","doi":"10.1109/RTUWO.2016.7821866","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 Advances in Wireless and Optical Communications (RTUWO)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7811901/7821833/07821866.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7821833","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RTUWO.2016.7821866","publicationTitle":"2016 Advances in Wireless and Optical Communications (RTUWO)","startPage":"111","endPage":"115","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Memory based energy detection spectrum sensing method in cognitive radio driven hospitals","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7821866","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-4 Nov. 2016","displayDocTitle":"Memory based energy detection spectrum sensing method in cognitive radio driven hospitals","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7821866/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7821866/","publicationDate":"Nov. 2016","accessionNumber":"16604413","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2017","conferenceDate":"3-4 Nov. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Memory based energy detection spectrum sensing method in cognitive radio driven hospitals","confLoc":"Riga, Latvia","sourcePdf":"p111-eslami.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068993S","chronDate":"3-4 Nov. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7811901","isNumber":"7821833","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7811901","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7821833","articleId":"7821866","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":7821878,"authors":[{"name":"Seda \u00dcst\u00fcnba\u015f","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, Istanbul Technical University, Istanbul, Turkey"],"firstName":"Seda","lastName":"\u00dcst\u00fcnba\u015f","id":"37085779401"},{"name":"\u00dcmit Ayg\u00f6l\u00fc","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, Istanbul Technical University, Istanbul, Turkey"],"firstName":"\u00dcmit","lastName":"Ayg\u00f6l\u00fc","id":"37267743300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1535-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1536-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7821878","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":126},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Relays","Receivers","Phase shift keying","Protocols","Optical transmitters","Radio transmitters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","error statistics","network coding","phase shift keying","radio receivers","radio transmitters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio cross network","primary transmitter","primary receiver","secondary transmitter","secondary receiver","secondary relay","overlay paradigm","unlicensed secondary system","licensed primary system","time slot","physical-layer network coding","bit-wise XOR operation","primary information bits","secondary information bits","bit error probability","BEP","M-PSK modulation","BER analysis"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7821878","doi":"10.1109/RTUWO.2016.7821878","publicationTitle":"2016 Advances in Wireless and Optical Communications (RTUWO)","abstract":"In this paper, a cognitive radio network which consists of a primary system with a pair of primary transmitter (PT) and a primary receiver (PR), and a secondary system with a secondary transmitter (ST), a secondary receiver (SR) and a secondary relay (R) is considered. It is assumed that the distances between the transmitter and receiver of both systems are so large that the aid of a relay is needed for a reliable communication. Moreover, the receiver of each system is assumed closer to the transmitter of the other system compared to its own transmitter. The considered protocol is based on the overlay paradigm where the unlicensed secondary system shares its relay with the licensed primary system and in return it accesses the licensed spectrum for its own transmission. In the first time slot, PT and ST transmit their signals to the relay while each receiver eavesdrops the signal of the other transmitter next to it. In the second time slot, the relay applies physical-layer network coding to the signal pair it decided in the previous time slot, through bit-wise XOR operation between primary and secondary information bits, modulates to the corresponding signal and broadcasts. Both receivers have the information bits of the other user from the signals received in the first time slot, hence they can extract their desired information bits by reapplying the bit-wise XOR operation to the bits received in the first and second time slots. The bit error probability (BEP) of the considered protocol for M-PSK modulation is analytically derived and supported via computer simulation results. The results show that the bit error performance of the primary system is significantly improved compared to the direct transmission case.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RTUWO.2016.7821878","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7821833","startPage":"173","endPage":"176","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 Advances in Wireless and Optical Communications (RTUWO)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7811901/7821833/07821878.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"BER analysis of physical-layer coding in cognitive radio cross network","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7821878/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-4 Nov. 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7821878/","displayDocTitle":"BER analysis of physical-layer coding in cognitive radio cross network","conferenceDate":"3-4 Nov. 2016","publicationDate":"Nov. 2016","accessionNumber":"16616645","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"BER analysis of physical-layer coding in cognitive radio cross network","confLoc":"Riga, Latvia","sourcePdf":"p173-ustunbas.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053861S","chronDate":"3-4 Nov. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7811901","isNumber":"7821833","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7811901","xplore-issue":"7821833","articleId":"7821878","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7821881,"authors":[{"name":"Ramiro S\u00e1mano-Robles","affiliation":["Research Centre in Real-time and Embedded Computing Systems, Porto, Portugal"],"firstName":"Ramiro","lastName":"S\u00e1mano-Robles","id":"38270506300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1535-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1536-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7821881","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":50},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Protocols","Receivers","Estimation","Channel state information","Signal resolution","Channel estimation","MIMO"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["diversity reception","multi-access systems","multiuser channels","radio receivers","radio transmitters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["network diversity multiple access","imperfect channel state information","CS!","receiver operational characteristic","channel estimation","packet collisions","signal-processing assisted random access protocols","NDMA","transmitters"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7821881","doi":"10.1109/RTUWO.2016.7821881","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RTUWO.2016.7821881","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7821833","publicationTitle":"2016 Advances in Wireless and Optical Communications (RTUWO)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 Advances in Wireless and Optical Communications (RTUWO)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7811901/7821833/07821881.pdf","startPage":"186","endPage":"191","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Network diversity multiple access with imperfect channel state information at the transmitter side","abstract":"Network diversity multiple access (NDMA) is the family of algorithms with the highest potential throughput in the literature of signal-processing assisted random access protocols. NDMA uses the concept of protocol-induced retransmissions to create an adaptive source of diversity. This diversity is used to resolve packet collisions employing signal separation tools without the explicit need (or as a complement) of a multiple antenna receiver. This paper proposes a further improvement on the performance of NDMA by allowing each terminal access to an outdated copy of its individual channel state information (CSI). Based on this decentralized CSI, each terminal conveniently decides to transmit only if the estimated channel gain surpasses a threshold that is optimized to maximize performance. This ensures that the probability of terminal presence detection, and thus the probability of correct estimation of the collision multiplicity are considerably improved at the receiver end. The paper is focused on the modelling of the receiver operational characteristic (ROC) of the terminal presence detector considering that the CSI used by each terminal is potentially inaccurate (outdated) due to feedback delay. The results indicate that when the correlation coefficient that describes the accuracy of the available CSI tends to zero (\u03c1 \u2192 0), the scheme degrades into the conventional NDMA. By contrast, when the quality of the channel state information improves (\u03c1 \u2192 1), the throughput can nearly achieve the nominal channel rate (minimum throughput penalty). The selection of the detector thresholds for channel gain and terminal presence is optimized to maximize system performance.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7821881/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-4 Nov. 2016","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"3-4 Nov. 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7821881/","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2017","publicationDate":"Nov. 2016","accessionNumber":"16604399","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Network diversity multiple access with imperfect channel state information at the transmitter side","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Network diversity multiple access with imperfect channel state information at the transmitter side","confLoc":"Riga, Latvia","sourcePdf":"p186-samano-robles.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065754S","chronDate":"3-4 Nov. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7811901","isNumber":"7821833","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7811901","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7821833","articleId":"7821881","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":7821884,"authors":[{"name":"Ali W.

Proper unit commitment is needed to acquire the generator scheduling plan with minimum total operating cost while also meeting the fuel contracts. Genetic algorithm based on priority list approach is used to solve unit commitment problem. Unit commitment without fuel constraint is simulated to obtain total operating cost and to check whether fuel used by take or pay units meet the constraint or not. Unit commitment with fuel constraint is solved by two methods: adding a constraint to the genetic algorithm and repairing power dispatch, especially in Lagrange function. This simulation is tested on a study case 25-unit system which consists of 10 take or pay units. Simulation results from unit commitment without and with fuel constraint is compared. Unit commitment with fuel constraint using repaired dispatch produces more optimum power output combination with better total operating cost.","doi":"10.1109/INAES.2016.7821950","startPage":"286","endPage":"291","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 6th International Annual Engineering Seminar (InAES)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7811904/7821890/07821950.pdf","publicationTitle":"2016 6th International Annual Engineering Seminar (InAES)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INAES.2016.7821950","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7821890","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Thermal unit commitment with fuel constraint using genetic algorithm","keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["contracts","electric generators","fuel","genetic algorithms","power systems","scheduling","thermal analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["thermal unit commitment","fuel constraint","genetic algorithm","power systems","fuel contracts","proper unit commitment","generator scheduling plan","power dispatch","Lagrange function","optimum power output combination"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["unit commitment","take or pay contract","fuel constraint","genetic algorithm","repaired Lagrange"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7821950/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-3 Aug. 2016","displayDocTitle":"Thermal unit commitment with fuel constraint using genetic algorithm","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7821950/","publicationDate":"Aug. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2017","conferenceDate":"1-3 Aug. 2016","accessionNumber":"16616904","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Thermal unit commitment with fuel constraint using genetic algorithm","confLoc":"Yogyakarta, Indonesia","sourcePdf":"2016055_TS-55.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054028S","chronDate":"1-3 Aug. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7811904","isNumber":"7821890","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7811904","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7821890","articleId":"7821950","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-10"},{"_id":7821970,"authors":[{"name":"Marwa A.

Additionally, network congestion has been reported as a main bottleneck in multi-tenant data centers. In this paper, the problem of virtual machines allocation is tackled based on Software-Defined Network (SDN) resource allocation strategy. Moreover, several important parameters are taken into consideration that have been ignored in previous related studies. Another important imposing goal of this paper is to minimize the overall cost in cloud computing environments while allocating network resources. Simulation studies have been conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed strategy. Simulation results show a reduction in the utilization in the valuable upper-layer links in data centers which is resulted mainly from favoring the lower-cost links during the allocation process. Additionally, the proposed strategy is able to cope with the dynamic nature of allocation process. More importantly, it avoids false allocation in cloud computing environments.","publicationTitle":"2016 11th International Conference on Computer Engineering & Systems (ICCES)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 11th International Conference on Computer Engineering & Systems (ICCES)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7811900/7821952/07821970.pdf","startPage":"26","endPage":"31","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Network-aware resource management strategy in cloud computing environments","doi":"10.1109/ICCES.2016.7821970","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7821952","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCES.2016.7821970","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7821970","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7821970/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-21 Dec. 2016","displayDocTitle":"Network-aware resource management strategy in cloud computing environments","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2017","publicationDate":"Dec. 2016","accessionNumber":"16604364","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"20-21 Dec. 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7821970/","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Network-aware resource management strategy in cloud computing environments","confLoc":"Cairo, Egypt","sourcePdf":"01_4_93.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.080073S","chronDate":"20-21 Dec. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7811900","isNumber":"7821952","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7811900","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"7821952","articleId":"7821970","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-18"},{"_id":7821982,"authors":[{"name":"Ahmed H.

Computers can be employed to solve this problem faster and to produce better solutions. Software solutions for this problem already exist and are used by some universities. However, some universities have complex types of constraints that make it hard to use most of the available software solutions. This paper introduces a software solution for the curriculum based timetabling problem with flexibility to include some complex types of constraints. In addition, the solution provided here allows for incremental changes when new constraints are added after generating the timetable. The solution is based on the genetic algorithm with some modifications to some of the operators to enhance the algorithm. The preliminary results show that it is possible to represent some complex constraint types. Also, that incremental changes can be implemented to reach a close solution faster. It is also shown that the operators of the genetic algorithm can be modified to better suit the timetabling problem and produce better results.","doi":"10.1109/ICCES.2016.7821985","startPage":"122","endPage":"127","publicationTitle":"2016 11th International Conference on Computer Engineering & Systems (ICCES)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCES.2016.7821985","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7821952","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 11th International Conference on Computer Engineering & Systems (ICCES)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7811900/7821952/07821985.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An enhanced genetic algorithm-based timetabling system with incremental changes","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7821985/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"An enhanced genetic algorithm-based timetabling system with incremental changes","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7821985/","accessionNumber":"16604355","publicationDate":"Dec. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2017","conferenceDate":"20-21 Dec. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-21 Dec. 2016","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An enhanced genetic algorithm-based timetabling system with incremental changes","confLoc":"Cairo, Egypt","sourcePdf":"03_5_66.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070259S","chronDate":"20-21 Dec. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7811900","isNumber":"7821952","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7811900","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7821952","articleId":"7821985","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":7822002,"authors":[{"name":"Taysir Hassan A.

The use of the less complex Min-Sum algorithm on the suggested architecture produces a very compact and resource efficient design which allows the instantiation of many processing elements to deliver high processing rate To allow flexibility to support different codes, a non-blocking interconnection network is used to pass messages between processing elements. It is a modified version of the multi stage network called Arbitrary Size Benes. The decoder architecture was implemented on Virtex5 FPGA using VHDL in Xilinx ISE environment.

Triple Modular Redundancy (TMR) is used to implement sensors for fast varying applications while Temporal Redundancy (TR) is used for sensors for slow varying applications in order to reduce cost without affecting system reliability. Dynamic Partial Reconfiguration (DPR) is used for fault recovery. Reliability models are developed for all Fault-Tolerant blocks to help system designers with the choice of the Fault-Tolerant techniques to be implemented. Two case studies are carried out with different numbers of fast and slow sensors. System reliabilities are calculated for both conventional and hybrid NCS systems. Results show that the proposed technique results in a cost-effective system at the expense of a very slight decrease in reliability.","doi":"10.1109/ICCES.2016.7822018","publicationTitle":"2016 11th International Conference on Computer Engineering & Systems (ICCES)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 11th International Conference on Computer Engineering & Systems (ICCES)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7811900/7821952/07822018.pdf","startPage":"299","endPage":"304","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCES.2016.7822018","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7821952","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7822018","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Integration of Multiple Fault-Tolerant techniques for FPGA-based NCS Nodes","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-21 Dec. 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7822018/","displayDocTitle":"Integration of Multiple Fault-Tolerant techniques for FPGA-based NCS Nodes","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7822018/","publicationDate":"Dec. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2017","conferenceDate":"20-21 Dec. 2016","accessionNumber":"16616637","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Integration of Multiple Fault-Tolerant techniques for FPGA-based NCS Nodes","confLoc":"Cairo, Egypt","sourcePdf":"07_5_94.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.084825S","chronDate":"20-21 Dec. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7811900","isNumber":"7821952","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7811900","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"7821952","articleId":"7822018","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-18"},{"_id":7822026,"authors":[{"name":"Cheikh Brahim Rabany","affiliation":["Ecole Superieure Polytechnique (ESP), Universite Cheikh Anta DIOP (UCAD), Dakar, SENEGAL"],"firstName":"Cheikh Brahim","lastName":"Rabany","id":"37086091529"},{"name":"Ibra Dioum","affiliation":["Ecole Superieure Polytechnique (ESP), Universite Cheikh Anta DIOP (UCAD), Dakar, SENEGAL"],"firstName":"Ibra","lastName":"Dioum","id":"37601592000"},{"name":"Ahmed Dooguy Kora","affiliation":["Departement ESMT TIC (DETIC), Ecole Superieure Multinationale des Telecommunications, Dakar, SENEGAL"],"firstName":"Ahmed Dooguy","lastName":"Kora","id":"38238751100"},{"name":"Zacharia Damoue","affiliation":["Departement ESMT TIC (DETIC), Ecole Superieure Multinationale des Telecommunications, Dakar, SENEGAL"],"firstName":"Zacharia","lastName":"Damoue","id":"37086088891"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3267-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3266-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3268-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7822026","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":51},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Relays","Optical fiber communication","Modulation","Wireless communication","Optical transmitters","Adaptive optics","Optical attenuators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decode and forward communication","free-space optical communication","light transmission","pulse position modulation","relay networks (telecommunication)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["relay limits","wireless optical communications networks","wireless optical transmission","relays schemes","free space optics","FSO","wireless communication range extension","communication link","decode and forward relays","multipulse position modulation","MPPM"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["OOK","PPM","MPPM","wireless","FSO","optical"]}],"abstract":"Turbulence is one key limitation factor of wireless optical transmission.

To achieve these benefits of the massive MIMO, there are many challenges that need to be handled. One of these challenges is the pilot contamination problem that arises from reusing pilot sequences among the system cells. Since this problem is considered as a bottleneck of the system performance, it attracted many researchers who proposed schemes to solve it. In this paper, we propose a new scheme that mitigates its effect by adopting both asynchronous pilot transmission (APT) and fractional pilot reuse (FPR). We compare the performance of our proposed scheme with other schemes using computer simulations and show that our proposed scheme enhances the performance of the time division duplex (TDD) multi-cell massive MIMO systems in terms of the signal to interference and noise ratio (SINR) and capacity.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A novel vision to mitigate pilot contamination in massive MIMO-based 5G networks","publicationTitle":"2016 11th International Conference on Computer Engineering & Systems (ICCES)","doi":"10.1109/ICCES.2016.7822031","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 11th International Conference on Computer Engineering & Systems (ICCES)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7811900/7821952/07822031.pdf","startPage":"366","endPage":"371","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCES.2016.7822031","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7821952","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7822031","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7822031/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-21 Dec. 2016","displayDocTitle":"A novel vision to mitigate pilot contamination in massive MIMO-based 5G networks","conferenceDate":"20-21 Dec. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7822031/","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2017","publicationDate":"Dec. 2016","accessionNumber":"16616611","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A novel vision to mitigate pilot contamination in massive MIMO-based 5G networks","confLoc":"Cairo, Egypt","sourcePdf":"09_3_69.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065646S","chronDate":"20-21 Dec. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7811900","isNumber":"7821952","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7811900","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7821952","articleId":"7822031","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7822038,"authors":[{"name":"Osama H.

OFDM suffers from high Peak-to-Average Power Ratio (PAPR), which limits OFDM usage and reduces the efficiency of High Power Amplifier (HPA) or badly degrades BER. Many PAPR reduction techniques have been proposed in the literature. PAPR reduction techniques can be classified into blind receiver and non-blind receiver techniques. Active Constellation Extension (ACE) is one of the best blind receiver techniques. While, Partial Transmit Sequence (PTS) can work as blind / non-blind technique. PTS has a great PAPR reduction gain on the expense of increasing computational complexity. In this paper we combine PTS with ACE in four possible ways to be suitable for blind receiver applications with better performance than conventional methods (i.e. PTS and ACE). Results show that ACE-PTS scheme is the best among others. Expectedly, any hybrid technique has computational complexity larger than that of its components. However, ACE-PTS can be used to achieve the same performance as that of PTS or worthy better, with less number of subblocks (i.e. with less computational complexity) especially in low order modulation techniques (e.g. 4-QAM and 16-QAM). Results show that ACE-PTS with V=8 can perform similar to or better than PTS with V=10 in 16-QAM or 4-QAM, respectively, with 74% and 40.5% reduction in required numbers of additions and multiplications, respectively.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"20-21 Dec. 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7822039/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"16616639","publicationDate":"Dec. 2016","conferenceDate":"20-21 Dec. 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7822039/","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Performance evaluation of hybrid ACE-PTS PAPR reduction techniques","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance evaluation of hybrid ACE-PTS PAPR reduction techniques","confLoc":"Cairo","sourcePdf":"10_3_40.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05074S","chronDate":"20-21 Dec. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7811900","isNumber":"7821952","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7811900","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"7821952","articleId":"7822039","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-11"},{"_id":7822106,"authors":[{"name":"L.

ASTRO-DF algorithms are iterative trust-region algorithms, where a local model is repeatedly constructed and optimized as iterates evolve through the search space. The ASTRO-DF class of algorithms is derivative-free in the sense that it does not rely on direct observations of the function derivatives. A salient feature of ASTRO-DF is the incorporation of adaptive sampling and replication to keep the model error and the trust-region radius in lock-step, to ensure efficiency. ASTRO-DF has been demonstrated to generate iterates that globally converge to a first-order critical point with probability one. In this paper, we describe and list ASTRO-DF, and discuss key heuristics that ensure good finite-time performance. We report our numerical experience with ASTRO-DF on test problems in low to moderate dimensions.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7822121/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 Dec. 2016","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"11-14 Dec. 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7822121/","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2017","publicationDate":"Dec. 2016","accessionNumber":"16604432","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"ASTRO-DF: Adaptive sampling trust-region optimization algorithms, heuristics, and numerical experience","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"ASTRO-DF: Adaptive sampling trust-region optimization algorithms, heuristics, and numerical experience","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"050.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053098S","chronDate":"11-14 Dec. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7811902","isNumber":"7822058","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7811902","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7822058","articleId":"7822121","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":7822318,"authors":[{"name":"Mirko K\u00fcck","affiliation":["Faculty of Production Engineering, GmbH at the University of Bremen Hochschulring 20, Bremen, GERMANY"],"bio":{"p":["Mirko Kuck is a research scientist at the BIBA - Bremer Institut f\u00fcr Produktion und Logistik at the University of Bremen, Germany.

These systems are subject to dynamic influences and demand increasing effort for the generation of feasible production schedules and process control. This paper presents an approach for dealing with these challenges. First, production scheduling is executed by coupling an optimization heuristic with a simulation model. Second, real-time system state data, to be provided by forthcoming cyber-physical systems, is fed back, so that the simulation model is continuously updated and the optimization heuristic can either adjust an existing schedule or generate a new one. The potential of the approach was tested by means of a use case embracing a semiconductor manufacturing facility, in which the simulation results were employed to support the selection of better dispatching rules, improving flexible manufacturing systems performance regarding the average production cycle time.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7822318/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 Dec. 2016","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"11-14 Dec. 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7822318/","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2017","publicationDate":"Dec. 2016","accessionNumber":"16604521","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Potential of data-driven simulation-based optimization for adaptive scheduling and control of dynamic manufacturing systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Potential of data-driven simulation-based optimization for adaptive scheduling and control of dynamic manufacturing systems","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"248.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.128272S","chronDate":"11-14 Dec. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7811902","isNumber":"7822058","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7811902","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"7822058","articleId":"7822318","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":7822444,"authors":[{"name":"Jongmin Yu","affiliation":["Machine Learning and Vision Laboratory, Gwangju Institute of Science and Technology, Gwangju, Republic of Korea"],"firstName":"Jongmin","lastName":"Yu","id":"37085574898"},{"name":"Jeonghwan Gwak","affiliation":["Machine Learning and Vision Laboratory, Gwangju Institute of Science and Technology, Gwangju, Republic of Korea"],"firstName":"Jeonghwan","lastName":"Gwak","id":"37085511610"},{"name":"Moongu Jeon","affiliation":["Machine Learning and Vision Laboratory, Gwangju Institute of Science and Technology, Gwangju, Republic of Korea"],"firstName":"Moongu","lastName":"Jeon","id":"37666359200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-0650-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-0651-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7822444","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":272},"abstract":"This paper presents a Gaussian-Poisson mixture model (GPMM) which can reflect a frequency of event occurrence, for detecting anomaly of crowd behaviours.

In this study, we propose to use deep learning methods to extract high representative global features and then automatically detect secondary structures of proteins. In particular, we build a convolutional neural network (CNN) classifier that predicts the probability of label for every individual voxel in 3D cryo-EM image with respect to the secondary structure elements of proteins such as \u03b1-helix, \u03b2-sheet and background. To effectively incorporate the 3D spatial information in protein structures, we propose to perform 3D convolutions in the convolutional layers of CNNs.

Through alternative splicing, gene can express multiple isoforms. The next generation of high-throughput RNA sequencing has provided facilitation for quantifying isoform expression level. Extensive efforts have been made in stimulating isoform abundance from RNA-Seq data, but the accuracy still needs to be improved. In this article, we propose a statistical method combined with Particle Swarm Optimization to estimate isoform abundance from RNA-Seq data. After a series of statistical analysis and experiments, we decided on the forms and values of coefficients in Particle Swarm Optimization model. We analyzed the performance of our approach on both simulated and real datasets. Experiment results showed that comparing to Cufflinks our approach makes acceptable improvement on accuracy and is more sensitive to condition changes in most cases.","doi":"10.1109/BIBM.2016.7822512","startPage":"161","endPage":"166","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE International Conference on Bioinformatics and Biomedicine (BIBM)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7811899/7822470/07822512.pdf","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE International Conference on Bioinformatics and Biomedicine (BIBM)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/BIBM.2016.7822512","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7822470","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Estimating isoform abundance by Particle Swarm Optimization","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Particle swarm optimization","Mathematical model","Linear programming","Correlation","Sequential analysis","Computer science","Statistical analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biology computing","genetics","genomics","molecular biophysics","particle swarm optimisation","proteins","RNA","statistical analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["isoform abundance estimation","particle swarm optimization","protein","gene expression","RNA sequencing","isoform expression level","RNA-Seq data","statistical method"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7822512/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-18 Dec. 2016","displayDocTitle":"Estimating isoform abundance by Particle Swarm Optimization","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7822512/","publicationDate":"Dec. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2017","conferenceDate":"15-18 Dec. 2016","accessionNumber":"16604113","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Estimating isoform abundance by Particle Swarm Optimization","confLoc":"Shenzhen","sourcePdf":"0039_B347.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06038S","chronDate":"15-18 Dec. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7811899","isNumber":"7822470","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7811899","xplore-issue":"7822470","articleId":"7822512","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":7822545,"authors":[{"name":"Xiang Li","affiliation":["School of Computing and Communications, The Open University, United Kindom","Tianjin Key Laboratory of Cognitive Computing and Application, Tianjin University, China"],"firstName":"Xiang","lastName":"Li","id":"37085880303"},{"name":"Dawei Song","affiliation":["Tianjin Key Laboratory of Cognitive Computing and Application, Tianjin University, China"],"firstName":"Dawei","lastName":"Song","id":"37085877601"},{"name":"Peng Zhang","affiliation":["Tianjin Key Laboratory of Cognitive Computing and Application, Tianjin University, China"],"firstName":"Peng","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37652265600"},{"name":"Guangliang Yu","affiliation":["Tianjin University, Tianjin, Tianjin, CN"],"firstName":"Guangliang","lastName":"Yu","id":"37085882054"},{"name":"Yuexian Hou","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Engineering, Lanzhou University, China"],"firstName":"Yuexian","lastName":"Hou","id":"37555869000"},{"name":"Bin Hu","affiliation":["Tianjin Key Laboratory of Cognitive Computing and Application, Tianjin University, China"],"firstName":"Bin","lastName":"Hu","id":"37307887900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1611-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1612-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7822545","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":52,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":3327},"abstract":"Automatic emotion recognition based on multi-channel neurophysiological signals, as a challenging pattern recognition task, is becoming an important computer-aided method for emotional disorder diagnoses in neurology and psychiatry. Traditional approaches require designing and extracting a range of features from single or multiple channel signals based on extensive domain knowledge. This may be an obstacle for non-domain experts. Moreover, traditional feature fusion method can not fully utilize correlation information between different channels. In this paper, we propose a preprocessing method that encapsulates the multi-channel neurophysiological signals into grid-like frames through wavelet and scalogram transform. We further design a hybrid deep learning model that combines the `Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)' and `Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)', for extracting task-related features, mining inter-channel correlation and incorporating contextual information from those frames. Experiments are carried out, in a trial-level emotion recognition task, on the DEAP benchmarking dataset. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods, with respect to the emotional dimensions of Valence and Arousal.","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE International Conference on Bioinformatics and Biomedicine (BIBM)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7811899/7822470/07822545.pdf","startPage":"352","endPage":"359","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE International Conference on Bioinformatics and Biomedicine (BIBM)","doi":"10.1109/BIBM.2016.7822545","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/BIBM.2016.7822545","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7822470","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7822545","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Emotion recognition from multi-channel EEG data through Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Emotion recognition","Electroencephalography","Feature extraction","Continuous wavelet transforms","Correlation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data mining","electroencephalography","emotion recognition","feature extraction","medical disorders","medical signal processing","neurophysiology","wavelet transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multichannel EEG data","convolutional recurrent neural network","automatic emotion recognition","multichannel neurophysiological signals","pattern recognition task","computer-aided method","emotional disorder diagnoses","neurology","psychiatry","single channel signals","multiple channel signals","extensive domain knowledge","nondomain experts","scalogram transform","wavelet transform","grid-like frames","hybrid deep learning model","convolutional neural network","recurrent neural network","CNN","RNN","task-related feature extraction","interchannel correlation mining","contextual information","trial-level emotion recognition task","DEAP benchmarking dataset","valence-and-arousal","emotional dimensions"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["CNN","EEG","emotion recognition","LSTM","physiological signal"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7822545/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-18 Dec. 2016","displayDocTitle":"Emotion recognition from multi-channel EEG data through Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7822545/","publicationDate":"Dec. 2016","accessionNumber":"16604093","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2017","conferenceDate":"15-18 Dec. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Emotion recognition from multi-channel EEG data through Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network","confLoc":"Shenzhen, China","sourcePdf":"0072_B454.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.075674S","chronDate":"15-18 Dec. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7811899","isNumber":"7822470","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7811899","citationCount":"52","xplore-issue":"7822470","articleId":"7822545","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":7822556,"authors":[{"name":"Chen Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Electronic and Computer Engineering, The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology"],"firstName":"Chen","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37086118666"},{"name":"Tianzhu Liang","affiliation":["Department of Biomedical Engineering, Shenzhen University","Shenzhen Mindray Bio-Medical Electronics Co., Ltd."],"firstName":"Tianzhu","lastName":"Liang","id":"37982742000"},{"name":"Philip K.T.

The standard way of diagnosing malaria is by visually examining blood smears for parasite-infected red blood cells under the microscope by qualified technicians. This method is inefficient and the diagnosis depends on the experience and the knowledge of the person doing the examination. Automatic image recognition technologies based on machine learning have been applied to malaria blood smears for diagnosis before. However, the practical performance has not been sufficient so far. This study proposes a new and robust machine learning model based on a convolutional neural network (CNN) to automatically classify single cells in thin blood smears on standard microscope slides as either infected or uninfected. In a ten-fold cross-validation based on 27,578 single cell images, the average accuracy of our new 16-layer CNN model is 97.37%. A transfer learning model only achieves 91.99% on the same images.

In this paper, we combine aEEG signals with Long-Short Time Memory (LSTM) model and propose a method to predict aEEG signals based on LSTM. All of the aEEG signals after preprocessing were used as the input of the LSTM, a type of recurrent neural networks which can process long term signals with high accuracy. To assess the method, several experiments were conducted on 276 neonatal aEEG tracings including 217 normal cases and 59 abnormal ones. Experimental results show that the predicted aEEG signals are very close to the real aEEG signals.

The current mainstream methods for event extraction are based on shallow machine learning methods. However, these methods mainly rely on domain experience and need enormous manual efforts to select features. Therefore, we propose a novel Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) Networks framework DETBLSTM for event extraction. In our framework, a dynamic extended tree is introduced as the input instead of the original sentences, which utilizes the syntactic information. Furthermore, the POS and distance embeddings are added to enrich input information and thus the complex feature extraction can be skipped. In final, we construct a bidirectional LSTM model to extract biomedical events and achieve 57.14% F-score in the test set. Our model obtains a better F-score than all official submissions to BioNLP-ST 2016, which is 1.34% higher than the best system.","doi":"10.1109/BIBM.2016.7822612","startPage":"739","endPage":"742","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE International Conference on Bioinformatics and Biomedicine (BIBM)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/BIBM.2016.7822612","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7822470","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE International Conference on Bioinformatics and Biomedicine (BIBM)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7811899/7822470/07822612.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Biomedical event extraction via Long Short Term Memory networks along dynamic extended tree","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7822612/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Biomedical event extraction via Long Short Term Memory networks along dynamic extended tree","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7822612/","accessionNumber":"16604045","publicationDate":"Dec. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2017","conferenceDate":"15-18 Dec. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-18 Dec. 2016","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Biomedical event extraction via Long Short Term Memory networks along dynamic extended tree","confLoc":"Shenzhen, China","sourcePdf":"0139_B273.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.090158S","chronDate":"15-18 Dec. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7811899","isNumber":"7822470","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7811899","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"7822470","articleId":"7822612","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-12"},{"_id":7822616,"authors":[{"name":"Johan Peltenburg","affiliation":["Computer Engineering Laboratory, Delft, TU"],"firstName":"Johan","lastName":"Peltenburg","id":"37086093384"},{"name":"Shanshan Ren","affiliation":["Computer Engineering Laboratory, Delft, TU"],"firstName":"Shanshan","lastName":"Ren","id":"37086089292"},{"name":"Zaid Al-Ars","affiliation":["Computer Engineering Laboratory, Delft, TU"],"firstName":"Zaid","lastName":"Al-Ars","id":"38278163800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1611-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1612-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7822616","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":15,"totalDownloads":229},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hidden Markov models","Field programmable gate arrays","Algorithm design and analysis","Throughput","Arrays","DNA"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bioinformatics","data analysis","DNA","field programmable gate arrays","genomics","hidden Markov models","molecular biophysics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["systolic array efficiency","PairHMM forward algorithm","DNA sequencing data analysis","hidden Markov model","reference genome","PairHMM model","FPGA implementation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["High-Throughput Sequencing","GATK","Haplotype-Caller","PairHMM","Systolic Array","FPGA"]}],"abstract":"In the analysis of next-generation DNA sequencing data, Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) are used to perform variant calling between DNA sequences and a reference genome.

The parenchyma texture is modeled with Gaussian mixture model (GMM), and the lesions in the parenchyma are detected by a scale-space defect detection algorithm. The degree of pathological changes of the liver is quantitatively evaluated by 7 features describing morphology of the capsule and lesions in the parenchyma.

Besides DDIs reported in medical knowledge bases such as DrugBank, a large number of latest DDI findings are also reported in unstructured biomedical literature. Extracting DDIs from unstructured biomedical literature is a worthy addition to the existing knowledge bases. Currently, convolutional neural network (CNN) is a state-of-the-art method for DDI extraction. One limitation of CNN is that it neglects long distance dependencies between words in candidate DDI instances, which may be helpful for DDI extraction. In order to incorporate the long distance dependencies between words in candidate DDI instances, in this work, we propose a dependency-based convolutional neural network (DCNN) for DDI extraction. Experiments conducted on the DDIExtraction 2013 corpus show that DCNN using a public state-of-the-art dependency parser achieves an F-score of 70.19%, outperforming CNN by 0.44%. By analyzing errors of DCNN, we find that errors from dependency parsers are propagated into DCNN and affect the performance of DCNN. To reduce error propagation, we design a simple rule to combine CNN with DCNN, that is, using DCNN to extract DDIs in short sentences and CNN to extract DDIs in long distances as most dependency parsers work well for short sentences but bad for long sentences. Finally, our system that combines CNN and DCNN achieves an F-score of 70.81%, outperforming CNN by 1.06% and DNN by 0.62% on the DDIExtraction 2013 corpus.","doi":"10.1109/BIBM.2016.7822671","startPage":"1074","endPage":"1080","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE International Conference on Bioinformatics and Biomedicine (BIBM)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7811899/7822470/07822671.pdf","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE International Conference on Bioinformatics and Biomedicine (BIBM)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/BIBM.2016.7822671","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7822470","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dependency-based convolutional neural network for drug-drug interaction extraction","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Drugs","TV"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["drugs","feature extraction","health care","medical computing","neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dependency-based convolutional neural network","drug-drug interaction extraction","healthcare","medical knowledge bases","DrugBank","unstructured biomedical literature","DDIExtraction 2013 corpus","public state-of-the-art dependency parser","F-score"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Drug-drug interaction","Biomedical literature","Dependency-based convolutional neural network"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7822671/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-18 Dec. 2016","displayDocTitle":"Dependency-based convolutional neural network for drug-drug interaction extraction","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7822671/","publicationDate":"Dec. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2017","conferenceDate":"15-18 Dec. 2016","accessionNumber":"16604316","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dependency-based convolutional neural network for drug-drug interaction extraction","confLoc":"Shenzhen","sourcePdf":"0198_S03201.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.092009S","chronDate":"15-18 Dec. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7811899","isNumber":"7822470","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7811899","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"7822470","articleId":"7822671","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":7822672,"authors":[{"name":"Juan Antonio Lossio-Ventura","affiliation":["Health Outcomes & Policy, University of Florida, Gainesville, Florida, USA"],"firstName":"Juan Antonio","lastName":"Lossio-Ventura","id":"37086007631"},{"name":"William Hogan","affiliation":["Health Outcomes & Policy, University of Florida, Gainesville, Florida, USA"],"firstName":"William","lastName":"Hogan","id":"37085797671"},{"name":"Fran\u00e7ois Modave","affiliation":["Health Outcomes & Policy, University of Florida, Gainesville, Florida, USA"],"firstName":"Fran\u00e7ois","lastName":"Modave","id":"37329084200"},{"name":"Amanda Hicks","affiliation":["Health Outcomes & Policy, University of Florida, Gainesville, Florida, USA"],"firstName":"Amanda","lastName":"Hicks","id":"37086008458"},{"name":"Josh Hanna","affiliation":["Health Outcomes & Policy, University of Florida, Gainesville, Florida, USA"],"firstName":"Josh","lastName":"Hanna","id":"37086012949"},{"name":"Yi Guo","affiliation":["Health Outcomes & Policy, University of Florida, Gainesville, Florida, USA"],"lastName":"Yi Guo","id":"37087145307"},{"name":"Zhe He","affiliation":["Health Outcomes & Policy, University of Florida, Gainesville, Florida, USA"],"lastName":"Zhe He","id":"37087480153"},{"name":"Jiang Bian","affiliation":["Health Outcomes & Policy, University of Florida, Gainesville, Florida, USA"],"lastName":"Jiang Bian","id":"37087433768"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1611-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1612-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7822672","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":10,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":304},"abstract":"Obesity is associated with increased risks of various types of cancer, as well as a wide range of other chronic diseases. On the other hand, access to health information activates patient participation, and improve their health outcomes. However, existing online information on obesity and its relationship to cancer is heterogeneous ranging from pre-clinical models and case studies to mere hypothesis-based scientific arguments. A formal knowledge representation (i.e., a semantic knowledge base) would help better organizing and delivering quality health information related to obesity and cancer that consumers need. Nevertheless, current ontologies describing obesity, cancer and related entities are not designed to guide automatic knowledge base construction from heterogeneous information sources. Thus, in this paper, we present methods for named-entity recognition (NER) to extract biomedical entities from scholarly articles and for detecting if two biomedical entities are related, with the long term goal of building a obesity-cancer knowledge base. We leverage both linguistic and statistical approaches in the NER task, which supersedes the state-of-the-art results. Further, based on statistical features extracted from the sentences, our method for relation detection obtains an accuracy of 99.3% and a f-measure of 0.993.","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE

Most of preview disease analysis researches were conducted on structured dataset, which usually ignored the relationship between different symptoms, and the dataset was expensive to get. In this paper, we proposed a novel model based on Word2vec and Terms Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF), which could be used to detect damp-heat syndrome on unstructured records directly. Firstly, we adopt ICTCLAS system combined with corpus collected in the field of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) to segment the clinical records into words. Secondly, Word2vec tool was used to train word vector. Then, we constructed the record representation vector according to word vector and TF-IDF. The record representation method was named Word2vec+TF-IDF. In order to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, we compared our record representation method with other text representation methods under four different classifiers. The experiment was conducted on the dataset collected from over 10 Chinese Medicine hospitals. And the experimental results show that our model perform better than the state-of-the-art methods such as LSA and Doc2vec.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7822730/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-18 Dec. 2016","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"15-18 Dec. 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7822730/","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2017","publicationDate":"Dec. 2016","accessionNumber":"16604237","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A study of damp-heat syndrome classification using Word2vec and TF-IDF","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A study of damp-heat syndrome classification using Word2vec and TF-IDF","confLoc":"Shenzhen","sourcePdf":"0258_B252.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050515S","chronDate":"15-18 Dec. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7811899","isNumber":"7822470","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7811899","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"7822470","articleId":"7822730","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":7822751,"authors":[{"name":"Zhiyong Yang","affiliation":["Department of Computer, University of Science and Technology Beijing (USTB), Beijing, China","Beijing Key Laboratory of Knowledge Engineering for Materials Science, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Zhiyong Yang","id":"37086187467"},{"name":"Jingcheng Lu","affiliation":["Department of Computer, University of Science and Technology Beijing (USTB), Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Jingcheng Lu","id":"37086193280"},{"name":"Taohong Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Computer, University of Science and Technology Beijing (USTB), Beijing, China","Beijing Key Laboratory of Knowledge Engineering for Materials Science, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Taohong","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37086187622"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1611-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1612-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7822751","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":147},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Heart","Glass","Training","Support vector machines","Algorithm design and analysis","Diabetes","Kernel"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bioinformatics","data analysis","learning (artificial intelligence)","medical computing","pattern classification","support vector machines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["extreme large margin distribution machine","classification methods","biomedical data analysis","bioinformatical data analysis","data acquisition","small-scale datasets","SVM-like algorithms","training dataset","overall generalization ability","LDM","machine learning algorithm","extreme learning machine","ELM","margin distribution optimization","biomedical classification datasets"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7822751","abstract":"Classification methods has become increasingly popular for biomedical and bioinformatical data analysis. However, due to the difficulty of data acquisition, sometimes we could only obtain small-scale datasets which may leads to unreasonable generalization performances. For SVM-like algorithms, we could resort to Large Margin theory to find out solutions for such dilemma. Recent studies on large margin theory show that, besides maximizing the minimum margin of a given training dataset, it is also necessary to optimization the margin distribution to boost the overall generalization ability. Correspondingly, a novel SVM-like algorithm called Large Margin Distribution Machine (LDM) realizes this idea by maximizing the average of margin and minimizing the variance of margin simultaneously. And a series of applications has been reported thereafter. There is another well-known machine learning algorithm called Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) which shares similar framework with SVM. It is believed in this paper ELM could also benefit from the virtues of margin distribution optimization. Bearing this in mind, a novel algorithm called Extreme Large Margin Distribution Machine(ELDM) is proposed in this paper by bridging the advantages of ELM and LDM. And an efficient extension of ELDM for multi-class classifications under One vs. All Scheme is proposed subsequently. Finally, the experiment results on both benchmark datasets and biomedical classification datasets show the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7822470","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE International Conference on Bioinformatics and Biomedicine (BIBM)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE International Conference on Bioinformatics and Biomedicine (BIBM)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7811899/7822470/07822751.pdf","doi":"10.1109/BIBM.2016.7822751","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/BIBM.2016.7822751","startPage":"1549","endPage":"1554","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Extreme Large Margin Distribution Machine and its applications for biomedical datasets","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"15-18 Dec. 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7822751/","displayDocTitle":"Extreme Large Margin Distribution Machine and its applications for biomedical datasets","htmlLink":"/document/7822751/","conferenceDate":"15-18 Dec. 2016","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"16604313","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2017","publicationDate":"Dec. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Extreme Large Margin Distribution Machine and its applications for biomedical datasets","confLoc":"Shenzhen, China","sourcePdf":"0279_B210.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.13536S","chronDate":"15-18 Dec. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7811899","isNumber":"7822470","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7811899","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7822470","articleId":"7822751","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-09"},{"_id":7822767,"authors":[{"name":"Tong Ruan","affiliation":["East China University of Science and Technology, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Tong","lastName":"Ruan","id":"37086140483"},{"name":"Mengjie Wang","affiliation":["East China University of Science and Technology, Shanghai, China"],"lastName":"Mengjie Wang","id":"37086140084"},{"name":"Jian Sun","affiliation":["East China University of Science and Technology, Shanghai, China"],"lastName":"Jian Sun","id":"37086141603"},{"name":"Ting Wang","affiliation":["East China University of Science and Technology, Shanghai, China"],"lastName":"Ting Wang","id":"37086140271"},{"name":"Lu Zeng","affiliation":["East China University of Science and Technology, Shanghai, China"],"lastName":"Lu Zeng","id":"37086140415"},{"name":"Yichao Yin","affiliation":["Shanghai Shuguang Hospital, Shanghai, China"],"lastName":"Yichao Yin","id":"37086141105"},{"name":"Ju Gao","affiliation":["Shanghai Shuguang Hospital, Shanghai, China"],"lastName":"Ju Gao","id":"37086141457"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1611-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1612-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7822767","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":253},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Manuals","Knowledge based systems","Uniform resource locators","Encyclopedias","Electronic publishing","Internet"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["diseases","electronic health records","health care","knowledge based systems","medical computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["medical knowledge base","linked open data","electronic medical records","clinical diagnosis","data fusion","mainstream healthcare websites","Chinese encyclopedia sites","traditional Chinese medicine","diseases","unified medical language system"]}],"abstract":"While a large number of well-known knowledge bases (KBs) in life science have been published as Linked Open Data, there are few KBs in Chinese.

Of all, the symptom KB in Chinese is the most seriously in need, since symptoms are the starting point of clinical diagnosis. Furthermore, expressions used in describing symptoms in clinical practice are diverse, which makes it hard to collect such a KB. In this paper, we publish a public KB of symptoms in Chinese. The KB is constructed by fusing data automatically extracted from eight mainstream healthcare websites, three Chinese encyclopedia sites, and symptoms extracted from a large number of EMRs as supplements. As a result, the KB has more than 26,000 distinct symptoms in Chinese including 3,968 symptoms in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) and 1,029 synonym pairs for symptoms. The KB also includes concepts such as diseases and medicines as well as relations between symptoms and the above related entities.

It has been widely recognized that dysfunctional phosphorylation modifications are related to cancer. Specifically, some single amino acid variations could disrupt existing phosphorylation kinase-substrate relationships and create novel kinase-substrate relationships. Besides, numerous network-based methods have been proposed to identify meaningful disease modules, which are locally dense subnetworks. In this work, we proposed a new network clustering method to uncover disease modules, which are correlated with the specific disease, based on significance of connections instead of local density. Specially, we build a weighted tumor network of lung adenocarcinoma with kinase-substrate relationships, tissue-specific gene regulatory network, pairwise gene expression data and mutation data. With appropriate parameters decided by a machine learning method, our method identified 9 disease modules. We found that these disease modules could effectively discriminate tumor samples from normal samples. Some significantly important genes in these modules have been identified as target genes of drugs recently. Our results provide insights into the disease mechanism underlying, and help identify more target genes of drugs in the era of precision medicine.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A disease module detection algorithm for lung adenocarcinoma tumor network with significance of connections and network controllability methodology","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE International Conference on Bioinformatics and Biomedicine (BIBM)","doi":"10.1109/BIBM.2016.7822797","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE International Conference on Bioinformatics and Biomedicine (BIBM)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7811899/7822470/07822797.pdf","startPage":"1834","endPage":"1840","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/BIBM.2016.7822797","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7822470","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7822797","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7822797/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-18 Dec. 2016","displayDocTitle":"A disease module detection algorithm for lung adenocarcinoma tumor network with significance of connections and network controllability methodology","conferenceDate":"15-18 Dec. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7822797/","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2017","publicationDate":"Dec. 2016","accessionNumber":"16604253","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A disease module detection algorithm for lung adenocarcinoma tumor network with significance of connections and network controllability methodology","confLoc":"Shenzhen, China","sourcePdf":"0325_S21204.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.091305S","chronDate":"15-18 Dec. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7811899","isNumber":"7822470","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7811899","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7822470","articleId":"7822797","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7822896,"authors":[{"name":"Shuo He","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Networking and Switching Technology, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Shuo","lastName":"He","orcid":"0000-0002-5593-5829","id":"37086195177"},{"name":"Hui Tian","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Networking and Switching Technology, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Hui","lastName":"Tian","id":"37287120100"},{"name":"Xinchen Lyu","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Networking and Switching Technology, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Xinchen","lastName":"Lyu","orcid":"0000-0003-0404-4310","id":"37085784609"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-7798"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2558"},{"format":"CD","value":"2373-7891"}],"articleNumber":"7822896","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":16,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":951},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Social network services","Mathematical model","Predictive models","Sociology","Statistics","Markov processes","Big data"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Popularity prediction","edge caching","SIR model","discrete-time Markov Chain"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7822896","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/4234/7921536/07822896.pdf","startPage":"1027","endPage":"1030","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LCOMM.2017.2655038","doi":"10.1109/LCOMM.2017.2655038","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7921536","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Edge Popularity Prediction Based on Social-Driven Propagation Dynamics","abstract":"Caching contents in edge networks can reduce latency and lighten the burden on backhaul links. Since the capacity of cache nodes is limited, accurate content popularity distribution is crucial to the effectual usage of cache capacity. However, existing popularity prediction models stem from big data and, hence, may suffer poor accuracy due to the small population in edge caching. In this letter, we propose a social-driven propagation dynamics-based prediction model, which requires neither training phases nor prior knowledge. Specifically, we first explore social relationships to bridge the gap between small population and prediction accuracy under susceptible-infected-recovery model. Then, a discrete-time markov chain approach is proposed to predict the viewing probability of certain contents from the perspective of individuals. Simulations validate that our proposed model outperforms other solutions significantly, by improving up to 94% in accuracy and 99% less runtime overhead.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7822896/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 January 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2017","volume":"21","issue":"5","dateOfInsertion":"08 May 2017","publicationDate":"May 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7822896/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Edge Popularity Prediction Based on Social-Driven Propagation Dynamics","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61471060"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Edge Popularity Prediction Based on Social-Driven Propagation Dynamics","sourcePdf":"lcomm-tian-2655038-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.048016S","chronDate":"May  2017","xplore-pub-id":"4234","isNumber":"7921536","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4234","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"7921536","articleId":"7822896","onlineDate":"18 January 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Letter","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7822898,"authors":[{"name":"M.

In fact, the level of eddy current losses is strongly correlated with the manner of disposition of coil conductors in machine slots. Then, to improve the efficiency in electric machines, the selection of an optimal winding configuration becomes substantial. Since eddy current losses derive from the strong electromagnetic coupling between current density and time-dependent magnetic field, which cannot be solved easily, numerical analyses, such as particularly the one using the finite element (FE) method, are often used. As for the FE modeling, it can employ moving band technique to perform the rotor motion and Newton-Raphson iterations to deal with the nonlinear behavior of magnetic circuits. It leads then to a substantial computational time that hinders any process of conception or optimization of winding geometries. To overcome this issue, a 2-D FE model reduction based on the perturbation method is proposed. It starts from one approximate FE solution of a simplified complete machine modeling to find fast but accurate solutions in slots subdomains when any variation of geometrical or physical data occurs. It allows adapting nonconforming meshes and provides clear advantages in repetitive analyses when we search the optimized winding configuration for a given number of turns.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","pdfPath":"/iel7/20/7934107/07822898.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","doi":"10.1109/TMAG.2017.2655339","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMAG.2017.2655339","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7934107","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7822898","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Perturbation Finite Element Method for Efficient Copper Losses Calculation in Switched Reluctance Machines","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Conductors","Eddy currents","Windings","Current density","Copper","Magnetic circuits","Magnetic fields"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["coils","eddy current losses","electromagnetic coupling","finite element analysis","machine windings","Newton-Raphson method","reluctance machines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["finite element method","copper losses calculation","switched reluctance machines","electric machine windings","ohmic DC losses","AC eddy current losses","coil conductor disposition","machine slots","electromagnetic coupling","current density","time-dependent magnetic field","rotor motion","Newton-Raphson iterations","magnetic circuits","2D FE model reduction","machine modeling"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Boundary conditions (BCs)","eddy currents","finite-element analyses","perturbation method","switched reluctance machine (SRM)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7822898/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 January 2017","displayDocTitle":"Perturbation Finite Element Method for Efficient Copper Losses Calculation in Switched Reluctance Machines","volume":"53","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/7822898/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"June 2017","accessionNumber":"16914053","dateOfInsertion":"25 May 2017","externalId":"7202004","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Perturbation Finite Element Method for Efficient Copper Losses Calculation in Switched Reluctance Machines","sourcePdf":"tmag-aleit-2655339-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.068883S","chronDate":"June  2017","xplore-pub-id":"20","isNumber":"7934107","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"20","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"7934107","articleId":"7822898","onlineDate":"18 January 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7822907,"authors":[{"name":"Sergio Bernab\u00e9","affiliation":["Complutense University, Madrid, Spain"],"firstName":"Sergio","lastName":"Bernab\u00e9","orcid":"0000-0001-9916-0634","id":"38235772200"},{"name":"Guillermo Botella","affiliation":["Complutense University, Madrid, Spain"],"firstName":"Guillermo","lastName":"Botella","id":"37573177100"},{"name":"Jos\u00e9 M.

Many of them have been developed to solve the most time-consuming and relevant step: endmember extraction. However, unmixing algorithms can be computationally very expensive in terms of processing time and energy consumption, a fact that compromises their use in applications under real-time and energy/power constraints. In this letter, we present a new parallel simplex growing algorithm (SGA) for hyperspectral data which exploits the memory hierarchy with operations in single-precision floating point. Those optimizations accelerate the most time-consuming parts of this method using the open computing language (OpenCL) standard. We have evaluated the performance versus energy consumption using the same open standard for parallel programming over a diverse set of heterogeneous platforms. Experiments have been conducted using real hyperspectral images collected by NASA's Airborne Visible Infrared Imaging Spectrometer and a collection of 24 synthetic hyperspectral images simulated with different sizes and number of endmembers (10-30). Considering the power consumption and OpenCL across all the proposed devices, the analysis presented indicates that the SGA can now be executed in computationally efficient fashion, which was not possible before introducing the parallel implementation described in this letter.","doi":"10.1109/LGRS.2016.2635585","publicationTitle":"IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/8859/7862865/07822907.pdf","startPage":"304","endPage":"308","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LGRS.2016.2635585","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7862865","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance-Power Evaluation of an OpenCL Implementation of the Simplex Growing Algorithm for Hyperspectral Unmixing","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 January 2017","displayDocTitle":"Performance-Power Evaluation of an OpenCL Implementation of the Simplex Growing Algorithm for Hyperspectral Unmixing","volume":"14","issue":"3","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","accessionNumber":"16708636","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7822907/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7822907/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2017","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"EU (FEDER) and the Spanish MINECO","grantNumber":"TIN2015-65277-R and TIN2012-32180"},{"fundingName":"Formaci\u00f3n Posdoctoral programme","grantNumber":"FPDI-2013-16280"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance-Power Evaluation of an OpenCL Implementation of the Simplex Growing Algorithm for Hyperspectral Unmixing","sourcePdf":"lgrs-bernabegarcia-2635585-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.079558S","chronDate":"March  2017","xplore-pub-id":"8859","isNumber":"7862865","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8859","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7862865","articleId":"7822907","onlineDate":"18 January 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Letter","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7822911,"authors":[{"name":"Erhu Chen","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Information Technology, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Erhu","lastName":"Chen","orcid":"0000-0002-1017-7964","id":"37086121689"},{"name":"Minghua Xia","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Information Technology, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Minghua","lastName":"Xia","orcid":"0000-0002-0820-2227","id":"37627903000"},{"name":"Daniel B. da Costa","affiliation":["Department of Computer Engineering, Federal University of Cear\u00e1, Sobral, CE, Brazil"],"firstName":"Daniel B.","lastName":"da Costa","id":"37541972000"},{"name":"Sonia A\u00efssa","affiliation":["INRS-EMT, University of Quebec, Montreal, QC, Canada"],"firstName":"Sonia","lastName":"A\u00efssa","id":"37273216100"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-7798"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2558"},{"format":"CD","value":"2373-7891"}],"articleNumber":"7822911","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":34,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":865},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Energy harvesting","Relays","Signal to noise ratio","Interference","Fading channels","Data communication","Manganese"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Co-channel interference (CCI)","energy harvesting","multi-hop relaying","outage probability"]}],"abstract":"A novel multi-hop cooperative relaying transmission is proposed, where neither the source nor the relays have constant power supplies but rather scavenge energy from cochannel interferences (CCIs) and then use it for subsequent data transmission.

These systems can present serious problems related to the global clock. In this context, the asynchronous paradigm shows interesting features that fit as an alternative for the design, despite of the difficulties of the application of asynchronous logic. An interesting architecture for the Asynchronous Finite State Machines (AFSM) is based on local clock, because it reduces the requirements of asynchronous logic. This manuscript proposes a novel architecture of local clock for AFSMs, which is described by a popular specification known as Extended Burst-Mode (XBM). This architecture presents a better latency time when compared with other local clock architectures. Furthermore, the manuscript proposes a \u201cnecessary and sufficient\u201d condition for local clock AFSMs to be synthesized completely on the proposed architecture by using only conventional tools. Through a case study, we present the architecture, its robustness, the synthesis procedure and a comparison with other local clock architectures, highlighting its advantages.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7822920/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 January 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2017","volume":"64","issue":"5","accessionNumber":"16823921","dateOfInsertion":"24 April 2017","publicationDate":"May 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7822920/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Implementation of Locally-Clocked XBM State Machines on FPGAs Using Synchronous CAD Tools","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Implementation of Locally-Clocked XBM State Machines on FPGAs Using Synchronous CAD Tools","sourcePdf":"tcsi-faria-2649102-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.104484S","chronDate":"May  2017","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"7907349","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"7907349","articleId":"7822920","onlineDate":"18 January 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7822923,"authors":[{"name":"Masahito Morimoto","affiliation":["Telecommunications & Energy Laboratories, Ichihara, Japan"],"firstName":"Masahito","lastName":"Morimoto","orcid":"0000-0003-1685-1320","id":"37394375300"},{"name":"Haruki Ogoshi","affiliation":["Telecommunications & Energy Laboratories, Ichihara, Japan"],"firstName":"Haruki","lastName":"Ogoshi","id":"37371405400"},{"name":"Junji Yoshida","affiliation":["Telecommunications & Energy Laboratories and FITEL Products Division, Furukawa Electric Co., Ltd., Ichihara, Japan"],"firstName":"Junji","lastName":"Yoshida","id":"37340536300"},{"name":"Shigehiro Takasaka","affiliation":["Telecommunications & Energy Laboratories, Ichihara, Japan"],"firstName":"Shigehiro","lastName":"Takasaka","id":"37278061800"},{"name":"Akihide Sano","affiliation":["NTT Network Innovation Laboratories, NTT Corporation, Yokosuka, Japan"],"firstName":"Akihide","lastName":"Sano","id":"37308518800"},{"name":"Yutaka Miyamoto","affiliation":["NTT Network Innovation Laboratories, NTT Corporation, Yokosuka, Japan"],"firstName":"Yutaka","lastName":"Miyamoto","id":"37276190600"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1041-1135"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0174"}],"articleNumber":"7822923","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":19,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":537},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Photonics Society","url":"http://www.PhotonicsSociety.org"}],"abstract":"We propose a distributed Raman amplifier available for dual-order co-propagating configuration with low-relative intensity noise (RIN) transfer.

In the SC paradigm, logical computation is performed on randomized bit streams. In prior work, streams were generated with linear feedback shift registers; these contributed heavily to the hardware cost and consumed a significant amount of power. This paper introduces a new approach for encoding signal values: computation is performed on analog periodic pulse signals. Exploiting pulse width modulation, time-encoded signals corresponding to specific values are generated by adjusting the frequency and duty cycles of pulse width modulated (PWM) signals. With this approach, the latency, area, and energy consumption are all greatly reduced. Experimental results on image processing applications show up to 99% performance speedup, 98% saving in energy dissipation, and 40% area reduction compared to prior stochastic approaches. Circuits synthesized with the proposed approach can work as fast and energy-efficiently as a conventional binary design while retaining the fault-tolerance and low-cost advantages of conventional stochastic designs.","doi":"10.1109/TVLSI.2016.2645902","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7909068","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVLSI.2016.2645902","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions

The accuracy of the proposed model is verified by comparing the calculated transfer function of LC-dominant off-chip and RC-dominant on-chip examples against SPICE simulation results. In these verifications, the maximum errors between calculation and simulation are, respectively, 2.58% and 3.32% for off-chip and on-chip examples. The computation time is also reduced about 29.76 and 289.07 times compared with a single-channel model and the SPICE w-element model.

Specifically, we show that the distribution of the squared norm of a non-circular complex Gaussian random variable, usually referred to as the squared Hoyt distribution, can be constructed from a conditional exponential distribution. From this fundamental connection we introduce a new approach, the Hoyt transform method, that allows to analyze the performance of a wireless link under Hoyt (Nakagami-q) fading in a very simple way. We illustrate that many performance metrics for Hoyt fading can be calculated by leveraging well-known results for Rayleigh fading and only performing a finite-range integral. We use this technique to obtain novel results for some information and communication-theoretic metrics in Hoyt fading channels.","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2017.2655342","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel7/18/7855839/07822932.pdf","startPage":"1693","endPage":"1702","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2017.2655342","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7855839","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A New Framework for the Performance Analysis of Wireless Communications Under Hoyt (Nakagami- $q$ ) Fading","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7822932","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 January 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7822932/","displayDocTitle":"A New Framework for the Performance Analysis of Wireless Communications Under Hoyt (Nakagami- $q$ ) Fading","volume":"63","issue":"3","publicationDate":"March 2017","accessionNumber":"16669090","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7822932/","dateOfInsertion":"14 February 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Spanish Government-FEDER public Project","grantNumber":"TEC2013-42711-R"},{"fundingName":"Junta de Andalucia","grantNumber":"P11-TIC-7109"},{"fundingName":"Spanish Government-FEDER","grantNumber":"TEC2013-44442-P and COFUND2013-40259"},{"fundingName":"University of Malaga"},{"fundingName":"European Union under Marie-Curie COFUND U-mobility Program","grantNumber":"246550"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A New Framework for the Performance Analysis of Wireless Communications Under Hoyt (Nakagami- $q$ ) Fading","sourcePdf":"tit-romerojerez-2655342-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.093276S","chronDate":"March  2017","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"7855839","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"7855839","articleId":"7822932","onlineDate":"18 January 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7822934,"authors":[{"name":"Huyen Pham Thi","affiliation":["Department of Information and Communication Engineering, Inha University, Incheon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Huyen Pham","lastName":"Thi","id":"37085376368"},{"name":"Hanho Lee","affiliation":["Department of Information and Communication Engineering, Inha University, Incheon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Hanho","lastName":"Lee","orcid":"0000-0001-8815-1927","id":"37280126500"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-8210"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9999"}],"articleNumber":"7822934","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":11,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":546},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Circuits and Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieee-cas.org/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computer Society","url":"http://www.computer.org/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Solid-State Circuits Society","url":"http://www.sscs.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Decoding","Complexity theory","Computer architecture","Throughput","Reliability","Very large scale integration","Approximation algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS integrated circuits","Galois fields","minimax techniques","parity check codes","trellis codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["trellis min-max decoder architecture","nonbinary LDPC codes","nonbinary low-density parity-check codes","NB-LDPC","hardware complexity","CMOS","Galois-field","size 90 nm","bit rate 1.27 Gbit/s"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Check node processing","layered decoding","nonbinary LDPC","trellis min\u2013max (TMM)","VLSI design"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7822934","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/92/7909068/07822934.pdf","startPage":"1787","endPage":"1791","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVLSI.2017.2647985","doi":"10.1109/TVLSI.2017.2647985","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7909068","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Two-Extra-Column Trellis Min\u2013Max Decoder Architecture for Nonbinary LDPC Codes","abstract":"In this brief, a novel two-extra-column trellis min-max algorithm and the decoder architecture based on only the first minimum values are proposed for nonbinary low-density parity-check (NB-LDPC) codes.

We present a structure based on the elements of a group ring for constructing QC-LDPC codes. Some of the previously addressed methods for constructing QC-LDPC codes based on finite fields are special cases of the proposed construction method. The constructed QC-LDPC codes perform very well over the additive white Gaussian noise channel with iterative decoding in terms of bit-error probability and block-error probability. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed codes have competitive performance in comparison with the similar existing LDPC codes. Finally, we propose a new encoding method for the proposed group ring-based QC-LDPC codes that can be implemented faster than the current encoding methods. The encoding complexity of the proposed method is analyzed mathematically, and indicates a significate reduction in the required number of operations, even when compared to the available efficient encoding methods that have linear time and space complexities.","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2017.2655029","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2017.2655029","startPage":"2039","endPage":"2060","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel7/18/7879182/07822940.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7879182","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Construction and Encoding of QC-LDPC Codes Using Group Rings","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7822940/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 January 2017","displayDocTitle":"Construction and Encoding of QC-LDPC Codes Using Group Rings","volume":"63","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"15 March 2017","accessionNumber":"16743377","publicationDate":"April 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7822940/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100006115","fundingName":"Institute for Research in Fundamental Sciences"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100006115","fundingName":"Institute for Research in Fundamental Sciences","grantNumber":"95050116"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Construction and Encoding of QC-LDPC Codes Using Group Rings","sourcePdf":"tit-kiani-2655029-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.211499S","chronDate":"April  2017","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"7879182","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"7879182","articleId":"7822940","onlineDate":"18 January 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7822952,"authors":[{"name":"Yao Wang","affiliation":["Electrical, Computer and Energy Engineering Department, University of Colorado Boulder, Boulder, CO, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Yao Wang received his B.S. and M.S. degrees from the Department of Electronic Engineering at Tsinghua University, Beijing, China in 2009 and 2012 respectively.

An outer bound on the general nine-message 2 \u00d7 2 interference network is obtained and it is shown to be tight, thereby establishing the DoF region for the most general antenna setting wherein the four nodes have an arbitrary number of antennas each. The DoF-optimal scheme is applicable to the MIMO 2 \u00d7 2 interference network with constant channel coefficients, and hence, a fortiori, to time/frequency varying channel scenarios. In particular, a linear precoding scheme is proposed that can achieve all the DoF tuples in the DoF region. In it, the precise roles played by transmit zero-forcing, interference alignment, random beamforming, symbol extensions, and asymmetric complex signaling (ACS) are delineated. For instance, we identify a class of antenna settings, in which ACS is required to achieve the fractional-valued corner points. Evidently, the DoF regions of all previously unknown cases of the 2 \u00d7 2 interference network with a subset of the nine-messages are newly established as special cases of the general result of this paper. For instance, the DoF region of the well-known four-message (and even three-message) MIMO X channel is newly established. This problem had remained open despite previous studies, which had found inner and outer bounds that were not tight in general. Hence, the DoF regions of all special cases obtained from the general DoF region of the nine-message 2 \u00d7 2 interference network of this paper that include at least three of the four X channel messages are new, among many others. This paper sheds light on how the same physical 2 \u00d7 2 interference network could be used by a suitable choice of message sets to take most advantage of the channel resource in a flexible and efficient manner.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel7/18/7905784/07822952.pdf","startPage":"3259","endPage":"3276","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2017.2655341","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2017.2655341","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7905784","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7822952","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Degrees of Freedom Region of the MIMO $2 \\times 2$ Interference Network With General Message Sets","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Transmitters","MIMO","Interference channels","Receiving antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","array signal processing","linear codes","MIMO communication","precoding","radio receivers","radio transmitters","radiofrequency interference","time-frequency analysis","time-varying channels","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO 2x2 interference network","degrees of freedom region","general message set","DoF region","multiple input multiple output two-transmitter-two-receiver interference network","outer bound","general nine-message 2x2 interference network","general antenna setting","DoF-optimal scheme","constant channel coefficient","time-frequency varying channel scenario","linear precoding scheme","transmit zero-forcing","interference alignment","random beamforming","symbol extensions","asymmetric complex signaling","ACS","fractional-valued corner point","MIMO X channel","channel resource"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Beamforming","degrees of freedom","interference network","MIMO","general message sets","interference alignment","asymmetric complex signaling"]}],"chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/18/7905784/7822952-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7822952/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 January 2017","displayDocTitle":"Degrees of Freedom Region of the MIMO $2 \\times 2$ Interference Network With General Message Sets","volume":"63","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/7822952/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May 2017","accessionNumber":"16823367","dateOfInsertion":"24 April 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"NSF","grantNumber":"1423657"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","chorusFlag":"true","title":"Degrees of Freedom Region of the MIMO $2 \\times 2$ Interference Network With General Message Sets","sourcePdf":"tit-varanasi-2655341-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.112664S","chronDate":"May  2017","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"7905784","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","xplore-issue":"7905784","articleId":"7822952","onlineDate":"18 January 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7822955,"authors":[{"name":"Oscar Delgado","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, McGill University, Montreal, QC, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/8008868/7822955/delga-2655011-small.gif","p":["Oscar Delgado (M\u201910) received the M.A.Sc. degree in electrical\n engineering from Concordia University, Montreal, QC, Canada, in 2010, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering\n from McGill University, Montreal, QC, Canada, in 2016.","His industrial experience includes a network engineering position with the R&D Department, Telefonica, Lima,\n Peru.

This ability helps to increase the average mobile device data rate and to improve the network reliability. Load balancing among multiple paths become a key factor to avoid network congestion, nevertheless it requires efficient techniques to split traffic without adding more delay or generating too much packet reordering for delay-sensitive traffic. In this paper, we address two key issues in the context of uplink wireless mobile networks: 1) how to accurately split traffic among multiple paths and 2) how to minimize the end-to-end delay without increasing packet reordering. We propose delay-aware load balancing algorithm (DALBA), a novel strategy that splits traffic at the granularity of the packet. DALBA aims to minimize the splitting error (SE) and the end-to-end delay difference by effectively using all of the available paths. We analyze DALBA's performance through extensive simulations using H.264 video traffic. Numerical results demonstrate that DALBA outperforms previous algorithms in terms of SE, end-to-end delay and peak signal-to-noise ratio while keeping packet reordering to a suitable low value.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2017.2655011","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/25/8008868/07822955.pdf","startPage":"7485","endPage":"7494","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2017.2655011","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8008868","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Delay-Aware Load Balancing Over Multipath Wireless Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 January 2017","displayDocTitle":"Delay-Aware Load Balancing Over Multipath Wireless Networks","volume":"66","issue":"8","dateOfInsertion":"11 August 2017","accessionNumber":"17135894","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7822955/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7822955/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2017","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Delay-Aware Load Balancing Over Multipath Wireless Networks","sourcePdf":"tvt-delgadocollao-2655011-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.093434S","chronDate":"Aug.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"8008868","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"8008868","articleId":"7822955","onlineDate":"18 January 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7822959,"authors":[{"name":"Daniel Castanheira","affiliation":["Instituto de Telecomunica\u00e7\u00f5es and the Departamento de Electr\u00f3nica, University of Aveiro, Aveiro, Portugal"],"bio":{"p":["Daniel Castanheira received the Licenciatura (five years course) and Ph.D. degrees in Electronics and Telecommunications from the University of Aveiro in 2007 and 2012, respectively.

Our main contribution is to show that even with delayed CSIT and distributed transmitters, the achievable degrees of freedom (DoFs) still scale with the number of users. More specifically, we propose a method that achieves K/(2\u221aK -1) \u2265 \u221aK/2 DoF. The main idea behind the proposed method is to use interference alignment (IA) at the receiver side in conjunction with repetition coding at the transmitters. Repetition coding repeats the data R times while IA makes the interference generated by a given transmitter identical: 1) at all non-intended receivers and 2) all transmission repetitions. Therefore, one retransmission per transmitter is sufficient to cancel all the interference. This reduces significantly the overhead required for interference removal since the number of interference terms is reduced from RK(K - 1) to K.","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2017.2655343","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel7/18/7855839/07822959.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2017.2655343","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7855839","startPage":"1721","endPage":"1730","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Retrospective Interference Alignment: Degrees of Freedom Scaling With Distributed Transmitters","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7822959","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Retrospective Interference Alignment: Degrees of Freedom Scaling With Distributed Transmitters","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7822959/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 January 2017","isJournal":true,"volume":"63","issue":"3","publicationDate":"March 2017","accessionNumber":"16669116","dateOfInsertion":"14 February 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7822959/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001871","fundingName":"National Funds through FCT-Funda\u00e7\u00e3o para a Ci\u00eancia e a Tecnologia through the Project PURE-5GNET","grantNumber":"UID/EEA/50008/2013"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001871","fundingName":"FCT through the Postdoctoral","grantNumber":"SFRH/BPD/95375/2013"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Retrospective Interference Alignment: Degrees of Freedom Scaling With Distributed Transmitters","sourcePdf":"tit-castanheira-2655343-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.073059S","chronDate":"March  2017","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"7855839","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"7855839","articleId":"7822959","onlineDate":"18 January 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7822965,"authors":[{"name":"Yu-Min Lee","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/92/7909068/7822965/lee-2645230-small.gif","p":["Yu-Min Lee (M\u201903) received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in communication engineering from the National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan, in 1991 and 1993, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical and computer engineering from the University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, WI, USA, in 2003.","He has been with the National Chiao Tung University, since 2003, where he is currently an Associate Professor with the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering.

This paper develops a 3-D partitioning-based force-directed placer, NaPer, to reduce the total coupling noise between TSVs and alleviate the maximum coupling noise between them. We introduce two denoise forces: TSV decoupling force and TSV density force. The TSV decoupling force is determined by the coupling noise between TSVs for separating strong coupling TSVs, and the TSV density force is determined by the TSV density for evenly distributing TSVs. The experimental results show that NaPer can effectively reduce 15.0% total TSV coupling noise and 42.7% maximum TSV coupling noise on average with only 4.5% wirelength overhead. Besides, NaPer also shows great performance in wirelength that is competitive to the state-of-the-art 3-D placer.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7822965/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 January 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2017","volume":"25","issue":"5","accessionNumber":"16838415","dateOfInsertion":"24 April 2017","publicationDate":"May 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7822965/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"NaPer: A TSV Noise-Aware Placer","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004663","fundingName":"Ministry of Science and Technology of Taiwan","grantNumber":"MOST 103-2221-E-009-209 and MOST 105-2221-E-009-168"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"NaPer: A TSV Noise-Aware Placer","sourcePdf":"tvlsi-lee-2645230-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.140031S","chronDate":"May  2017","xplore-pub-id":"92","isNumber":"7909068","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7909068","articleId":"7822965","onlineDate":"18 January 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7822966,"authors":[{"name":"Chulong Liang","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, City University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong"],"firstName":"Chulong","lastName":"Liang","orcid":"0000-0003-1503-8063","id":"38022395800"},{"name":"Junjie Ma","affiliation":["Department of Statistics, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA","Department of Electronic Engineering, City University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong"],"firstName":"Junjie","lastName":"Ma","orcid":"0000-0003-1503-8063","id":"37716883800"},{"name":"Li Ping","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, City University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong"],"firstName":"Li","lastName":"Ping","id":"37279033100"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-7798"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2558"},{"format":"CD","value":"2373-7891"}],"articleNumber":"7822966","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":477},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Error correction codes","Encoding","Modulation","Message passing","Decoding","Forward error correction"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Approximate message passing (AMP)","compressed sensing","concatenated codes","Hadamard codes","message passing decoding","sparse-regression (SR) codes","spatial coupling (SC)","turbo codes"]}],"abstract":"An error floor problem is observed for a spatially coupled sparse-regression (SCSR) code with limited sparsity in low-to-medium rates.

An advanced multidomain multitechnology testbed is implemented, which consists of a 400-Gb/s variable capacity optical packet switching domain and a Tb/s-class flexi-grid wavelength division multiplexed optical circuit switching domain. The SDN-controllable transponders and the extended transport applications programming interface enable the congestion-aware provisioning of end-to-end real-time services. At the data plane level, different transponders based on orthogonal frequency division multiplexing are employed for inter/intradomain links in order to adaptively provision services with fine granularity. For adaptation, SDN-capable domain-specific optical performance monitors are also introduced. In the control plane, the applications based network operations architecture has been extended and addressed as an adaptive SDN orchestrator.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Demonstration of Adaptive SDN Orchestration: A Real-Time Congestion-Aware Services Provisioning Over OFDM-Based 400G OPS and Flexi-WDM OCS","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","doi":"10.1109/JLT.2017.2655418","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/50/7869456/07822967.pdf","startPage":"506","endPage":"512","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JLT.2017.2655418","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7869456","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7822967","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7822967/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 January 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.1, 1 2017","displayDocTitle":"Demonstration of Adaptive SDN Orchestration: A Real-Time Congestion-Aware Services Provisioning Over OFDM-Based 400G OPS and Flexi-WDM OCS","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"35","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/7822967/","dateOfInsertion":"03 March 2017","publicationDate":"1 Feb.1, 2017","accessionNumber":"16721626","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004963","fundingName":"FP7","grantNumber":"GA 608528, 2014\u20132016"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003329","fundingName":"MINECO","grantNumber":"TEC2015-69256-R (DESTELLO)"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Demonstration of Adaptive SDN Orchestration: A Real-Time Congestion-Aware Services Provisioning Over OFDM-Based 400G OPS and Flexi-WDM OCS","sourcePdf":"jlt-fabrega-2655418-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.126783S","chronDate":"Feb.1, 1 2017","xplore-pub-id":"50","isNumber":"7869456","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"7869456","articleId":"7822967","onlineDate":"18 January 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7822969,"authors":[{"name":"Christopher Rose","affiliation":["Brown University, Providence, RI, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6687308/7858816/7822969/rose-2655026-small.gif","p":["Christopher Rose (S\u201978\u2013M\u201986\u2013SM\u201905\u2013F\u201907) received the Ph.D. degree in EECS from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, in 1985.

Inscribed matter is defined as an ensemble of \u201ctokens\u201d (biotic/abiotic objects) and is inspired, at least partially, by biological systems where groups of individually constructed discrete particles ranging from molecules to viruses and organisms are released by a source and travel to a target\u2014for example, morphogens or semiochemicals diffuse from one cell, tissue, or organism to another. For identical-tokens that are neither lost nor modified, we consider messages encoded using three candidate communication schemes: 1) token timing (timed release); 2) token payload (composition); and 3) token timing plus payload. We provide capacity bounds for each scheme and discuss their relative utility. We find that under not unreasonable assumptions, megabit per second rates could be supported at 100 femtoWatt transmitter powers. Since quantities such as token concentration or token counting are derivatives of token arrival timing, token timing undergirds all molecular communication techniques. Thus, our modeling and results about the physics of efficient token-based information transfer can inform investigations of diverse theoretical and practical problems in engineering and biology. This paper, Part I, focuses on the information theoretic bounds on capacity. Part II develops some of the mathematical and information theoretic machinery that support the bounds presented here.","doi":"10.1109/TMBMC.2017.2655025","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMBMC.2017.2655025","startPage":"209","endPage":"227","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Molecular, Biological and

as high data rate, license free, energy efficient, flexible access, and high degree of security. A hybrid optical wireless network based on FSO/VLC heterogeneous interconnection is presented here for future space-air-ground-ocean-integrated communication architecture, especially in the radio-frequency-sensitive (RF) or security-required environments. The functional modules of the hybrid network coordinator are defined, along with the implementation and deployment details. Three fundamental network-layer mechanisms are designed in the coordinator including user identification and localization, user mobility and handoff control, and routing and traffic management. An experimental platform is built to evaluate the transmission performance of the presented hybrid network, and a complete data aggregation/transmission/distribution procedure based on heterogeneous interconnection is first realized, which includes two-segment 1.0-m 450-Mb/s orthogonal-frequency-division-multiplexing-based VLC transmissions interconnected by one-segment 430-m 0.96-Gb/s on-off keying (OOK)-based nonturbulent FSO transmission, with the bit error rate under the forward-error-correction limit (3.8 \u00d7 10\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">-3</sup>\n ).

In addition, the Co-60 \u03b3 ray source provides global irradiation on the full chip of FRAM. The FRAM memory cell is proved to have a lower failure threshold for TID effect than the ferroelectric thin-film capacitor due to the performance degradation of nMOS transistor in memory cell.

This is a challenging problem because in addition to being robust under different imaging conditions such as varying viewpoints and illumination changes, the features should also be able to distinguish the specific product among many similar products. Consequently, it is important to utilize a large dataset, containing many product classes, to learn a strongly discriminative representation. Building such a dataset requires laborious manual annotation. Toward learning fine-grained, robust, discriminative features for product image search, we present a novel paradigm that can construct the required dataset without any human annotation. Unlike other fine-grained recognition works that rely on high-quality annotated datasets and are very narrowly focused on a specific object category, our method handles multiple object classes and requires minimum human effort. First, an ImageNet pretrained model is used to generate product clusters. As the original features from ImageNet are not discriminative, the clusters generated by this unsupervised procedure contain much noise. We alleviate noise by explicitly modeling noise distribution and automatically detecting errors during learning. The proposed paradigm is general, requires minimum human efforts, and is applicable to any deep learning task where fine-grained discriminative features are desired. Extensive experiments on the ALISC dataset have demonstrated that our approach is sound and effective, surpassing the baseline GoogleNet model by 15.09%.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7823008/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 January 2017","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"16885092","volume":"19","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/7823008/","publicationDate":"June 2017","dateOfInsertion":"15 May 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Matryoshka Peek: Toward Learning Fine-Grained, Robust, Discriminative Features for Product Search","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000964","fundingName":"National Research Foundation"},{"fundingName":"National Nature Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61525206, 61271428, 61572169 and 61472266"},{"fundingName":"International Exchange and Cooperation Foundation of Shenzhen City","grantNumber":"GJHZ20150312114149569"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001352","fundingName":"National University of Singapore (Suzhou) Research Institute"},{"fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Matryoshka Peek: Toward Learning Fine-Grained, Robust, Discriminative Features for Product Search","sourcePdf":"tmm-qi-2655422-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.115326S","chronDate":"June  2017","xplore-pub-id":"6046","isNumber":"7927810","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6046","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7927810","articleId":"7823008","onlineDate":"18 January 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":7823015,"authors":[{"name":"Mauro Mangia","affiliation":["DEI and ARCES, University of Bologna, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8919/7907349/7823015/mangi-2649572-small.gif","p":["Mauro Mangia (S\u201909\u2013M\u201913) received the Ph.D. degree in information technology from the University of Bologna, Italy, in 2013.

We exploit CS as a simple early-digital compression stage that performs a multiplication of the signal by a matrix. The operating costs (e.g., the consumed power) of such an encoding stage depend on the number of rows of the matrix, but also on the value and position of the rows' coefficients. Our novel design flow yields optimized sparse matrices with very few rows. It is a non-trivial extension of the rakeness-based approach to CS and yields an extremely lightweight stage implemented by a very small number of possibly signed sums with an excellent compression performance. By means of a general signal model we explore different corners of the design space and show that, for example, our method is capable of compressing the signal by a factor larger than 2.5 while not considering 30% of the original samples (so that they may not be acquired at all, leaving the analog front-end and ADC stages inactive) and by processing each of the considered samples with not more than three signed sums.","doi":"10.1109/TCSI.2017.2649572","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7907349","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSI.2017.2649572","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","pdfPath":"/iel7/8919/7907349/07823015.pdf","startPage":"1201","endPage":"1213","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Rakeness-Based Design of Low-Complexity Compressed Sensing","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 January 2017","displayDocTitle":"Rakeness-Based Design of Low-Complexity Compressed Sensing","volume":"64","issue":"5","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2017","dateOfInsertion":"24 April 2017","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7823015/","publicationDate":"May 2017","accessionNumber":"16823925","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7823015/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Rakeness-Based Design of Low-Complexity Compressed Sensing","sourcePdf":"tcsi-pareschi-2649572-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.13558S","chronDate":"May  2017","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"7907349","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"37","xplore-issue":"7907349","articleId":"7823015","onlineDate":"18 January 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7823016,"authors":[{"name":"Wen-Tai Li","affiliation":["Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD), Singapore"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6245516/8824015/7823016/li-2655362-small.gif","p":["WEN-TAI LI (S'12) received the BS and MS degrees in optoelectronics and communication engineering from National Kaohsiung Normal University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan, in 2009 and 2011, respectively.

The latter can be interpreted as hybrid dynamical systems involving discontinuity boundaries and switching in the vector field. Discontinuity mapping is used to define an accurate high order model to propagate perturbations at discontinuity boundaries. This novel approach is more efficient than computing power spectral density of large-signal waveforms from long lasting time domain simulations. Furthermore, with respect to established macro-modeling techniques, it provides a better understanding of how electric elements influence the noise performance. The inherent features of the circuit components turn out to be directly embedded both in the system fundamental matrix and in the discontinuity mapping involved in its dynamical evolution. The validity of the approach is verified through numerical simulations.","doi":"10.1109/TCSI.2016.2645638","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSI.2016.2645638","startPage":"1494","endPage":"1503","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","pdfPath":"/iel7/8919/7934110/07823017.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7934110","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient and Reliable Small-Signal Estimate of Quantization Noise Contribution to Phase Noise in $\\Delta \\Sigma $ Fractional- $N$ PLL","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7823017/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 January 2017","displayDocTitle":"Efficient and Reliable Small-Signal Estimate of Quantization Noise Contribution to Phase Noise in $\\Delta \\Sigma $ Fractional- $N$ PLL","volume":"64","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"25 May 2017","accessionNumber":"16918026","publicationDate":"June 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7823017/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient and Reliable Small-Signal Estimate of Quantization Noise Contribution to Phase Noise in $\\Delta \\Sigma $ Fractional- $N$ PLL","sourcePdf":"tcsi-bizzarri-2645638-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.124546S","chronDate":"June  2017","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"7934110","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"7934110","articleId":"7823017","onlineDate":"18 January 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7823023,"authors":[{"name":"Cyril Jouanlanne","affiliation":["CEA-LETI, Grenoble, France"],"firstName":"Cyril","lastName":"Jouanlanne","id":"37085566491"},{"name":"Antonio Clemente","affiliation":["CEA-LETI, Grenoble, France"],"firstName":"Antonio","lastName":"Clemente","orcid":"0000-0003-4623-952X","id":"38181374900"},{"name":"Mathieu Huchard","affiliation":["Radiall, Voreppe, France"],"firstName":"Mathieu","lastName":"Huchard","id":"37079282800"},{"name":"Julien Keignart","affiliation":["CEA-LETI, Grenoble, France"],"firstName":"Julien","lastName":"Keignart","id":"37298905500"},{"name":"Cyril Barbier","affiliation":["Radiall, Voreppe, France"],"firstName":"Cyril","lastName":"Barbier","id":"37086190763"},{"name":"Thierry Le Nadan","affiliation":["Radiall, Voreppe, France"],"firstName":"Thierry","lastName":"Le Nadan","id":"37086190732"},{"name":"Laurent Petit","affiliation":["Radiall, Voreppe, France"],"firstName":"Laurent","lastName":"Petit","id":"38051989300"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-926X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2221"}],"articleNumber":"7823023","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":55,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":2677},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society","url":"http://www.ieeeaps.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Broadband antennas","Transmitting antennas","Computer architecture","Wideband","Apertures","Lenses","Antenna arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna radiation patterns","broadband antennas","linear antenna arrays","planar antenna arrays","printed circuits","radomes","transmitting antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wideband linearly polarized transmitarray antenna","backhauling applications","planar circular-shape array","three-metal layer standard printed circuit board","ad hoc focal source","radome layer","phase resolution","in-house CAD tool","electromagnetic simulations","frequency 57 GHz to 66 GHz"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Backhauling","discrete lens","fifth-generation (5G)","flat lens","millimeter wave (mmWave)","point-to-point communications","transmitarray antenna"]}],"abstract":"This communication presents the design of a linearly polarized transmitarray antenna for backhauling applications at V-band (57-66 GHz).

In long-term evolution, establishing a connection requires a relatively complex handshaking procedure. Such an approach is suitable for a system serving only a few high-activity users, but it becomes cumbersome for MTC traffic, where large amounts of low-activity users intermittently transmit a small number of packets. We propose a random access channel (RACH)-based scheme for the future 5G system that allows MTC users to send small packets within the random access burst. Device activity detection, channel estimation, authentication, and data decoding are performed simultaneously from the same access burst. In addition to the inherent reduction in energy consumption, the scheme eliminates the signaling overhead and creates more resources for data transmission. We have constructed an analytical framework for the detection performance of a multiple-input-multiple-output receiver in a frequency-selective channel. This has been validated with simulations, and results show that a one-shot correlate-and-cancel algorithm is sufficient for activity detection and channel estimation when the base station either employs multiple receive antennas or schedules multiple resource blocks for MTC RACH.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7823034/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 January 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2017","volume":"16","issue":"3","accessionNumber":"16725109","dateOfInsertion":"08 March 2017","publicationDate":"March 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7823034/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Random Access Scheme for Sporadic Users in 5G","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Aalto ELEC Doctoral School"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004181","fundingName":"Nokia Foundation"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Random Access Scheme for Sporadic Users in 5G","sourcePdf":"twc-beyene-2655044-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.089902S","chronDate":"March  2017","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"7874223","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"29","xplore-issue":"7874223","articleId":"7823034","onlineDate":"18 January 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7823092,"authors":[{"name":"Kyriakos G.

This paper is focusing on implementation of multiplier which works on runtime data with lower supply and clock frequency. Multipliers plays important role in arithmetic operations and it is power consuming part of circuit. This system is designed to address the issue of excess power consumption at lower workload. Dynamic system is developed for effective use of reconfigurable hardware and to address the power challenge. Range detection is the first step for making system dynamic once range is detected it generates control signal to frequency scaling unit, voltage scaling unit, and multiplication. In the Multiplication reversible gate as multiplier and Kogge-stone adder is used which results in efficient use of LUT's and delays as compared with previous scheme. To maintain performance trend in the age of runtime changing hardware configuration, it is beneficial to implement Multiprecision multiplier (MP) multiplier in modern XILINX as part of an FPGA. Experimental result shows that implementation of DVFS for multiplier block is on FPGA and it is offering good performance at low power supply voltage 3.3V to 1.25V and frequency 32MHz to 8MHz.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7823206/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-27 Aug. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"Aug. 2016","accessionNumber":"16616859","htmlLink":"/document/7823206/","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2017","conferenceDate":"26-27 Aug. 2016","isConference":true,"volume":"1","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"An efficient voltage and frequency division method for multiprecision multiplier on FPGA","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An efficient voltage and frequency division method for multiprecision multiplier on FPGA","confLoc":"Coimbatore, India","sourcePdf":"127.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052098S","chronDate":"26-27 Aug. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7811903","isNumber":"7823173","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7811903","xplore-issue":"7823173","articleId":"7823206","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7823234,"authors":[{"name":"Ajay Kumar","affiliation":["Dept. of Computer Science and Engineering, Thapar University, India"],"firstName":"Ajay","lastName":"Kumar","id":"37086087763"},{"name":"Nikita Tyagi","affiliation":["Dept. of Computer Science and Engineering, Thapar University, India"],"firstName":"Nikita","lastName":"Tyagi","id":"37086177171"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1285-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"DVD ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1283-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1286-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7823234","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":237},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Prediction algorithms","Artificial neural networks","Training","Neurons","Algorithm design and analysis","Predictive models","Testing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["backpropagation","geophysics computing","mean square error methods","radial basis function networks","rain","weather forecasting"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["natural hazards","climatic variations","back propagation","radial basis function neural network","rainfall forecasting","Coonoor region","Nilgiri district","Tamil Nadu","monthly rainfall prediction","mean square error","RBF neural network"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Back propagation Neural Network","Radial Basis Neural Network","Mean Square Error"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7823234","abstract":"Rainfall plays a major role in the economic growth of every country.

Cloud Computing is used to deliver computing Services over the internet and is used to store data in cloud servers. Due to the sharing of services, privacy and data security have become a major area of concern in cloud computing. The cloud service providers store and maintain client data across data centers which provides threats of data leaks. It is found that several mechanisms have emphasized on data security and in the ensuing process have ignored privacy. Authentication helps to ensure and confirms a user's identity. The existing traditional password authentication does not provide enough security for the data residing in cloud and there have been instances when the password based authentication has been manipulated to gain access into the cloud data. Multifactor authentication is a methodology that uses two or more authentication techniques along with the password but it still does not provide fool-proof data security. Since the conventional methods such as passwords do not serve the purpose of data security, research works focused on biometric traits were as a means of user authentication in cloud services. The biometric authentication is broadly classified into physical based biometric authentication and behavioral based biometric authentication. This paper presents an overview of those methods and analyzes their merits and demerits. The study has been structured to analyze the prevailing biometric authentication mechanisms to gain insights in developing a new authentication model that is more efficient than the existing methods.","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 International Conference on Inventive Computation Technologies (ICICT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7811903/7823173/07823273.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","publicationTitle":"2016 International Conference on Inventive Computation Technologies (ICICT)","doi":"10.1109/INVENTIVE.2016.7823273","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INVENTIVE.2016.7823273","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7823173","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7823273","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A survey on biometric based authentication in cloud computing","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Authentication","Cloud computing","Iris recognition","Thumb","Privacy","Data security"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biometrics (access control)","cloud computing","computer centres","data privacy","security of data"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","biometric based authentication","Internet","data security","data privacy","cloud service providers","client data storage","data centers","physical based biometric authentication","behavioral based biometric authentication"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Authentication","Privacy","Multifactor","Identity","security"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7823273/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-27 Aug. 2016","displayDocTitle":"A survey on biometric based authentication in cloud computing","isConference":true,"volume":"1","htmlLink":"/document/7823273/","publicationDate":"Aug. 2016","accessionNumber":"16616816","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2017","conferenceDate":"26-27 Aug. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A survey on biometric based authentication in cloud computing","confLoc":"Coimbatore, India","sourcePdf":"75.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068568S","chronDate":"26-27 Aug. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7811903","isNumber":"7823173","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7811903","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"7823173","articleId":"7823273","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7823292,"authors":[{"name":"G.

PSO is a population-based optimization algorithm modeled after the simulation of social behavior of swarms to find near-optimal solutions.

The K-means clustering algorithm is then applied on each particle to refine the chosen centroids at user specified probability. Each pixel is assigned to the cluster with the closest centroid. Next the Gaussian PSO is applied to update the centroids obtained using the K-means clustering. For performance analysis the proposed algorithm is tested on standard images in the literature and experimental result shows that the Gaussian PSO based quantization method improves image quality significantly compared to conventional PSO based approach.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Color image quantization using Gaussian Particle Swarm Optimization(CIQ-GPSO)","publicationTitle":"2016 International Conference on Inventive Computation Technologies (ICICT)","doi":"10.1109/INVENTIVE.2016.7823295","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 International Conference on Inventive Computation Technologies (ICICT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7811903/7823173/07823295.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INVENTIVE.2016.7823295","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7823173","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7823295","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7823295/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-27 Aug. 2016","displayDocTitle":"Color image quantization using Gaussian Particle Swarm Optimization(CIQ-GPSO)","conferenceDate":"26-27 Aug. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"1","htmlLink":"/document/7823295/","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2017","publicationDate":"Aug. 2016","accessionNumber":"16616795","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Color image quantization using Gaussian Particle Swarm Optimization(CIQ-GPSO)","confLoc":"Coimbatore, India","sourcePdf":"97.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059171S","chronDate":"26-27 Aug. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7811903","isNumber":"7823173","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7811903","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"7823173","articleId":"7823295","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7823333,"authors":[{"name":"Wenyun Dai","affiliation":["Pace University"],"bio":{"p":["Wenyun Dai is a Ph.D. student of computer science at Pace University.

Smartphones, as the typical pivot of IoT devices, use various kinds of apps, which collect our private data. In fact, private data leakage, as a potential hazard, is caused by the current design trend in industry, which is bigger and bigger. However, few people notice the side-effect, while we seem never bored by pursuing \u201csmart\u201d devices. In this article, we introduce the behaviors of data collection, and illustrate the motivations and reasons behind them. Thankfully, cloud computing with sufficient resources and exquisite services is a perfect way out. We introduce a mobile-cloud framework to provide fine-grained permission authorization service for IoT devices, and show its performance by experimental results. Nevertheless, there are still lots of issues to be solved for the perfect IoT-cloud architecture. We list and analyze some obstacles and trends in the field of IoT-cloud.","doi":"10.1109/MCOM.2017.1600349CM","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7823317","startPage":"20","endPage":"25","pdfPath":"/iel7/35/7823317/07823333.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Magazine","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Magazine","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MCOM.2017.1600349CM","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Who Moved My Data?

Next generation network architectures need to satisfy these two requirements while connecting IoT sources producing data at massive scales to cloud resources that provide the capability to process and store this data. For this reason, realization of IoT in next generation cellular networks faces the problem of delivering cloud services over the network to things that are placed anywhere. In this study, we explain how the technologies envisioned for next generation networks can respond to the challenge of realizing IoT over a use case prepared for the IoT smart home platform called IOLITE. We start by discussing capacity requirements and focus on network densification as a promising solution method. The challenges of network densification can be overcome by integrating the technological enablers such as SDN, C-RAN, SON, and mobile edge computing. For this reason, we provide a thorough survey on the state of the art in integrating these enablers for a flexible network architecture at all network segments. Finally, we discuss how the needs of the IOLITE community use case scenario can be satisfied by implementing a service- centric abstraction layer on top of a flexible infrastructure for beyond 5G IoT applications.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7823317","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MCOM.2017.1600372CM","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Magazine","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel7/35/7823317/07823336.pdf","startPage":"41","endPage":"47","doi":"10.1109/MCOM.2017.1600372CM","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Beyond 5G Vision for IOLITE Community","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"January  2017","displayDocTitle":"Beyond 5G Vision for IOLITE Community","volume":"55","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/7823336/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"January 2017","accessionNumber":"16598533","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2017","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7823336/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 January 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Beyond 5G Vision for IOLITE Community","sourcePdf":"014KHAN_LAYOUT.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.036925S","chronDate":"January  2017","xplore-pub-id":"35","isNumber":"7823317","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"35","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"7823317","articleId":"7823336","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":7823337,"authors":[{"name":"Jemal H.

However, existing works lack flexibility, scalability, and energy efficiency. This article presents a pervasive patient health monitoring (PPHM) system infrastructure. PPHM is based on integrated cloud computing and Internet of Things technologies. In order to demonstrate the suitability of the proposed PPHM infrastructure, a case study for real-time monitoring of a patient suffering from congestive heart failure using ECG is presented. Experimental evaluation of the proposed PPHM infrastructure shows that PPHM is a flexible, scalable, and energy-efficient remote patient health monitoring system.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7823337/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 January 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"January  2017","volume":"55","issue":"1","accessionNumber":"16598524","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2017","publicationDate":"January 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7823337/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Federated Internet of Things and Cloud Computing Pervasive Patient Health Monitoring System","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Federated Internet of Things and Cloud Computing Pervasive Patient Health Monitoring System","sourcePdf":"015ABAWAJY_LAYOUT.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.050559S","chronDate":"January  2017","xplore-pub-id":"35","isNumber":"7823317","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"35","citationCount":"131","xplore-issue":"7823317","articleId":"7823337","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-21"},{"_id":7823338,"authors":[{"name":"Min Chen","affiliation":["Huazhong University of Science and Technology"],"bio":{"p":["Min Chen [SM' (minchen@ieee.org) has been a full professor in the School of Computer Science and Technology at Huazhong University of Science and Technology (HUST) since February 2012.

Vehicular communication systems are indispensable components in autonomous vehicles to share road conditions in a wireless manner. With the exponential increase of traffic data, conventional wireless technologies preliminarily show their incompetence because of limited bandwidth. This article explores the capability of millimeter-wave communications for autonomous vehicles. As the next-generation wireless technology, mmWave is advanced in its multi-gigabit transmittability and beamforming technique. Based on these features, we propose the novel design of a vehicular mmWave system combining the advantages of the Internet of Things and cloud computing. This mmWave system supports vehicles sharing multi-gigabit data about the surrounding environment and recognizing objects via the cloud in real time. Therefore, autonomous vehicles are able to determine the optimal driving strategy instantaneously.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7823339/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 January 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"January  2017","volume":"55","issue":"1","accessionNumber":"16598542","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2017","publicationDate":"January 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7823339/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Millimeter-Wave Wireless Communications for IoT-Cloud Supported Autonomous Vehicles: Overview, Design, and Challenges","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Millimeter-Wave Wireless Communications for IoT-Cloud Supported Autonomous Vehicles: Overview, Design, and Challenges","sourcePdf":"017KONG_LAYOUT.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.038935S","chronDate":"January  2017","xplore-pub-id":"35","isNumber":"7823317","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"35","citationCount":"127","xplore-issue":"7823317","articleId":"7823339","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-26"},{"_id":7823340,"authors":[{"name":"Ghulam Muhammad","affiliation":["King Saud University"],"bio":{"p":["Ghulam Muhammad [M'10] (ghulam@ksu.edu.sa) is an associate professor in the Computer Engineering Department, College of Computer and Information Sciences (CCIS), King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.

The LTE/LTE-A technology is a major candidate for provisioning of MTC applications. However, due to the diverse characteristics of payload size, transmission periodicity, power efficiency, and QoS requirement, MTC poses huge challenges to LTE/LTE-A technologies. In particular, efficient management of massive random access is one of the most critical challenges. In the case of massive random access attempts, the probability of preamble collision drastically increases, and thus the performance of LTE/LTE-A random access degrades sharply. In this context, this article reviews the current state-of-the-art proposals to control massive random access of MTC devices in LTE/LTE-A networks. The proposals are compared in terms of five major metrics: access delay, access success rate, power efficiency, QoS guarantee, and the effect on HTC. To this end, we propose a novel collision resolution random access model for massive MTC over LTE/LTE-A. Our proposed model basically resolves the preamble collisions instead of avoidance and targets the management of massive and bursty access attempts. Simulations of our proposed model show huge improvements in random access success rate compared to the standard slotted-Aloha- based models. The new model can also coexist with existing LTE/LTE-A MAC protocol and ensure high reliability and time-efficient network access.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel7/35/7823317/07823342.pdf","startPage":"76","endPage":"83","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Magazine","doi":"10.1109/MCOM.2017.1600215CM","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MCOM.2017.1600215CM","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7823317","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7823342","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"LTE/LTE-A Random Access for Massive Machine-Type Communications in Smart Cities","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Long Term Evolution","Delays","Quality of service","Smart cities","Uplink","Time-frequency analysis","Mobile communication","Urban areas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["access protocols","Long Term Evolution","smart cities"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["LTE/LTE-A random access","massive machine-type communications","smart cities","cellular networks","MTC","LTE/LTE-A technology","wireless smart city applications","transmission periodicity","power efficiency","QoS requirement","LTE/LTE-A technologies","power efficiency","LTE/LTE-A MAC protocol"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7823342/","chronOrPublicationDate":"January  2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 January 2017","displayDocTitle":"LTE/LTE-A Random Access for Massive Machine-Type Communications in Smart Cities","volume":"55","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/7823342/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"January 2017","accessionNumber":"16598522","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"LTE/LTE-A Random Access for Massive Machine-Type Communications in Smart Cities","sourcePdf":"020HOSSAIN_LAYOUT.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.063187S","chronDate":"January  2017","xplore-pub-id":"35","isNumber":"7823317","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"35","citationCount":"100","xplore-issue":"7823317","articleId":"7823342","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7823343,"authors":[{"name":"Waleed Ejaz","affiliation":["Ryerson University"],"bio":{"p":["Waleed Ejaz [S'12, M'14, SM'14 SM'16] (waleed.ejaz@ieee.org) is a senior research associate in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Ryerson University, Toronto, Canada.

The Internet of Things offers many sophisticated and ubiquitous applications for smart cities. The energy demand of IoT applications is increased, while IoT devices continue to grow in both numbers and requirements. Therefore, smart city solutions must have the ability to efficiently utilize energy and handle the associated challenges. Energy management is considered as a key paradigm for the realization of complex energy systems in smart cities. In this article, we present a brief overview of energy management and challenges in smart cities. We then provide a unifying framework for energy-efficient optimization and scheduling of IoT-based smart cities. We also discuss the energy harvesting in smart cities, which is a promising solution for extending the lifetime of low-power devices and its related challenges. We detail two case studies. The first one targets energy-efficient scheduling in smart homes, and the second covers wireless power transfer for IoT devices in smart cities. Simulation results for the case studies demonstrate the tremendous impact of energy- efficient scheduling optimization and wireless power transfer on the performance of IoT in smart cities.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel7/35/7823317/07823343.pdf","startPage":"84","endPage":"91","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Magazine","doi":"10.1109/MCOM.2017.1600218CM","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MCOM.2017.1600218CM","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7823317","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7823343","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient Energy Management for the Internet of Things in Smart Cities","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Long Term Evolution","Mobile communication","Urban areas","Smart cities","Smart devices","Energy management","Internet of things"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["energy harvesting","Internet of Things","power aware computing","smart cities"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Internet of Things","smart cities","IoT applications","energy management","energy harvesting","energy-efficient scheduling","wireless power transfer"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7823343/","chronOrPublicationDate":"January  2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 January 2017","displayDocTitle":"Efficient Energy Management for the Internet of Things in Smart Cities","volume":"55","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/7823343/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"January 2017","accessionNumber":"16598520","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient Energy Management for the Internet of Things in Smart Cities","sourcePdf":"021JO_LAYOUT.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.06076S","chronDate":"January  2017","xplore-pub-id":"35","isNumber":"7823317","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"35","citationCount":"215","xplore-issue":"7823317","articleId":"7823343","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-13"},{"_id":7823347,"authors":[{"name":"Ibrar Yaqoob","affiliation":["Faculty of Computer Science and Information Technology, University of Malaya"],"bio":{"p":["Ibrar Yaqoob received his B.S.

A smart city can monitor the physical world in real time, and provide intelligent services to both local residents and travelers in terms of transportation, healthcare, environment, entertainment, and energy. However, security and privacy concerns arise, since smart city applications not only collect a wide range of privacy-sensitive information from people and their social circles, but also control city facilities and influence people's lives. In this article, we investigate security and privacy in smart city applications. Specifically, we first introduce promising smart city applications and architecture. Then we discuss several security and privacy challenges in these applications. Some research efforts are subsequently presented to address these security and privacy challenges for intelligent healthcare, transportation, and smart energy. Finally, we point out some open issues for future research.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7823349/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 January 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"January  2017","volume":"55","issue":"1","accessionNumber":"16598543","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2017","publicationDate":"January 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7823349/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Security and Privacy in Smart City Applications: Challenges and Solutions","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Security and Privacy in Smart City Applications: Challenges and Solutions","sourcePdf":"026ZHANG2_LAYOUT.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.080179S","chronDate":"January  2017","xplore-pub-id":"35","isNumber":"7823317","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"35","citationCount":"269","xplore-issue":"7823317","articleId":"7823349","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7823364,"authors":[{"name":"Murat Uysal","affiliation":["\u00d6zyegin University"],"bio":{"p":["Murat Uysal (murat.uysal@ozyegin.edu.tr) is a full professor at Ozyegin University, Istanbul, Turkey, where he leads the Communication Theory and Technologies (CT&T) Research Group.

Conventional online DGA equipment suffers from problems such as cross sensitivity, electromagnetic compatibility and reliability. Based on tunable diode laser absorption spectroscopy (TDLAS) technique, a novel optical method is proposed to detect dissolved methane in transformer oil. Oil samples with fault gases are prepared and dissolved methane detection has been carried out in the laboratory. 1653.72 nm is selected as the central wavelength of tunable diode laser, moreover, a multipass gas cell and wavelength modulation strategy is utilized to trace methane dissolved in oil. Results show that the resolution of detection reaches 0.28 \u03bcL/L, and accuracy is less than 2 \u03bcL/L at low concentration. In addition, the detection cycle is so time-saving, less than 5 minutes. The proposed measurement method shows tremendous advantages, such as immediate response to concentration changes, no cross interference, no carrier gases, which is proved to be a promising maintain-free technique instead of conventional DGA equipment.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7823395/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2016","volume":"23","issue":"6","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7823395/","accessionNumber":"16598713","displayDocTitle":"Tracing methane dissolved in transformer oil by tunable diode laser absorption spectrum","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Tracing methane dissolved in transformer oil by tunable diode laser absorption spectrum","sourcePdf":"p3435_jiang.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.083376S","chronDate":"Dec.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"94","isNumber":"7823166","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"94","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"7823166","articleId":"7823395","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":7823430,"authors":[{"name":"Siwei Liu","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Advanced Electromagnetic Engineering and Technology, Huazhong University of Science & Technology, Wuhan, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/94/7823166/7823430/7823430-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Siwei Liu (S'16) was born in Hubei, China in 1992.

It is difficult to obtain the condition of the power transformer by only one test method, so transformer fault diagnosis based on different experimental and simulation methods is widely recommended. In this paper, the transformer winding faults diagnosis based on FEM simulation and on-site experiments is described. Based on the FEM simulation, it is necessary to analyze the effect of the winding faults on the change of the electrical parameters. The typical types of winding faults, such as axial displacement, and radial deformation, etc. are taken into consideration. Different fault degrees are investigated in the simulation analysis. Using the parameters calculated in the FEM model, an equivalent circuit of the power transformer is present in ATP/EMTP to study the performance of typical on-site experiments, such as frequency response analysis (FRA) and short-circuit impendence (SCI) test. The frequency bands, which might be treated as the diagnostic bands in the FRA, are simulated and compared. It is found that the resonances in the frequency bands of 200-250 kHz and 350-450 kHz are able to describe the situation, where the displacement percentage of the winding is varying from 0% to 9%. The SCI values under different fault severity are also obtained and compared. Therefore, the diagnosis method can directly bridge the types and degrees of the winding faults with the experiment results. The operating states of several 110 kV power transformers are tracked, and it can be found that the simulation results show a better consistency with the on-site experiment results, and the proposed diagnosis method will help to discriminate the winding faults.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Dielectrics and Electrical

To counter such attacks, an automated spoof detector is used to distinguish images of fake fingerprints from those of real live fingerprints. Most spoof detectors adopt a machine learning approach, where a classifier is trained to distinguish between \u201cspoof\u201d and \u201clive\u201d samples. Such approaches require training samples from both classes. However, there are two fundamental concerns. Firstly, the number of spoof samples available during the training stage is typically much less than the number of live samples, resulting in imbalanced training sets. Secondly, the spoof detector may encounter spoofs fabricated using materials that were not \u201cseen\u201d in the training set, thereby failing to detect them. In order to alleviate some of these concerns, we adopt a One Class Support Vector Machine (OC-SVM) approach that predominantly uses training samples from only a single class, i.e., the live class, to generate a hyper sphere that encompasses most of the live samples. The goal is to learn the concept of a \u201clive\u201d fingerprint. The boundary of the hyper sphere is refined using a small number of spoof samples. The proposed method uses an ensemble of such OC-SVMs based on different feature sets. Experimental results on the LivDet2011 database show the advantages of the proposed ensemble of OC-SVMs for detecting spoofs generated from previously \u201cunseen\u201d materials.","doi":"10.1109/WIFS.2016.7823572","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE International Workshop on Information Forensics and Security (WIFS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE International Workshop on Information Forensics and Security (WIFS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7811906/7823570/07823572.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WIFS.2016.7823572","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7823570","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An ensemble of one-class SVMs for fingerprint spoof detection across different fabrication materials","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7823572","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-7 Dec. 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7823572/","displayDocTitle":"An ensemble of one-class SVMs for fingerprint spoof detection across different fabrication materials","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2016","accessionNumber":"16616961","htmlLink":"/document/7823572/","conferenceDate":"4-7 Dec. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An ensemble of one-class SVMs for fingerprint spoof detection across different fabrication materials","confLoc":"Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates","sourcePdf":"WIFS16paper109.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.078032S","chronDate":"4-7 Dec. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7811906","isNumber":"7823570","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7811906","citationCount":"27","xplore-issue":"7823570","articleId":"7823572","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7823595,"authors":[{"name":"Mohammad Hosseini","affiliation":["Adobe Research, San Jose, USA","University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC)"],"firstName":"Mohammad","lastName":"Hosseini","id":"37085736148"},{"name":"Viswanathan Swaminathan","affiliation":["Adobe Research, San Jose, USA"],"firstName":"Viswanathan","lastName":"Swaminathan","id":"37449404800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4571-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4572-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7823595","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":113,"citationCountPatent":6,"totalDownloads":2706},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Streaming media","Three-dimensional displays","Bandwidth","Geometry","Transform coding","Context","Multimedia communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational geometry","divide and conquer methods","mesh generation","multimedia systems","video streaming","virtual reality"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["3D media","immersive spherical video","adaptive bandwidth-efficient 360 VR video streaming system","divide and conquer approach","dynamic view-aware adaptation","video encoding","video packaging","MPEG-DASH SRD","field of view","3D geometry mesh","hexaface sphere","bandwidth savings"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["MPEG DASH SRD","Hexaface Sphere","View Awareness","Adaptive Streaming","360 VR Videos"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7823595","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE International Symposium on Multimedia (ISM)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7822824/7823367/07823595.pdf","startPage":"107","endPage":"110","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISM.2016.0028","doi":"10.1109/ISM.2016.0028","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7823367","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE International Symposium on Multimedia (ISM)","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive 360 VR Video Streaming: Divide and Conquer","abstract":"While traditional multimedia applications such as games and videos are still popular, there has been a significant interest in the recent years towards new 3D media such as 3D immersion and Virtual Reality (VR) applications, especially 360 VR videos. 360 VR video is an immersive spherical video where the user can look around during playback. Unfortunately, 360 VR videos are extremely bandwidth intensive, and therefore are difficult to stream at acceptable quality levels. In this paper, we propose an adaptive bandwidth-efficient 360 VR video streaming system using a divide and conquer approach. We propose a dynamic view-aware adaptation technique to tackle the huge bandwidth demands of 360 VR video streaming. We spatially divide the videos into multiple tiles while encoding and packaging, use MPEG-DASH SRD to describe the spatial relationship of tiles in the 360-degree space, and prioritize the tiles in the Field of View (FoV). In order to describe such tiled representations, we extend MPEG-DASH SRD to the 3D space of 360 VR videos. We spatially partition the underlying 3D mesh, and construct an efficient 3D geometry mesh called hexaface sphere to optimally represent a tiled 360 VR video in the 3D space. Our initial evaluation results report up to 72% bandwidth savings on 360 VR video streaming with minor negative quality impacts compared to the baseline scenario when no adaptations is applied.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7823595/","conferenceDate":"11-13 Dec. 2016","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-13 Dec. 2016","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"16617687","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2017","publicationDate":"Dec. 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7823595/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive 360 VR Video Streaming: Divide and Conquer","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive 360 VR Video Streaming: Divide and Conquer","confLoc":"San Jose, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"4571a107.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043417S","chronDate":"11-13 Dec. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7822824","isNumber":"7823367","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7822824","citationCount":"113","xplore-issue":"7823367","articleId":"7823595","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7823607,"authors":[{"name":"Ryosuke Shigenaka","affiliation":["Communication Technology Laboratory, Fuji Xerox Co., Ltd., Yokohama, Japan"],"firstName":"Ryosuke","lastName":"Shigenaka","id":"38467238200"},{"name":"Yukihiro Tsuboshita","affiliation":["Communication Technology Laboratory, Fuji Xerox Co., Ltd., Yokohama, Japan"],"firstName":"Yukihiro","lastName":"Tsuboshita","id":"37937389800"},{"name":"Noriji Kato","affiliation":["Communication Technology Laboratory, Fuji Xerox Co., Ltd., Yokohama, Japan"],"firstName":"Noriji","lastName":"Kato","id":"37412473000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4571-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4572-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7823607","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":193},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7823607","abstract":"To estimate demographic attributes such as gender and age of social media users from images posted by the users is a challenging problem because the demographic attributes are directly not shown in images. For such problem, prior approaches can be roughly separated into two types: one approach uses concept detection to detect pre-defined visual concepts which are then used as meta-data to estimate demographic attributes and the other approach directly uses content features such as Fisher Vector [19] which are extracted from images. In this paper we consider the way of combining these two approaches. We propose Multi-task Bilinear Model for integrating the detected concepts with the content features. In our proposed method, both the concept detector and the feature extractor can be jointly learned with end-to-end fashion. We evaluated the proposed method for the task of estimating user gender from Twitter images and found that it outperformed other baseline methods.","doi":"10.1109/ISM.2016.0040","startPage":"169","endPage":"172","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE International Symposium on Multimedia (ISM)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7822824/7823367/07823607.pdf","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE International Symposium on Multimedia (ISM)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISM.2016.0040","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7823367","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Content-Aware Multi-task Neural Networks for User Gender Inference Based on Social Media Images","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Visualization","Feature extraction","Detectors","Twitter","Neural networks","Estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["content-based retrieval","demography","feature extraction","image retrieval","neural nets","social networking (online)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["content-aware multitask neural networks","user gender inference","social media images","demographic attributes","social media users age","social media user gender","metadata","content features","Fisher vector extraction","multitask bilinear model","concept detector","feature extractor","Twitter images"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["User Profiling","Multi-task Learning","Convolutional Neural Networks"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7823607/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-13 Dec. 2016","displayDocTitle":"Content-Aware Multi-task Neural Networks for User Gender Inference Based on Social Media Images","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7823607/","publicationDate":"Dec. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2017","conferenceDate":"11-13 Dec. 2016","accessionNumber":"16617683","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Content-Aware Multi-task Neural Networks for User Gender Inference Based on Social Media Images","confLoc":"San Jose, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"4571a169.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068183S","chronDate":"11-13 Dec. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7822824","isNumber":"7823367","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7822824","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7823367","articleId":"7823607","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7823616,"authors":[{"name":"Holly H.

Therefore, we propose a joint customer pose and orientation estimation system from surveillance video by using deep Neural Network. This system composes the dependency between pose and orientation. In addition, considering the customer pose and orientation changes gradually over time, we apply a prediction structure to improve the system performance. In this structure, the estimated pose and orientation of one frame are both used to enhance the estimation of next frame. We also propose a two-step learning algorithm to train this network.

A more efficient way to achieve viewport adaptive streaming is to facilitate motion-constrained HEVC tiles.

Due to inherent diversity and the low duplicate property of images on social media, it brings forth many challenges in image retrieval, especially in identifying distinct features for a given object-of-interest. Previous literature approached this problem with extended General Hough Transform, where Hough space is analyzed for each specific object-of-interest. Different objects of interest produce different types of patterns in Hough space and no unified framework can be easily established to incorporate all those patterns. In this paper, we propose a unified framework based on convolutional neural network (CNN) for classifying the social media images and retrieving the images based on the probability score from the softmax classifier. In our framework, a reduced size CNN model is trained by distilling the knowledge from a pretrained full size CNN model, which is suitable for applications with limited training data such as ours and results in a higher accuracy in image retrieval as well as better performance in execution speed in comparison with the full size CNN model. Experiments on three image datasets relating to suspicious e-crime and terrorist involvement - Guy Fawkes masks, credit card logos, and ISIS logos show that our framework outperforms extended General Hough Transform and the full size CNN model.","doi":"10.1109/ISM.2016.0110","startPage":"493","endPage":"498","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE International Symposium on Multimedia (ISM)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISM.2016.0110","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7823367","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE International Symposium on Multimedia (ISM)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7822824/7823367/07823677.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Social Media Image Retrieval Using Distilled Convolutional Neural Network for Suspicious e-Crime and Terrorist Account Detection","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7823677/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Social Media Image Retrieval Using Distilled Convolutional Neural Network for Suspicious e-Crime and Terrorist Account Detection","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7823677/","accessionNumber":"16617673","publicationDate":"Dec. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2017","conferenceDate":"11-13 Dec. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-13 Dec. 2016","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Social Media Image Retrieval Using Distilled Convolutional Neural Network for Suspicious e-Crime and Terrorist Account Detection","confLoc":"San Jose, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"4571a493.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042286S","chronDate":"11-13 Dec. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7822824","isNumber":"7823367","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7822824","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"7823367","articleId":"7823677","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7823685,"authors":[{"name":"Junwoo Lee","affiliation":["Department of Computer and Information Engineering, Inha University, Incheon, Korea"],"firstName":"Junwoo","lastName":"Lee","id":"37086139888"},{"name":"Minseok Song","affiliation":["Department of Computer and Information Engineering, Inha University, Incheon, Korea"],"firstName":"Minseok","lastName":"Song","id":"37403901300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4571-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4572-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7823685","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":161},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cache Management for Video Servers by the Combined Use of DRAM and SSD","abstract":"The combination of cost and performance offered by solid-state disks (SSDs) makes them potentially suitable for caching in video servers. However, it is necessary to determine which video segments should be cached on SSD, and how to combine DRAM and SSD caching. We introduce a dynamic programming algorithm that allows for segment popularity in determining which videos will have their initial segments (prefixes) stored on SSD, and another algorithm that determines the intervals between pairs of consecutive requests for segments, and hence which segments should be stored on DRAM.

In these applications it is also common to use 4K resolution or higher per view for 360-degree videos. Consequently, this leads to technical challenges in handling the bandwidth requirements while keeping the system latency to the minimal. When the content is viewed with a HMD, a subset of the entire 360-degree video is displayed at a single point of time. To improve the resolution and picture quality of the displayed content, viewport based coding is desirable. In this regard, we investigated various viewport dependent projection schemes including the existing variants of Pyramidal projection. In this regard we propose the multi-resolution versions of Equirectangular and Cubemap projections. Additionally, we developed a methodology for comparing the rate-distortion performance of these projections. Based on the simulation results, it was observed that multi-resolution projections of Equirectangle and Cubemap outperform other projection schemes, significantly.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7823693/","conferenceDate":"11-13 Dec. 2016","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-13 Dec. 2016","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"16617748","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2017","publicationDate":"Dec. 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7823693/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Viewport-Adaptive Encoding and Streaming of 360-Degree Video for Virtual Reality Applications","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Viewport-Adaptive Encoding and Streaming of 360-Degree Video for Virtual Reality Applications","confLoc":"San Jose, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"4571a583.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.076887S","chronDate":"11-13 Dec. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7822824","isNumber":"7823367","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7822824","citationCount":"49","xplore-issue":"7823367","articleId":"7823693","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":7823700,"authors":[{"name":"Ziqi Zhu","affiliation":["Signal & Information Processing Laboratory, Beijing University of Technology, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Ziqi","lastName":"Zhu","id":"37086186650"},{"name":"Li Zhuo","affiliation":["Signal & Information Processing Laboratory, Beijing University of Technology, Beijing, China","Collaborative Innovation Center of Electric Vehicles in Beijing, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Li","lastName":"Zhuo","id":"38351500300"},{"name":"Panling Qu","affiliation":["Signal & Information Processing Laboratory, Beijing University of Technology, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Panling","lastName":"Qu","id":"37085838223"},{"name":"Kailong Zhou","affiliation":["Signal & Information Processing Laboratory, Beijing University of Technology, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Kailong","lastName":"Zhou","id":"37085835128"},{"name":"Jing Zhang","affiliation":["Signal & Information Processing Laboratory, Beijing University of Technology, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Jing","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37881527600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4571-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4572-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7823700","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":730},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image recognition","Feature extraction","Training","Sensors","Road transportation","Rain"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Big Data","computer vision","geophysics computing","image recognition","meteorology","neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["extreme weather recognition method","computer vision","convolutional neural networks","Big Data","WeatherDataset","pretraining step","ILSVRC-2012 dataset","GoogLeNet","fine tuning step","recognition accuracy rate","CNN"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["extreme weather recognition","weather dataset","convolutional neural networks","GoogLeNet","fine-tuning"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7823700","abstract":"Extreme weather always brings potential risk to driving, which leads to people's life and property being put into great dangers. Therefore, the automatic recognition of extreme weather plays an important role in the application of the highway traffic condition warning, automobile auxiliary driving, climate analysis and so on. Generally, multiple sensors are adopted in traditional methods of automatic extreme weather recognition with artificial participation and low accuracy. A new extreme weather recognition method based on images by using computer vision manners has been proposed in this paper. Since the weather is affected by many factors, features that can accurately represent various weather characteristics are difficult to be extracted. Therefore, in this paper, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are applied to settle this problem. Features of extreme weather and recognition models are generated from big data. Moreover, a large-scale extreme weather dataset, \"WeatherDataset\", has been collected, in which 16635 extreme weather images are divided into four classes (sunny, rainstorm, blizzard, and fog), and complex scenes are coverd. A recognition model for extreme weather is obtained through two steps: Pre-training and Fine Tuning. In Pre-training step, ILSVRC-2012 Dataset is trained to obtain the model of ILSVRC using GoogLeNet. A more accurate model for extreme weather recognition is obatined by further fine-tuning GoogLeNet on WeatherDataset. The experimental results show that the proposed method is able to achieve a high performance with the recognition accuracy rate of 94.5% and can meet the requirements of some real applications.","doi":"10.1109/ISM.2016.0133","startPage":"621","endPage":"625","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE International Symposium on Multimedia (ISM)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISM.2016.0133","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7823367","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE International Symposium on Multimedia (ISM)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7822824/7823367/07823700.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Extreme Weather Recognition Using Convolutional Neural Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7823700/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Extreme Weather Recognition Using Convolutional Neural Networks","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7823700/","accessionNumber":"16617784","publicationDate":"Dec. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2017","conferenceDate":"11-13 Dec. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-13 Dec. 2016","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Extreme Weather Recognition Using Convolutional Neural Networks","confLoc":"San Jose, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"4571a621.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071516S","chronDate":"11-13 Dec. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7822824","isNumber":"7823367","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7822824","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"7823367","articleId":"7823700","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":7823728,"authors":[{"name":"Jing Wang","affiliation":["School of Computer Science, Wuhan University, Wuhan, P.R.China"],"firstName":"Jing","lastName":"Wang","id":"37078534600"},{"name":"Huyin Zhang","affiliation":["School of Computer Science, Wuhan University, Wuhan, P.R.China"],"firstName":"Huyin","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37836006000"},{"name":"Xing Tang","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Technology, Wuhan University of Technology, Wuhan, P.R.

Most existing routing solutions for Cognitive Radio Ad Hoc Networks (CRAHNs) or VANETs cannot be directly applied to CR-VANETs due to the high mobility of vehicles and varying availability of spectrums. To fill this gap, with the proliferation of delay tolerant applications, this paper presents a delay tolerant routing strategy for CR-VANETs with the object of maximizing the packet delivery ratio from the source to the destination. The proposed routing scheme is composed of two parts: the routing policy and the message replication policy. In the first policy, we select a concurrent forwarding set under the restriction of CR spectrum holes, and choose an optimized routing path for the next hop. In the second policy, we propose a hybrid and adaptable method relying on Drop-Oldest and Drop-Most strategies, to reduce the delivery cost. Through extensive simulations, we demonstrate that the proposed delay tolerant routing mechanism provides with better packet delivery ratio compared to state-of-the-art protocols.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICPADS.2016.0013","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7823715","startPage":"24","endPage":"31","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE 22nd International Conference on Parallel and Distributed Systems (ICPADS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7822825/7823715/07823728.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Delay Tolerant Routing for Cognitive Radio Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7823728/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Dec. 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7823728/","displayDocTitle":"Delay Tolerant Routing for Cognitive Radio Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks","conferenceDate":"13-16 Dec. 2016","publicationDate":"Dec. 2016","accessionNumber":"16617852","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Delay Tolerant Routing for Cognitive Radio Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks","confLoc":"Wuhan, China","sourcePdf":"4457a024.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069531S","chronDate":"13-16 Dec. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7822825","isNumber":"7823715","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7822825","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"7823715","articleId":"7823728","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":7823734,"authors":[{"name":"Yiwei Zhuo","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Yiwei","lastName":"Zhuo","id":"37086047625"},{"name":"Hongzi Zhu","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Hongzi","lastName":"Zhu","id":"37085357967"},{"name":"Hua Xue","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Hua","lastName":"Xue","id":"37086058940"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4457-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-5382-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1521-9097"}],"articleNumber":"7823734","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":15,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1077},"abstract":"WiFi technology has gained a wide prevalence for not only wireless communication but also pervasive sensing. A wide variety of emerging applications leverage accurate measurements of the Channel State Information (CSI) information exposed by commodity WiFi devices. Due to hardware imperfection of commodity WiFi devices, the frequency response of internal signal processing circuit is mixed with the real channel frequency response in passband, which makes deriving accurate channel frequency response from CSI measurements a challenging task. In this paper, we conduct an extensive empirical studies on CSI measurements and identify a non-negligible non-linear CSI phase error, which cannot be compensated by existing calibration strategies targeted at linear CSI phase errors. We conduct intensive analysis on the properties of such non-linear CSI phase errors and find that such errors are prevalent among various WiFi devices. Furthermore, they are stable along time and for different time-of-flight but related to the received signal strength indication (RSSI) of the received signal, the band frequency and the specific radios used between a transmission pair. Based on these key observations, we infer that the IQ imbalance issue in the direct-down-conversion architecture of commodity WiFi devices is the root source of the non-linear CSI phase errors. Our findings are essential to CSI-based applications and call for new practical strategies to remedy non-linear phase errors.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Phase measurement","IEEE

Large-scale systems of linear matrix equations (LME) are commonly deployed in scientific and engineering fields, which is a computationally complex task. Thus, it is necessary to design a protocol for practically outsourcing large-scale systems of LME to a malicious cloud. For this purpose, we propose a protocol called OutLME in this paper. In OutLME, we adopt a special permutation technique for the client to transform the original linear matrix equation into a randomized one and decrypt the result returned from cloud into the right one of original problem. As to robust cheating resistance, we propose an effective verification algorithm by utilizing the algebraic property of matrix-vector operations. In addition, both the chosen permutation technique and result verification mechanism incur close-to-zero additional cost on both the cloud and the client, so our proposed protocol is efficient. In the end, the theoretical analysis and the experimental evaluation are provided to demonstrate the validity of OutLME.","doi":"10.1109/ICPADS.2016.0066","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE 22nd International Conference on Parallel and Distributed Systems (ICPADS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE 22nd International Conference on Parallel and Distributed Systems (ICPADS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7822825/7823715/07823781.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICPADS.2016.0066","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7823715","startPage":"438","endPage":"447","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Outsourcing Large-Scale Systems of Linear Matrix Equations in Cloud Computing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7823781","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Outsourcing Large-Scale Systems of Linear Matrix Equations in Cloud Computing","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Dec. 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7823781/","conferenceDate":"13-16 Dec. 2016","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2016","accessionNumber":"16617886","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7823781/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Outsourcing Large-Scale Systems of Linear Matrix Equations in Cloud Computing","confLoc":"Wuhan, China","sourcePdf":"4457a438.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.114274S","chronDate":"13-16 Dec. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7822825","isNumber":"7823715","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7822825","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"7823715","articleId":"7823781","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7823785,"authors":[{"name":"Yuchuan Tian","affiliation":["Wuhan National Lab for Optoelectronics, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Yuchuan","lastName":"Tian","id":"37086186279"},{"name":"Fang Wang","affiliation":["Wuhan National Lab for Optoelectronics, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Fang","lastName":"Wang","id":"37086181963"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4457-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-5382-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1521-9097"}],"articleNumber":"7823785","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":179},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7823785","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["File systems","Memory management","Random access memory","Data structures","Semantics","Metadata"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["DRAM chips","input-output programs"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["storage-class memory","two-level storage model","volatile memory","nonvolatile hard disk","persistent memory stemming","general-purpose SCM-access methodology","persistent memory server engine","PMSE","user-level process","unified optimization","transactional mechanism","persistent memory allocation","persistent memory optimization","persistent memory transaction","fine-grained data abstraction","file-system levels","persistent-heap levels","write-intensive workloads"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Storage-Class Memory","Persistent Memory"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICPADS.2016.0070","endPage":"481","startPage":"474","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE 22nd International Conference on Parallel and Distributed Systems (ICPADS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE 22nd International Conference on Parallel and Distributed Systems (ICPADS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7822825/7823715/07823785.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICPADS.2016.0070","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7823715","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Unified Access Manner for Storage-Class Memory","abstract":"Persistent memory has the potential to become universal storage for memory and storage uses. Unfortunately, our current programming model is still only geared to a two-level storage model supporting different semantics to access volatile memory and non-volatile hard disk. This, however, leads a performance gap in accessing the same persistent memory stemming from the difference in the aforementioned semantics and the performance degradation introduced by not appropriately adapting to characteristics of SCM. We propose a general-purpose SCM-access methodology for persistent data on universal storage to hide such semantics difference. Specifically, we design the Persistent Memory Server Engine (PMSE), a special user-level process based on a unified optimization and transactional mechanism, that provides a group of general calls related to allocation, optimization, transactions of persistent memory and a fine-grained data abstraction for persisting data. Our prototype evaluation of PMSE shows that, compared to several state-of-the-art solutions at the file-system and persistent-heap levels, PMSE can provide 4\u00d7 better performance than kernel-based persistent-memory file system, 1.7\u00d7 and 1.5\u00d7 better performance than user-level persistent-memory file system and persistent heap, under the write-intensive workloads. For traditional applications, applications with IOs achieve similar performance to those without IOs.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Dec. 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7823785/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7823785/","accessionNumber":"16617959","conferenceDate":"13-16 Dec. 2016","publicationDate":"Dec. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A Unified Access Manner for Storage-Class Memory","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Unified Access Manner for Storage-Class Memory","confLoc":"Wuhan, China","sourcePdf":"4457a474.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053744S","chronDate":"13-16 Dec. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7822825","isNumber":"7823715","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7822825","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7823715","articleId":"7823785","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":7823793,"authors":[{"name":"Qianbin Xia","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Virginia Commonwealth University"],"firstName":"Qianbin","lastName":"Xia","id":"37085613813"},{"name":"Weijun Xiao","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Virginia Commonwealth University"],"firstName":"Weijun","lastName":"Xiao","id":"38525872400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4457-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-5382-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1521-9097"}],"articleNumber":"7823793","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":284},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Parity check codes","Error correction codes","Performance evaluation","Threshold voltage","Programming","Decoding","Particle separators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","decoding","error correction codes","flash memories","integrated circuit reliability","performance evaluation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MLC flash performance improvement","workload-aware differentiated ECC","multilevel cell technologies","flash memory","device reliability","incremental-step pulse programming","programming accuracy","raw storage reliability","error-tolerance ability","error correction strength","ISPP scheme","decoding complexity","SSD write performance improvement","write-only logical pages","read-only logical pages","overlapped logical pages","solid state disk"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["ISPP","BCH","LDPC","Bloom Filter","Flash Performance"]}],"abstract":"The adoption of small geometries and multi-level cell (MLC) technologies significantly expands the capacity and drops the price of flash memory, which, at the same time, noticeably degrades the performance and reliability of the devices. As incremental-step pulse programming (ISPP) scheme is used to increase the programming accuracy for MLC cells, there is a trade-off between the SSD write performance and raw storage reliability. What's more, ECC is widely used in SSDs to provide error-tolerance ability. Therefore, if we could use stronger ECC to increase error correction strength, a low-cost write with coarser step sizes could be applied in the ISPP scheme to promote the write performance. However, stronger ECC scheme may hurt the read performance due to the increased decoding complexity and latency. In this paper, we propose a workload-aware differentiated ECC scheme to improve the SSD write performance without sacrificing the read performance. The main idea is to dynamically classify the logical pages into three categories: write-only, readonly, and overlapped part. For write-only logical pages, low-cost write with strong ECC scheme will be applied to increase the write performance. For write logical pages in the overlapped part, the low-cost writes with strong ECC will be selectively used based on their relative write and read hotness. While for any read logical pages encoded with a stronger ECC, we will rewrite them with the normal-cost write and ECC scheme if their hotness exceed a pre-defined threshold. The evaluation results show that our workload-aware differentiated ECC scheme could reduce the write and read response times by 48% and 11% on average, respectively. Even compared with the latest previous work, our workload-aware design can still gain about 4% write performance and 11% read performance improvements.","doi":"10.1109/ICPADS.2016.0078","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE 22nd International Conference on Parallel and Distributed Systems (ICPADS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE 22nd International Conference on Parallel and Distributed Systems (ICPADS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7822825/7823715/07823793.pdf","startPage":"545","endPage":"552","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7823715","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICPADS.2016.0078","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improving MLC Flash Performance with Workload-Aware Differentiated ECC","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7823793","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Dec. 2016","displayDocTitle":"Improving MLC Flash Performance with Workload-Aware Differentiated ECC","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7823793/","publicationDate":"Dec. 2016","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2017","accessionNumber":"16617897","htmlLink":"/document/7823793/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"13-16 Dec. 2016","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improving MLC Flash Performance with Workload-Aware Differentiated ECC","confLoc":"Wuhan, China","sourcePdf":"4457a545.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.089888S","chronDate":"13-16 Dec. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7822825","isNumber":"7823715","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7822825","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7823715","articleId":"7823793","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7823797,"authors":[{"name":"Cai Tao","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Communication Engineering, Jiangsu University, ZhenJiang, China"],"firstName":"Cai","lastName":"Tao","id":"37086187903"},{"name":"Niu Dejiao","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Communication Engineering, Jiangsu University, ZhenJiang, China"],"firstName":"Niu","lastName":"Dejiao","id":"38111687000"},{"name":"He Yao","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Communication Engineering, Jiangsu University, ZhenJiang, China"],"firstName":"He","lastName":"Yao","id":"37086189433"},{"name":"Zhu Yeqing","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Communication Engineering, Jiangsu University, ZhenJiang, China"],"firstName":"Zhu","lastName":"Yeqing","id":"37086188523"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4457-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-5382-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1521-9097"}],"articleNumber":"7823797","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":254},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7823797","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Nonvolatile memory","File systems","Metadata","Performance evaluation","Memory management","Layout","Computer science"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["buffer storage","tree data structures"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hybrid NVM devices","complex file system","NVMCFS","two layer radix-tree","complex file structures","file data distributed strategy","buffer","asymmetric call","I/O performance","nonvolatile memory"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["SCM","File System","Non-volatile Memory","Hybrid Storage"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICPADS.2016.0082","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE 22nd International Conference on Parallel and Distributed Systems (ICPADS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE 22nd International Conference on Parallel and Distributed Systems (ICPADS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7822825/7823715/07823797.pdf","startPage":"577","endPage":"584","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICPADS.2016.0082","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7823715","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"NVMCFS: Complex File System for Hybrid NVM","abstract":"Due to the price limitation and the number of DIMM slot, Byte and Block addressable NVM devices should coexist in the massive Storage Class Memory(SCM).

Virtual machine placement has been demonstrated as an effective method for energy saving. In addition to constraints caused by the physical machine resources such as CPU and memory (PM-constraints), the constraints caused by the network resource such as bandwidth (Net-constraints) are also crucial, since virtual machines are not isolated and require communication with each other to exchange data. However, most current research on data center power optimization only focuses on server resource. As a result, the optimization results are often inferior, because server consolidation without considering the network may cause traffic congestion and thus degraded network performance. We take the traffic demands between virtual machines into consideration and formulate the virtual machine placement problem under both PM-constraints and Net-constraints to minimize the energy cost, and propose an approach based on ant colony optimization to solve the problem. We evaluate the expected performance of our proposed algorithm through a simulation study, providing strong indications to the superiority of our proposed solution.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Energy-Aware Ant Colony Algorithm for Network-Aware Virtual Machine Placement in Cloud Computing","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE 22nd International Conference on Parallel and Distributed Systems (ICPADS)","doi":"10.1109/ICPADS.2016.0093","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE 22nd International Conference on Parallel and Distributed Systems (ICPADS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7822825/7823715/07823808.pdf","startPage":"669","endPage":"676","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICPADS.2016.0093","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7823715","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7823808","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7823808/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Dec. 2016","displayDocTitle":"An Energy-Aware Ant Colony Algorithm for Network-Aware Virtual Machine Placement in Cloud Computing","conferenceDate":"13-16 Dec. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7823808/","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2017","publicationDate":"Dec. 2016","accessionNumber":"16617876","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Energy-Aware Ant Colony Algorithm for Network-Aware Virtual Machine Placement in Cloud Computing","confLoc":"Wuhan, China","sourcePdf":"4457a669.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.123876S","chronDate":"13-16 Dec. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7822825","isNumber":"7823715","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7822825","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"7823715","articleId":"7823808","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7823814,"authors":[{"name":"Junlong Zhou","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Technology, East China Normal University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Junlong","lastName":"Zhou","id":"37085724999"},{"name":"Jianfei Chen","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Technology, East China Normal University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Jianfei","lastName":"Chen","id":"37086084294"},{"name":"Kun Cao","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Technology, East China Normal University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Kun","lastName":"Cao","id":"37086036223"},{"name":"Tongquan Wei","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Technology, East China Normal University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Tongquan","lastName":"Wei","id":"37410847100"},{"name":"Mingsong Chen","affiliation":["Shanghai Key Laboratory of Trustworthy Computing, East China Normal University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Mingsong","lastName":"Chen","id":"37407025500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4457-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-5382-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1521-9097"}],"articleNumber":"7823814","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":151},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Servers","Renewable energy sources","Resource management","Games","Energy states","Program processors","Throughput"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["game theory","renewable energy sources","renewable materials"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["game theoretic energy allocation","renewable powered in-situ server systems","operating environment","utility infrastructure","renewable energy","energy management","harvested energy","Nash bargaining solution","heuristic algorithm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Renewable energy allocation","In-situ server","Game theory","Nash bargaining solution"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7823814","abstract":"In-situ server systems are deployed in very special operating environment to handle in-situ workloads that are normally generated from environmentally sensitive areas or remote places that lack established utility infrastructure. This very special operating environment of in-situ servers urges such systems to be 100 percent powered by renewable energy. However, existing energy management schemes assume a hybrid supply of grid and renewable energy, hence are not well suited for 100 percent renewable powered in-situ server systems. In this paper, we tackle the problem of allocating harvested energy to 100 percent renewable powered server systems for optimizing both the overall system throughput and throughput of individual servers. From a game theoretic perspective, we model the energy allocation problem as a cooperative game among multiple servers and derive a Nash bargaining solution. Based on the Nash bargaining solution, we then propose a heuristic algorithm that determines the energy allocation strategies according to system energy states. Experimental results show that our proposed game theoretic approach achieves a high throughput from perspectives of both the overall system and individual servers.","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE 22nd International Conference on Parallel and Distributed Systems (ICPADS)","startPage":"721","endPage":"728","doi":"10.1109/ICPADS.2016.0099","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICPADS.2016.0099","pdfPath":"/iel7/7822825/7823715/07823814.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE 22nd International Conference on Parallel and Distributed Systems (ICPADS)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7823715","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Game Theoretic Energy Allocation for Renewable Powered In-Situ Server Systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7823814/","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Dec. 2016","conferenceDate":"13-16 Dec. 2016","displayDocTitle":"Game Theoretic Energy Allocation for Renewable Powered In-Situ Server Systems","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2017","publicationDate":"Dec. 2016","accessionNumber":"16617939","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7823814/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Game Theoretic Energy Allocation for Renewable Powered In-Situ Server Systems","confLoc":"Wuhan, China","sourcePdf":"4457a721.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.087541S","chronDate":"13-16 Dec. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7822825","isNumber":"7823715","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7822825","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"7823715","articleId":"7823814","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7823819,"authors":[{"name":"Hui Yin","affiliation":["Department of Mathematics and Computer Science, Changsha University, Hunan, China"],"firstName":"Hui","lastName":"Yin","id":"37085853237"},{"name":"Zheng Qin","affiliation":["Department of Mathematics and Computer Science, Changsha University, Hunan, China"],"firstName":"Zheng","lastName":"Qin","id":"37594217000"},{"name":"Jixin Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Mathematics and Computer Science, Changsha University, Hunan, China"],"firstName":"Jixin","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37085404443"},{"name":"Wenjie Li","affiliation":["Department of Mathematics and Computer Science, Changsha University, Hunan, China"],"firstName":"Wenjie","lastName":"Li","id":"37086061067"},{"name":"Lu Ou","affiliation":["Department of Mathematics and Computer Science, Changsha University, Hunan, China"],"firstName":"Lu","lastName":"Ou","id":"37085853906"},{"name":"Yupeng Hu","affiliation":["Department of Mathematics and Computer Science, Changsha University, Hunan, China"],"firstName":"Yupeng","lastName":"Hu","id":"37086067540"},{"name":"Keqin Li","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, State University of New York, New York, USA"],"firstName":"Keqin","lastName":"Li","id":"37085471990"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4457-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-5382-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1521-9097"}],"articleNumber":"7823819","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":263},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Secure Conjunctive Multi-Keyword Search for Multiple Data Owners in Cloud Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE 22nd International Conference on Parallel and Distributed Systems (ICPADS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7822825/7823715/07823819.pdf","startPage":"761","endPage":"768","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE 22nd International Conference on Parallel and Distributed Systems (ICPADS)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICPADS.2016.0104","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7823715","doi":"10.1109/ICPADS.2016.0104","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cloud computing","Indexes","Encryption","Computational modeling","Servers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","cryptography","query processing","text analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["secure conjunctive multikeyword search","multiple data owners","cloud computing","encrypted cloud data","data security","system flexibility","secure query scheme","secure index","data files","authorized data user","temporary query keys","keywords matching"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cloud computing","Conjunctive keyword query","Multiple data owners","Secure query"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7823819","abstract":"Recently, secure search over encrypted cloud data has become a hot research spot and challenging task.

However, the limited write endurance is one of the major obstacles for PCM to be practically applied. Traditional wear-leveling techniques try to uniformly balance the write traffics under both general applications and malicious attacks to enhance the PCM lifetime. However, these techniques fail to consider the endurance variation in PCM chips, and result in severe lifespan degradation since uniform write distribution leads to the weakest cell to be worn out much earlier. In this paper, we propose a weight-based algebraic wear-leveling (WAWL) scheme to balance wear rates (i.e., write traffics/endurance) in a secure manner according to the endurance distribution. In WAWL, the entire memory space is divided into multiple regions. When the number of the writes to a region reaches a threshold (i.e., swapping interval), the region is swapped with a randomly chosen region. The basic idea behind WAWL is that the swapping interval and the chosen probability of each region are variable and associated with the endurance metric of the region. By deploying suitable swapping interval and chosen probability, WAWL achieves uniform wear-rate distribution across the entire memory in an undetectable way. In addition, to reduce space consumption and alleviate performance degradation during region swapping, we propose a fine-grained swapping scheme which migrates the lines one-by-one between the candidate regions. Experimental evaluation driven by the various attacks demonstrates that WAWL significantly increases the PCM lifespan and improves security with slight performance degradation and affordable hardware overhead.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Dec. 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7823831/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7823831/","accessionNumber":"16617866","conferenceDate":"13-16 Dec. 2016","publicationDate":"Dec. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Increasing Lifetime and Security of Phase-Change Memory with Endurance Variation","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Increasing Lifetime and Security of Phase-Change Memory with Endurance Variation","confLoc":"Wuhan, China","sourcePdf":"4457a861.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069067S","chronDate":"13-16 Dec. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7822825","isNumber":"7823715","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7822825","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"7823715","articleId":"7823831","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-09"},{"_id":7823836,"authors":[{"name":"Yaobin Wang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Technology, University of Science and Technology of China, China","Department of Computer Science and Technology, Southwest University of Science and Technology, China"],"firstName":"Yaobin","lastName":"Wang","id":"37540209200"},{"name":"Hong An","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Technology, University of Science and Technology of China, China"],"firstName":"Hong","lastName":"An","id":"37531229100"},{"name":"Zhiqin Liu","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Technology, Southwest University of Science and Technology, China"],"firstName":"Zhiqin","lastName":"Liu","id":"37533654300"},{"name":"Tao Liu","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Technology, University of Science and Technology of China, China","Department of Computer Science and Technology, Southwest University of Science and Technology, China"],"firstName":"Tao","lastName":"Liu","id":"37600496300"},{"name":"Dongmei Zhao","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Technology, University of Science and Technology of China, China","Department of Computer Science and Technology, Southwest University of Science and Technology, China"],"firstName":"Dongmei","lastName":"Zhao","id":"37086135672"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4457-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-5382-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1521-9097"}],"articleNumber":"7823836","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":125},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multicore processing","Instruction sets","Graphics processing units","Programming","Neural networks","Hardware"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["backpropagation","multiprocessing systems","neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["backpropagation neural network","multicore architecture","speculative execution model","hardware design","programming model","speculative multicore platform","parallelized BPNN"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["thread level speculation","parallel programming","back propagation","multicore"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7823836","abstract":"Applications typically exhibit extremely different performance characteristics depending on the accelerator.

In each guest operating system a front-end driver is added to identify the transaction logging semantic from specific database engine. At the hypervisor layer a dedicated back-end driver consolidates all transaction logging I/Os from guest font-end drivers and then persist them into a consecutive data area on the shared storage device, resulting in the relatively sequential logging I/O.

In this paper, we accelerated the deep network training using many GPUs. We have developed a framework based on Caffe called Caffe-HPC that can utilize computing clusters with multiple GPUs to train large models. Caffe[6] provides multimedia scientists and practitioners with a clean and modifiable framework for state-of-the-art deep learning algorithms and a collection of reference models. And Caffe-HPC retains all the features of the original Caffe, the model trained on original Caffe can be continue to trained on Caffe-HPC. It provides a convenient solution for people who are using Caffe and want to speed up the training. Using an Asynchronous Stochastic Gradient Descent optimizer, We made a good acceleration on training a CNN model on ILSVRC[5] 2012 dataset. And we have compared the convergence of different SGD algorithms. We believe our work will makes it possible to train larger networks on larger training sets in a reasonable amount of time.","doi":"10.1109/ICPADS.2016.0126","startPage":"942","endPage":"947","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE 22nd International Conference on Parallel and Distributed Systems (ICPADS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7822825/7823715/07823841.pdf","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE 22nd International Conference on Parallel and Distributed Systems (ICPADS)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICPADS.2016.0126","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7823715","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Using Supercomputer to Speed up Neural Network Training","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Servers","Training","Graphics processing units","Neural networks","Machine learning","Computational modeling","Acceleration"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["gradient methods","graphics processing units","mainframes","neural nets","parallel machines","stochastic processes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["supercomputer","speed up neural network training","deep learning","GPU","Caffe-HPC","computing clusters","multimedia scientists","asynchronous stochastic gradient descent optimizer"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["parallel computation","supercomputing","asynchronous stochastic gradient descent","parameter server","neural network","deep learning"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7823841/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Dec. 2016","displayDocTitle":"Using Supercomputer to Speed up Neural Network Training","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7823841/","publicationDate":"Dec. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2017","conferenceDate":"13-16 Dec. 2016","accessionNumber":"16617871","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Using Supercomputer to Speed up Neural Network Training","confLoc":"Wuhan","sourcePdf":"4457a942.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.077148S","chronDate":"13-16 Dec. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7822825","isNumber":"7823715","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7822825","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7823715","articleId":"7823841","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":7823842,"authors":[{"name":"Han Bao","affiliation":["Science and Technology on Parallel and Distributed Processing Laboratory, College of Computer National University of Defense Technology Changsha, Hunan, P.

In many cases, anomalies are composed of a sequence of multi-dimensional data, and it's necessary to detect this type of anomalies accurately and efficiently over data stream. Existing online methods of anomaly detection merely focus on the single-dimensional sequence. What's more, current studies about multi-dimensional sequence are mainly concentrated on static database. However, the anomaly detection for multi-dimensional sequence over data stream is much more difficult, due to the complexity of multidimensional sequence processing, the dynamic nature of data stream and the unbalance between normal and abnormal data. Facing these challenges, we propose an anomaly detection method for multi-dimensional sequence over data stream based on cost sensitive support vector machine (C-SVM) called ADMS. First, to improve the accuracy and efficiency, the ADMS transforms multi-dimensional sequences into feature vectors in a lossless way and prunes worthless features of these vectors. And then, the ADMS can detect abnormal sequences over dynamically imbalanced data stream by lively testing these vectors based on C-SVM. Experiments show that the false negative rate (FNR) of the ADMS is lower than 5%, the false positive rate (FPR) is lower than 7%, and the throughput is improved 42% by pruning worthless features. In addition, the AMDS performs well when there are concept drifts over the data stream.","doi":"10.1109/ICPADS.2016.0127","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE 22nd International Conference on Parallel and Distributed Systems (ICPADS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE 22nd International Conference on Parallel and Distributed Systems (ICPADS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7822825/7823715/07823842.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICPADS.2016.0127","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7823715","startPage":"948","endPage":"955","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A C-SVM Based Anomaly Detection Method for Multi-Dimensional Sequence over Data Stream","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7823842","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A C-SVM Based Anomaly Detection Method for Multi-Dimensional Sequence over Data Stream","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Dec. 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7823842/","conferenceDate":"13-16 Dec. 2016","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2016","accessionNumber":"16617863","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7823842/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A C-SVM Based Anomaly Detection Method for Multi-Dimensional Sequence over Data Stream","confLoc":"Wuhan, China","sourcePdf":"4457a948.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056999S","chronDate":"13-16 Dec. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7822825","isNumber":"7823715","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7822825","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7823715","articleId":"7823842","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7823852,"authors":[{"name":"Hiroko Midorikawa","affiliation":["Department of Computer and Information Science, JST CREST, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Hiroko","lastName":"Midorikawa","id":"37352373300"},{"name":"Hideyuki Tan","affiliation":["Department of Computer and Information Science, JST CREST, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Hideyuki","lastName":"Tan","id":"37085496024"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4457-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-5382-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1521-9097"}],"articleNumber":"7823852","dbTime":"18 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":116},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Decision support systems","Random access memory","Tuning","Conferences","Flash memories","Layout"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cache storage","DRAM chips","flash memories","memory architecture","mobile computing","optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["SSD-equipped clusters","flash-based out-of-core stencil computation algorithm","large-scale stencil computation","locality-aware algorithm","hierarchical blocking scheme","Blk-Tune","nonuniform memory architecture","NUMA"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Non-volatile memory","flash memory","memory hierarchy","temporal blocking","stencil","out-of-core","asynchronous I/O","access locality","NUMA","auto-tuning","SSD-equipped cluster"]}],"abstract":"This paper proposes a new scheme for solving data size requirements for a large-scale stencil computation, which are greater than the total size of the main memories of nodes in a cluster. It utilizes distributed flash SSDs over cluster nodes as an extension to the main memory with a locality-aware algorithm. Three algorithms with a different hierarchical blocking scheme for three memory tiers, namely, flash SSD, DRAM, and cache, are proposed, and they are evaluated in different platforms and flash devices. They utilize not only highly parallel asynchronous input/output in flash SSDs, but also appropriate blocking parameters by using an auto-tuning system named Blk-Tune. They also overcome the performance degradation caused by the non-uniform memory architecture (NUMA). The optimized algorithms for single nodes are extended for multi-nodes and evaluated in a cluster with traditional SATA SSDs, as well as with state-of-the-art flash devices, such as low-power and cost-effective M.2 NVMe flash SSDs. With the use of our scheme and distributed flash devices in a cluster, large-scale stencil problems can be solved with a limited number of nodes and a moderate size of main memories.","doi":"10.1109/ICPADS.2016.0137","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE 22nd International Conference on Parallel and Distributed Systems (ICPADS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE 22nd International Conference on Parallel and Distributed Systems (ICPADS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7822825/7823715/07823852.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICPADS.2016.0137","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7823715","startPage":"1031","endPage":"1040","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Evaluation of Flash-Based Out-of-Core Stencil Computation Algorithms for SSD-Equipped Clusters","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7823852","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Evaluation of Flash-Based Out-of-Core Stencil Computation Algorithms for SSD-Equipped Clusters","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Dec. 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7823852/","conferenceDate":"13-16 Dec. 2016","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2016","accessionNumber":"16617946","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7823852/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Evaluation of Flash-Based Out-of-Core Stencil Computation Algorithms for SSD-Equipped Clusters","confLoc":"Wuhan, China","sourcePdf":"4457b031.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057655S","chronDate":"13-16 Dec. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7822825","isNumber":"7823715","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7822825","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7823715","articleId":"7823852","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7823856,"authors":[{"name":"Yangyang Zhao","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Technology, University of Science and Technology of China (USTC), Hefei, China"],"firstName":"Yangyang","lastName":"Zhao","id":"37086167791"},{"name":"Qi Yu","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Technology, University of Science and Technology of China (USTC), Hefei, China"],"firstName":"Qi","lastName":"Yu","id":"37085698846"},{"name":"Xuda Zhou","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Technology, University of Science and Technology of China (USTC), Hefei, China"],"firstName":"Xuda","lastName":"Zhou","id":"37086170518"},{"name":"Xuehai Zhou","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Technology, University of Science and Technology of China (USTC), Hefei, China"],"firstName":"Xuehai","lastName":"Zhou","id":"37406428200"},{"name":"Xi Li","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Technology, University of Science and Technology of China (USTC), Hefei, China"],"firstName":"Xi","lastName":"Li","id":"37406918700"},{"name":"Chao Wang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Technology, University of Science and Technology of China (USTC), Hefei, China"],"firstName":"Chao","lastName":"Wang","id":"37676580400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4457-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-5382-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1521-9097"}],"articleNumber":"7823856","dbTime":"31 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":736},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neurons","Field programmable gate arrays","Pipelines","Acceleration","Biological neural networks","Pipeline processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","inference mechanisms","neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["pipeline energy-efficient accelerator","inference process","deep neural networks","DNN","PIE","hardware accelerators","field programmable gate arrays","layer-wise structure","data dependency","computation time reduction","calculation orders","parallel computation","Zedboard development kit","Xilinx Zynq-7000 FPGA","Intel Core i7 CPU","NVIDIA K40C GPU","none-pipelined method"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["accelerator","deep neural networks","FPGA","pipeline","inference"]}],"abstract":"It has been a new research hot topic to speed up the inference process of deep neural networks (DNNs) by hardware accelerators based on field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs). Because of the layer-wise structure and data dependency between layers, previous studies commonly focus on the inherent parallelism of a single layer to reduce the computation time but neglect the parallelism between layers. In this paper, we propose a pipeline energy-efficient accelerator named PIE to accelerate the DNN inference computation by pipelining two adjacent layers. Through realizing two adjacent layers in different calculation orders, the data dependency between layers can be weakened. As soon as a layer produces an output, the next layer reads the output as an input and starts the parallel computation immediately in another calculation method. In such a way, computations between adjacent layers are pipelined. We conduct our experiments on a Zedboard development kit using Xilinx Zynq-7000 FPGA, compared with Intel Core i7 4.0GHz CPU and NVIDIA K40C GPU. Experimental results indicate that PIE is 4.82x faster than CPU and can reduce the energy consumptions of CPU and GPU by 355.35x and 12.02x respectively. Besides, compared with the none-pipelined method that layers are processed in serial, PIE improves the performance by nearly 50%.","doi":"10.1109/ICPADS.2016.0141","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE 22nd International Conference on Parallel and Distributed Systems (ICPADS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE 22nd International Conference on Parallel and Distributed Systems (ICPADS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7822825/7823715/07823856.pdf","startPage":"1067","endPage":"1074","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICPADS.2016.0141","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7823715","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7823856","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"PIE: A Pipeline Energy-Efficient Accelerator for Inference Process in Deep Neural Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Dec. 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7823856/","displayDocTitle":"PIE: A Pipeline Energy-Efficient Accelerator for Inference Process in Deep Neural Networks","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7823856/","publicationDate":"Dec. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2017","conferenceDate":"13-16 Dec. 2016","accessionNumber":"16617890","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"PIE: A Pipeline Energy-Efficient Accelerator for Inference Process in Deep Neural Networks","confLoc":"Wuhan, China","sourcePdf":"4457b067.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.084342S","chronDate":"13-16 Dec. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7822825","isNumber":"7823715","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7822825","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7823715","articleId":"7823856","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7823870,"authors":[{"name":"Jixin Zhang","affiliation":["College of Computer Science and Electronic Engineering, Hunan University, Hunan, China","Hunan Key Laboratory of Big Data Research and Application, Hunan, China"],"firstName":"Jixin","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37085860762"},{"name":"Zheng Qin","affiliation":["College of Computer Science and Electronic Engineering, Hunan University, Hunan, China","Hunan Key Laboratory of Big Data Research and Application, Hunan, China"],"firstName":"Zheng","lastName":"Qin","id":"37594217000"},{"name":"Hui Yin","affiliation":["College of Computer Science and Electronic Engineering, Hunan University, Hunan, China","Hunan Key Laboratory of Big Data Research and Application, Hunan, China"],"firstName":"Hui","lastName":"Yin","id":"37085853237"},{"name":"Lu Ou","affiliation":["College of Computer Science and Electronic Engineering, Hunan University, Hunan, China","Hunan Key Laboratory of Big Data Research and Application, Hunan, China"],"firstName":"Lu","lastName":"Ou","id":"37085853906"},{"name":"Yupeng Hu","affiliation":["College of Computer Science and Electronic Engineering, Hunan University, Hunan, China","Hunan Key Laboratory of Big Data Research and Application, Hunan, China"],"firstName":"Yupeng","lastName":"Hu","id":"37085858794"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4457-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-5382-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1521-9097"}],"articleNumber":"7823870","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":18,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":560},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"IRMD: Malware Variant Detection Using Opcode Image Recognition","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE 22nd International Conference on Parallel and Distributed Systems (ICPADS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7822825/7823715/07823870.pdf","startPage":"1175","endPage":"1180","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE 22nd International Conference on Parallel and Distributed Systems (ICPADS)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICPADS.2016.0155","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7823715","doi":"10.1109/ICPADS.2016.0155","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Malware","Image recognition","Training","Feature extraction","Image reconstruction","Histograms","Neural networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feature extraction","feedforward neural nets","image coding","image recognition","image sequences","invasive software"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["IRMD","malware variant detection","opcode image recognition","personal computers","industrial control systems","antidetection mechanisms","code-morphism","code feature based detection systems","opcode sequences","convolutional neural network","binary targets","malware sample codes","visualized analysis"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Convolutional neural network","Malware detection","Opcode images","Visualized analysis"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7823870","abstract":"Malware detection becomes mission critical as its threats spread from personal computers to industrial control systems.

In this study, we show that pixel-wise combination is sub-optimal and successful fusion needs to model dependencies between neighboring pixels and exploit the content of the tampered image. We evaluate two methods based on conditional random fields and demonstrate that they can exploit image content and precisely delineate the shape of the forgery. In contrast to existing methods based on explicit image segmentation, such an approach does not suffer from subtle object removal forgeries where meaningful segments do not exist. We also demonstrate that existing performance measures are insufficient to accurately assess tampering localization performance. Further work in this direction is needed.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Detectors","Forensics","Forgery","Correlation","Shape","Reliability","Feature extraction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image segmentation","random processes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["random field models","forensic detectors","forensic features","unsupervised multimodal tampering localization performance","input tampering maps","conditional random fields","forgery","image segmentation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["digital image forensics","content forgery","tampering localization","decision fusion","random field models","photo-response non-uniformity","color-filter array"]}],"doi":"10.1109/WIFS.2016.7823898","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE International Workshop on Information Forensics and Security (WIFS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE International Workshop on Information Forensics and Security (WIFS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7811906/7823570/07823898.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7823570","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WIFS.2016.7823898","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Evaluation of random field models in multi-modal unsupervised tampering localization","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7823898","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Evaluation of random field models in multi-modal unsupervised tampering localization","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7823898/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7823898/","accessionNumber":"16616952","conferenceDate":"4-7 Dec. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-7 Dec. 2016","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Evaluation of random field models in multi-modal unsupervised tampering localization","confLoc":"Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates","sourcePdf":"WIFS16paper20.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059517S","chronDate":"4-7 Dec. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7811906","isNumber":"7823570","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7811906","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"7823570","articleId":"7823898","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":7823902,"authors":[{"name":"Mauro Barni","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering and Mathematics, University of Siena, Siena, Italy"],"firstName":"Mauro","lastName":"Barni","id":"37267303900"},{"name":"Zhipeng Chen","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Tangshan Normal University, Tangshan, China","Institute of Information Science, Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Zhipeng","lastName":"Chen","id":"37076356900"},{"name":"Benedetta Tondi","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering and Mathematics, University of Siena, Siena, Italy"],"firstName":"Benedetta","lastName":"Tondi","id":"38548597400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1138-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1139-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2157-4774"}],"articleNumber":"7823902","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":13,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":346},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Detectors","Forensics","Distortion","Histograms","Discrete cosine transforms","Transform coding","Image coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data compression","discrete cosine transforms","image coding","image forensics","statistics","support vector machines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data-driven detection","double JPEG compression","adversary-aware SVM-based forensic detection","universal counter-forensic attack","universal C-F attack","block-DCT coefficient first order statistics","adversary-aware double JPEG detector"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7823902","doi":"10.1109/WIFS.2016.7823902","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WIFS.2016.7823902","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7823570","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE International Workshop on Information Forensics and Security (WIFS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE International Workshop on Information Forensics and Security (WIFS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7811906/7823570/07823902.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adversary-aware, data-driven detection of double JPEG compression: How to make counter-forensics harder","abstract":"In the attempt to investigate the final race of arms between the forensic analyst and the adversary in practical scenarios based on data-driven approaches, we introduce the idea of adversary-aware SVM-based forensic detection. By focusing on the problem of double JPEG compression, we first propose an improved universal counter-forensic (C-F) attack which works against any forensic detector based on the first order statistics of block-DCT coefficients and show its good performance against three different forensic detectors. Forensic detectors are commonly designed to distinguish between the absence and the presence of a given processing in a non-adversarial environment. We emphasize how such an evaluation methodology is unfair as, in order to test the real effectiveness of an attack, the forensic detector should take into account the possible presence of the attack. Accordingly, we propose an adversary-aware double JPEG detector which is trained to recognize the universal C-F attack. Experimental results confirm that the adversary-aware detector yields good performance thus suggesting that developing an effective counter-forensic attack is much harder than one could expect.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7823902/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-7 Dec. 2016","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"4-7 Dec. 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7823902/","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2017","publicationDate":"Dec. 2016","accessionNumber":"16616938","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Adversary-aware, data-driven detection of double JPEG compression: How to make counter-forensics harder","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adversary-aware, data-driven detection of double JPEG compression: How to make counter-forensics harder","confLoc":"Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates","sourcePdf":"WIFS16paper37.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.08304S","chronDate":"4-7 Dec. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7811906","isNumber":"7823570","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7811906","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"7823570","articleId":"7823902","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":7823905,"authors":[{"name":"Patrick Bas","affiliation":["CNRS, Univ.

The proposed CNN is specifically designed for image splicing and copy-move detection applications. Rather than a random strategy, the weights at the first layer of our network are initialized with the basic high-pass filter set used in calculation of residual maps in spatial rich model (SRM), which serves as a regularizer to efficiently suppress the effect of image contents and capture the subtle artifacts introduced by the tampering operations. The pre-trained CNN is used as patch descriptor to extract dense features from the test images, and a feature fusion technique is then explored to obtain the final discriminative features for SVM classification. The experimental results on several public datasets show that the proposed CNN based model outperforms some state-of-the-art methods.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A deep learning approach to detection of splicing and copy-move forgeries in images","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE International Workshop on Information Forensics and Security (WIFS)","doi":"10.1109/WIFS.2016.7823911","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE International Workshop on Information Forensics and Security (WIFS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7811906/7823570/07823911.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WIFS.2016.7823911","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7823570","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7823911","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7823911/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-7 Dec. 2016","displayDocTitle":"A deep learning approach to detection of splicing and copy-move forgeries in images","conferenceDate":"4-7 Dec. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7823911/","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2017","publicationDate":"Dec. 2016","accessionNumber":"16616950","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A deep learning approach to detection of splicing and copy-move forgeries in images","confLoc":"Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates","sourcePdf":"WIFS16paper57.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046393S","chronDate":"4-7 Dec. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7811906","isNumber":"7823570","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7811906","citationCount":"132","xplore-issue":"7823570","articleId":"7823911","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7823921,"authors":[{"name":"Davide Cozzolino","affiliation":["DIETI, University Federico II of Naples, Italy"],"firstName":"Davide","lastName":"Cozzolino","id":"37085468576"},{"name":"Luisa Verdoliva","affiliation":["DIETI, University Federico II of Naples, Italy"],"firstName":"Luisa","lastName":"Verdoliva","id":"37283465400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1138-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1139-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2157-4774"}],"articleNumber":"7823921","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":34,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1938},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Feature extraction","Splicing","Image reconstruction","Training","Forgery","Cameras","Data models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feature extraction","image coding","iterative methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["single-image splicing localization","expressive local feature extraction","noise residual","autoencoder-based anomaly detection","discriminative feature labeling","discriminative feature autoencoding","spliced region recognition","social net post-processing"]}],"abstract":"We propose a new method for single-image splicing localization. Lacking any side information, such as training data or prior knowledge on the source camera and the image history, we cast the problem as an anomaly detection task.

By iterating discriminative feature labeling and autoencoding, the implicit model fits eventually the pristine data, while the spliced region is recognized as anomalous. Experiments on a suitable test set of spliced images show that the proposed method outperforms the previous state-of-the-art.

Search engines crawl the web every now and then to build web graphs which store information about the structure of the web. This is an expensive and error prone process. Central to this problem is the notion of graph similarity (between two graphs spaced in time), which validates how well search engines secure content from web and the quality of the search results they produce. In this paper, we propose two different types of anomalies which occur during crawling and two novel similarity measures based on vertex neighbourhood, which overcomes the proposed anomalies.

Though community detection in networks is a very active research area, most of the algorithms focus on homogenous networks. Homogeneous networks consist of only one type of nodes and one type of edges. However, real-world networks mostly exhibit multi-typed objects and relationships thus forming heterogeneous information networks. There have been only a few studies in the past which aim at revealing the hidden communities in heterogeneous information networks. In this paper, we propose an effective community detection algorithm based on incremental seed expansion mechanism. Our algorithm utilizes the concept of weighted path matrix and transforms the network from heterogeneous to a homogenous network. The central idea behind our algorithm is to identify good seeds and then iteratively expand them such that the conductance score of detected communities is minimized. Experiment on a real-world network establish the viability of proposed approach.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICDSE.2016.7823964","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7823929","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 International Conference on Data Science and Engineering (ICDSE)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7807432/7823929/07823964.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Community detection in heterogenous networks using incremental seed expansion","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7823964/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-25 Aug. 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7823964/","displayDocTitle":"Community detection in heterogenous networks using incremental seed expansion","conferenceDate":"23-25 Aug. 2016","publicationDate":"Aug. 2016","accessionNumber":"16603676","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Community detection in heterogenous networks using incremental seed expansion","confLoc":"Cochin, India","sourcePdf":"PID4438925.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.093813S","chronDate":"23-25 Aug. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7807432","isNumber":"7823929","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7807432","xplore-issue":"7823929","articleId":"7823964","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7823969,"authors":[{"name":"Indu Singh","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Delhi Technological University, Delhi, India"],"firstName":"Indu","lastName":"Singh","id":"37085892887"},{"name":"Karan Sanwal","affiliation":["Computer Science and Engineering Delhi Technological University, Delhi, India"],"firstName":"Karan","lastName":"Sanwal","id":"37086026024"},{"name":"Satyarth Praveen","affiliation":["Computer Science and Engineering Delhi Technological University, Delhi, India"],"firstName":"Satyarth","lastName":"Praveen","id":"37086025396"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1281-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1282-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7823969","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":308},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Artificial neural networks","Breast cancer","Genetic algorithms","Biological neural networks","Tumors","Classification algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cancer","genetic algorithms","medical computing","neural nets","pattern classification","tumours"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["breast cancer detection","breast cancer tumor classification","two-fold genetic evolution","neural network ensemble","intergenetic algorithm","intragenetic algorithm","artificial neural network"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Breast cancer detection","Genetic Algorithms","Artificial Neural Networks","Neural Network Ensembles"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7823969","abstract":"Breast cancer is the development of a malignant tumor notably in the breasts of a female.

Existing PCGC with single encoder has not been extensively successful due to its performance limitation, decoder complexity and decoding delay.

FBMC system is one among the strong contenders for 5G implementations. While better designs of FBMC systems are evolving with time, it is imperative that the hardware complexity is not overlooked. It is important that filter bank designs with reduced computational resources are sought. Reducing computational complexity offers advantages like less power consumption, faster computations and reduced runtime resources. These advantages have more significance in 5G where ultra high speed and ultra low latency are the highlights. Filter bank designs using fast convolution employ less arithmetic resources compared to polyphase filter bank implementations. The fast convolution filter design makes use of only filter's frequency domain sample values for filtering since the filtering is restricted to frequency domain. So the conventional polyphase implementation of filter is completely done away with. In this paper, we present FBMC/OQAM system using Fast Convolution and the performance of the system is evaluated in a communication channel. The system is compared with conventional polyphase FBMC/OQAM system and it is found that fast convolution based system outperforms polyphase implementation of FBMC system in computational complexity and BER performance.","doi":"10.1109/CSN.2016.7823988","publicationTitle":"2016 International Conference on Communication Systems and Networks (ComNet)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 International Conference on Communication Systems and Networks (ComNet)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7807442/7823972/07823988.pdf","startPage":"65","endPage":"70","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CSN.2016.7823988","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7823972","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance analysis of fast convolution based FBMC-OQAM system","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7823988","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-23 July 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7823988/","displayDocTitle":"Performance analysis of fast convolution based FBMC-OQAM system","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2016","accessionNumber":"16603719","htmlLink":"/document/7823988/","conferenceDate":"21-23 July 2016","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance analysis of fast convolution based FBMC-OQAM system","confLoc":"Thiruvananthapuram, India","sourcePdf":"ComNet2016073.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056852S","chronDate":"21-23 July 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7807442","isNumber":"7823972","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7807442","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7823972","articleId":"7823988","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7823990,"authors":[{"name":"Neetha Mariam Jacob","affiliation":["Dept. of Electronics and Communication Engineering, Mar Baselios College of Engineering and Technology, Thiruvananthapuram, India"],"firstName":"Neetha Mariam","lastName":"Jacob","id":"37086119658"},{"name":"Luxy Mathews","affiliation":["Dept. of Electronics and Communication Engineering, Mar Baselios College of Engineering and Technology, Thiruvananthapuram, India"],"firstName":"Luxy","lastName":"Mathews","id":"37085513175"},{"name":"Sakuntala S.

High resolution algorithms for DOA estimation have been widely used in applications like SONAR, RADAR and wireless communications to resolve closely-situated sources. However these algorithms are very sensitive to the signal to noise ratio (SNR), the number of snapshots and correlation between sources. The DOA estimation problem can be viewed as a sparse representation problem as the signals impinging on an array are intrinsically sparse in the spatial domain. Hence compressed sensing techniques can be applied in DOA estimation. This paper explores the formulation of the DOA estimation as a sparse representation problem and compares the performance of different compressive beamforming techniques. Compressive beamforming is done using 11 minimization and greedy algorithms. It is shown that greedy algorithms are faster than 11 minimization. An improvement to greedy algorithm is proposed in this paper so that prior information about sparsity is not needed. Resolution is further improved using multiband signals. Thus the study shows that compressive beamforming can give 2 to 3 degree resolution from single snapshot which is better than existing methods.","doi":"10.1109/CSN.2016.7823991","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 International Conference on Communication Systems and Networks (ComNet)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7807442/7823972/07823991.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7823972","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CSN.2016.7823991","publicationTitle":"2016 International Conference on Communication Systems and Networks (ComNet)","startPage":"81","endPage":"86","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Compressive beamforming using greedy algorithms","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7823991","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-23 July 2016","displayDocTitle":"Compressive beamforming using greedy algorithms","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7823991/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7823991/","publicationDate":"July 2016","accessionNumber":"16603698","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2017","conferenceDate":"21-23 July 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Compressive beamforming using greedy algorithms","confLoc":"Thiruvananthapuram, India","sourcePdf":"ComNet2016078.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062278S","chronDate":"21-23 July 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7807442","isNumber":"7823972","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7807442","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7823972","articleId":"7823991","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":7823992,"authors":[{"name":"K A Arun Kumar","affiliation":["Centre for Development of Advanced Computing, Trivandrum, India"],"firstName":"K A Arun","lastName":"Kumar","id":"37085935255"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3349-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-5090-3348-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3350-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7823992","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":303},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7823992","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Mathematical model","Computational modeling","Modulation","Feature extraction","Field programmable gate arrays","Software packages","Standards"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive modulation","amplitude shift keying","cognitive radio","decision theory","fast Fourier transforms","field programmable gate arrays","frequency shift keying","higher order statistics","microprocessor chips","neural nets","pattern classification","phase shift keying","quadrature amplitude modulation","radio spectrum management","signal detection","software radio","system-on-chip","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FM signals","spectral power density","MFSK signal identification","MASK signal identification","zero centered instantaneous phase","8PSK signals","QPSK signals","BPSK signals","64-QAM signals","32-QAM signals","16-QAM signals","SNR based higher order cumulant computation","neural network algorithms","FFT","dual core ARM processor","Artix-7 FPGA","adaptive modulation recognition system","Zynq implementation","decision theoretic approach","pattern recognition","SDR configuration","spectrum hole identification","intelligent software defined radios","modulation classification module","cognitive radios","SoC implementation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Zynq","FPGA","RTL","Cumulants","FFT","Cognitive Radio","SDR"]}],"abstract":"The Cognitive radios are intelligent Software Defined radios which is aware of its environment by scanning and identifying spectrum holes.

Melanoma skin cancers are also known as malignant melanoma. Recent studies show that the death rates of melanoma patients depend on the various stages of cancer, so early detection and treatment of melanoma implicate higher chances of cure. Now most of the existing skin lesion analysis system use ABCDE parameters for feature extraction. But these methods have lot of drawbacks. In this paper an advance earlier melanoma detection algorithm is proposed using colour correlogram and texture analysis. Bayesian classifier is used to detect the abnormal skin cells with colour correlogram and SFTA feature vectors.

Owing to this new architecture, there exist some defects which require additional testing techniques. The defect in these biochips is studied by analyzing the capacitance changes at the sensing circuit. An investigation of capacitance of droplet based on the volume variation is done. The motivation behind this study is to see the variation of capacitance due to the defects in the biochips which can occur due to the volume variation of the droplet in MEDA based biochips. It is seen that the capacitance of droplet varies linearly with droplet volume which leads to the conclusion that defects due to the volume variation directly affects the capacitance at the sensing

processing (JP) is a powerful mechanism in alleviating inter-cell interference (ICI) and maximizing data rate of cell-edge users. However, JP puts tremendous load on both feedback and backhaul overhead, thus partial JP was proposed to overcome high overhead signaling. Unlike linear techniques such as zero-forcing (ZF), achieving an equivalent backhaul reduction and presenting a totally free ICI system based on limited feedback channel state information can be done by designing and implementing a multi-start particle swarm optimization algorithm (MSPSOA) as a beamforming (BF) mechanism. The performance of the proposed MSPSOA and ZF BF is evaluated based on the acquired spectral efficiency and utility of internet application such as hard real-time, adaptive and elastic applications. The simulation results shows that, the proposed MSPSOA BF achieves spectral efficiency up to 69.5% compared to ZF BF, and it maintains total utility for high data rate requirements of three common internet traffic such as hard real-time, adaptive and elastic applications.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7824093/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-17 Aug. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2017","accessionNumber":"16603779","htmlLink":"/document/7824093/","conferenceDate":"15-17 Aug. 2016","displayDocTitle":"Internet utility evaluation of a multi-start particle swarm optimization beamformer in a partial joint processing cellular network","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Internet utility evaluation of a multi-start particle swarm optimization beamformer in a partial joint processing cellular network","confLoc":"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"1570249983.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050654S","chronDate":"15-17 Aug. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7807758","isNumber":"7824023","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7807758","xplore-issue":"7824023","articleId":"7824093","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7824101,"authors":[{"name":"Abid M.

Such wearable sensors may be used for early detection of abnormal conditions for preventive actions in monitoring individual health. However, it is challenging to estimate heart rates using PPG signals with high accuracy due to the irregular motion artifacts, thus making the estimation of heart rate unreliable. In this paper, we proposed the use of Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) followed by Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) for noise reduction of the PPG signals. We calculated the heart beat rate per minute (BPM) from the reconstructed PPG signals and evaluated the performance of the proposed method in terms of Absolute Maximum Error (AME) and Mean Sum Error (MSE) with the provided ground-truth BPM computed from ECG signals. We have shown an improvement in the MSE values from 67% of the datasets used in this study. We also analyzed the relationship between the performances obtained based the level of movement intensity which are measured using the accelerometer.","doi":"10.1109/ICIAS.2016.7824118","publicationTitle":"2016 6th International Conference on Intelligent and Advanced Systems (ICIAS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 6th International Conference on Intelligent and Advanced Systems (ICIAS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7807758/7824023/07824118.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIAS.2016.7824118","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7824023","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"PPG signal reconstruction using a combination of discrete wavelet transform and empirical mode decomposition","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7824118","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-17 Aug. 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7824118/","displayDocTitle":"PPG signal reconstruction using a combination of discrete wavelet transform and empirical mode decomposition","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2016","accessionNumber":"16603791","htmlLink":"/document/7824118/","conferenceDate":"15-17 Aug. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"PPG signal reconstruction using a combination of discrete wavelet transform and empirical mode decomposition","confLoc":"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"1570256900.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047028S","chronDate":"15-17 Aug. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7807758","isNumber":"7824023","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7807758","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"7824023","articleId":"7824118","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7824120,"authors":[{"name":"Lim Yong Hooi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Universiti Teknologi PETRONAS, Perak, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Lim Yong","lastName":"Hooi","id":"37086085041"},{"name":"Lo Hai Hiung","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Universiti Teknologi PETRONAS, Perak, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Lo Hai","lastName":"Hiung","id":"37857657000"},{"name":"Micheal Drieberg","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Universiti Teknologi PETRONAS, Perak, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Micheal","lastName":"Drieberg","id":"37392080700"},{"name":"Patrick Sebastian","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Universiti Teknologi PETRONAS, Perak, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Patrick","lastName":"Sebastian","id":"37580755800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-0845-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-0846-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7824120","dbTime":"31 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":267},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Configurable 2 bits per cycle successive approximation register for analog to digital converter on FPGA","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7824120","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Field programmable gate arrays","Clocks","Registers","Application specific integrated circuits","Prototypes","Production","Cyclones"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["analogue-digital conversion","comparators (circuits)","field programmable gate arrays","flip-flops","integrated circuit design"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["successive approximation register","analog to digital converter","SAR ADC","medium-to-high resolution","comparators","Altera DE2 board","field programmable gate arrays","Cyclone II FPGA","frequency 50 MHz","frequency 136 MHz"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Successive approximation","binary search","analog","digital","ADC"]}],"abstract":"Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC) technology has been advancing to achieve a balance between speeds, size and cost. Successive approximation register (SAR) ADC is very popular for medium-to-high resolution as it is small but has difficulties in achieving high speed while flash ADC is big and not cost effective. Also, for different purposes, ADC have different resolution requirement. Producing ADCs with different resolution increases cost if it is not used in large scale production. In this paper, we propose to solve the issues of speed, size and cost by presenting a configurable 2 bits per cycle successive approximation register (SAR) ADC for FPGA implementation based on modification from successive approximation method. This SAR utilizes three comparators, instead of one comparator in normal SAR ADC. This enables the SAR to convert 2 bits at a time hence, reducing the conversion time by half, while at the same time, the resolution of this presented SAR is configurable. This increases the reusability of this SAR ADC for various different requirements of resolution. The design is implemented on Altera DE2 board with Cyclone II FPGA at a clock rate of 50MHz and can be boosted to 136MHz. On average, N cycles is needed for 2N bit resolution.","doi":"10.1109/ICIAS.2016.7824120","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIAS.2016.7824120","publicationTitle":"2016 6th International Conference on Intelligent and Advanced Systems (ICIAS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 6th International Conference on Intelligent and Advanced Systems (ICIAS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7807758/7824023/07824120.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7824023","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7824120/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-17 Aug. 2016","displayDocTitle":"Configurable 2 bits per cycle successive approximation register for analog to digital converter on FPGA","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"15-17 Aug. 2016","accessionNumber":"16603748","htmlLink":"/document/7824120/","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2017","publicationDate":"Aug. 2016","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Configurable 2 bits per cycle successive approximation register for analog to digital converter on FPGA","confLoc":"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"1570257208.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061457S","chronDate":"15-17 Aug. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7807758","isNumber":"7824023","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7807758","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7824023","articleId":"7824120","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7824122,"authors":[{"name":"Ahmad Kamal Hassan","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, King Abdulaziz University, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia"],"firstName":"Ahmad Kamal","lastName":"Hassan","id":"37086084050"},{"name":"Muhammad Moinuddin","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, King Abdulaziz University, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia"],"firstName":"Muhammad","lastName":"Moinuddin","id":"37594078200"},{"name":"Ubaid M.

Currently long-range, high-speed backhaul communication over sea is limited to line-of-sight (LOS) distances requiring high antenna towers for microwave radio link or satellite based backhaul link which is limited in bandwidth. Using evaporation duct, present over Malaysian water in South China Sea surface to our advantage, we can achieve results for a long-range, non-line-of-sight (NLOS) maritime wireless backhaul high-speed communication link. With high reliability and capacity this could be the best alternative for long-range, high-speed maritime communication. Virtual MIMO based Mesh Network can further increase availability and capacity performance for a NLOS broadband maritime wireless communication Network.","doi":"10.1109/ICIAS.2016.7824129","publicationTitle":"2016 6th International Conference on Intelligent and Advanced Systems (ICIAS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 6th International Conference on Intelligent and Advanced Systems (ICIAS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7807758/7824023/07824129.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIAS.2016.7824129","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7824023","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High reliability using virtual MIMO based mesh network for maritime wireless communication","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7824129","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-17 Aug. 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7824129/","displayDocTitle":"High reliability using virtual MIMO based mesh network for maritime wireless communication","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2016","accessionNumber":"16603759","htmlLink":"/document/7824129/","conferenceDate":"15-17 Aug. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High reliability using virtual MIMO based mesh network for maritime wireless communication","confLoc":"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"1570258583.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061945S","chronDate":"15-17 Aug. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7807758","isNumber":"7824023","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7807758","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7824023","articleId":"7824129","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7824137,"authors":[{"name":"M.

The main idea of the design is based on minimizing the steady-state error to reach the limit dictated by the Cramer-Rao Lower Bound (CRLB) of the implicit estimation process. By using the proposed method, optimum error nonlinearity is devised for long adaptive filters without employing any assumption on the distribution input regressor constituents and on the noise distribution, independence input regressor assumption and any kind of linearization. Moreover, to implement the proposed design, two different methods for estimating the variance of a priori estimation error are developed. Furthermore, an intelligent switching mechanism is also introduced to efficiently utilize the designed optimum error non-linearity for the impulsive noise. The theoretical results are testify through simulations, to show the superiority of the designed optimum error nonlinearity.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIAS.2016.7824137","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7824023","publicationTitle":"2016 6th International Conference on Intelligent and Advanced Systems (ICIAS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 6th International Conference on Intelligent and Advanced Systems (ICIAS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7807758/7824023/07824137.pdf","endPage":"6","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design of optimum error nonlinearity for channel estimation in the presence of class-A impulsive noise","doi":"10.1109/ICIAS.2016.7824137","startPage":"1","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7824137","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-17 Aug. 2016","displayDocTitle":"Design of optimum error nonlinearity for channel estimation in the presence of class-A impulsive noise","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7824137/","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2017","accessionNumber":"16616388","publicationDate":"Aug. 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7824137/","conferenceDate":"15-17 Aug. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design of optimum error nonlinearity for channel estimation in the presence of class-A impulsive noise","confLoc":"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"1570258969.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069787S","chronDate":"15-17 Aug. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7807758","isNumber":"7824023","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7807758","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"7824023","articleId":"7824137","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7824144,"authors":[{"name":"S.M.

This time can be reduced considerably with HLL approach. The presented algorithm is designed on a HLL tool, namely Xilinx system generator. It is very user friendly despite giving detailed control in designing the required system design. For actual testing and hardware implementation of the algorithm, the HLL-tool generates a bit file that can be directly burnt on the FPGA. To get the implementation of design on hardware, the presented work uses a similar approach to directly map the System Generator described design on FPGA. The presented work emphasizes on optimization for less hardware utilization. The presented design uses approximately just one thousand slices and about half a century of BRAMs. The frequency at which the hardware can work is about 254.453 MHz.

In this paper, we extend power consumption models for MaMi systems by evaluating different options such as precoder types, revisiting digital complexity estimates of different components, and incorporating the impact of improved designs, e.g., future analog RF frontends.

For the system analysis, digital signal processing is abstracted to minimum SNR requirement definitions and RF system SNR is described based on realistic but highly simplified transmitter and receiver performance related to output and input power levels, respectively. In addition, a simple link adaptation model is created for dynamic simulation tasks. As the contribution of antenna array is seen to become necessity in cm- and mm-wave bands for 5G systems, we show ways to include antenna modelling in system analysis. By using these analysis methods, we have generated a link level simulator that can be used for system analysis using different abstractions of antennas. Finally, it is shown that even simple RF models need to have certain implementation related details in order to provide good accuracy in link budget and operation range analysis.","doi":"10.1109/EuMC.2016.7824298","publicationTitle":"2016 46th European Microwave Conference (EuMC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 46th European Microwave Conference (EuMC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7805383/7824247/07824298.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EuMC.2016.7824298","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7824247","startPage":"142","endPage":"45","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"RF system requirement analysis and simulation methods towards 5G radios using massive MIMO","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7824298","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"RF system requirement analysis and simulation methods towards 5G radios using massive MIMO","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-6 Oct. 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7824298/","conferenceDate":"4-6 Oct. 2016","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2016","accessionNumber":"16603393","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7824298/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"RF system requirement analysis and simulation methods towards 5G radios using massive MIMO","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1047.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056337S","chronDate":"4-6 Oct. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7805383","isNumber":"7824247","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7805383","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"7824247","articleId":"7824298","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"European Microwave Association","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7824299,"authors":[{"name":"Yushi Shirato","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Tokyo University of Science, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Yushi","lastName":"Shirato","id":"37330511500"},{"name":"Masahiro Muraguchi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Tokyo University of Science, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Masahiro","lastName":"Muraguchi","id":"37266232400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-2-87487-043-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1514-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7824299","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":79},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Signal to noise ratio","Signal resolution","Receivers","Transmitters","Peak to average power ratio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["error statistics","MIMO communication","OFDM modulation","transmitters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["signal decomposition technique","OFDM transmitters","MIMO systems","mobile terminals","simple noise elimination techniques","constant amplitude on-off-signals","CCDF","complementary cumulative distribution function","SNR"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Power Added Efficiency","Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing","Power Amplifier","Multiple Input Multiple Output"]}],"abstract":"The authors have proposed the signal decomposition technique as one of the powerful solution to mitigate the large PAPR to be addressed in OFDM transmitters especially on mobile terminals.

The FBMC ability to bear notches in the spectrum is confirmed, in spite of the PA, and improvement with respect to OFDM measured.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Nonlinear distortion","Receivers","Prototypes","Interference","Cognitive radio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["5G mobile communication","channel bank filters","cognitive radio","OFDM modulation","radiofrequency power amplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["RF front-end","cognitive radio","5G communications","OFDM","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","power amplifier nonlinearities","FBMC","filter bank multicarrier signals"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cognitive Radio","FBMC","Nonlinearities","Power Amplifier","OFDM","Spectral Agility","Spectral Containment"]}],"doi":"10.1109/EuMC.2016.7824300","publicationTitle":"2016 46th European Microwave Conference (EuMC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 46th European Microwave Conference (EuMC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7805383/7824247/07824300.pdf","startPage":"150","endPage":"153","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7824247","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EuMC.2016.7824300","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robustness of filter bank multicarrier signals to power amplifier nonlinearities","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7824300","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Robustness of filter bank multicarrier signals to power amplifier nonlinearities","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7824300/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7824300/","accessionNumber":"16616331","conferenceDate":"4-6 Oct. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-6 Oct. 2016","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robustness of filter bank multicarrier signals to power amplifier nonlinearities","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1523.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042169S","chronDate":"4-6 Oct. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7805383","isNumber":"7824247","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7805383","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7824247","articleId":"7824300","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"European Microwave Association","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":7824301,"authors":[{"name":"Eisaku Sasaki","affiliation":["Mobile Wireless Solutions Division, NEC Corporation, Kawasaki, Japan"],"firstName":"Eisaku","lastName":"Sasaki","id":"38492854500"},{"name":"Masashi Hirabe","affiliation":["Mobile Wireless Solutions Division, NEC Corporation, Kawasaki, Japan"],"firstName":"Masashi","lastName":"Hirabe","id":"37086001369"},{"name":"Tsuguo Maru","affiliation":["NEC Corporation, Cloud System Research Laboratories, Kawasaki, Japan"],"firstName":"Tsuguo","lastName":"Maru","id":"37926854300"},{"name":"Nader Zein","affiliation":["NEC Europe Ltd Athene, Odyssey Business Park, UK"],"firstName":"Nader","lastName":"Zein","id":"37086001223"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-2-87487-043-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1514-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7824301","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":659},"abstract":"A new orbital angular momentum (OAM) mode and polarization multiplexing transmission system in the millimeter-wave range is proposed for future Ultra high capacity backhaul/fronthaul radio. Our theoretical analysis reveals that all the OAM modes can be used with polarization transmission while maintaining high degree of orthogonality. Furthermore, we show that links in the order of 100m can be achieved using the OAM lower-order modes in the millimeter-wave bands. A combination of an antenna array and a Butler matrix can encode and decode multiple OAM modes. We achieved 7-m transmission with two-modes multiplexing with a prototype of our system at 5.2 GHz. This translates to over 100m when applied to the mmwave bands. The experimental results agree well with the theoretical analysis, and are verifies our estimation of available link distance.","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 46th European Microwave Conference (EuMC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7805383/7824247/07824301.pdf","startPage":"154","endPage":"157","publicationTitle":"2016 46th European Microwave Conference (EuMC)","doi":"10.1109/EuMC.2016.7824301","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EuMC.2016.7824301","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7824247","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7824301","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Pragmatic OAM with polarization multiplexing transmission for future 5G ultra-high capacity radio","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multiplexing","Butler matrices","Antenna measurements","5G mobile communication","Receiving antennas","Transmitting antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["5G mobile communication","antenna arrays","mobile antennas","multiplexing","quadrature amplitude modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiplexing","decode multiple OAM modes","antenna array","Butler matrix","millimeter-wave bands","polarization transmission","ultra high capacity backhaul/fronthaul radio","millimeter-wave range","polarization multiplexing transmission system","OAM mode","orbital angular momentum","5G ultra-high capacity radio","pragmatic OAM"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Orbital Angular Momentum (OAM)","mode-multiplexing","millimeter-wave","antenna array","link distance"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7824301/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-6 Oct. 2016","displayDocTitle":"Pragmatic OAM with polarization multiplexing transmission for future 5G ultra-high capacity radio","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7824301/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2016","accessionNumber":"16603396","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2017","conferenceDate":"4-6 Oct. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Pragmatic OAM with polarization multiplexing transmission for future 5G ultra-high capacity radio","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1308.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.168628S","chronDate":"4-6 Oct. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7805383","isNumber":"7824247","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7805383","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"7824247","articleId":"7824301","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"European Microwave Association","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7824308,"authors":[{"name":"Pere L.

Specifically, while the reflective filter provides the required input-to-output rejection of the harmonics, the absorptive filter provides the required matching, thus preventing the harmonics from being reflected at the input port.

Dielectrophoresis (DEP) is a well-established technique used in the kHz frequency range to manipulate, trap and sort electrically polarized cells by exposing them to a non-uniform electric field. The novelty of this work consists in exploring the capability of UHF signals to manipulate, trap and discriminate cells based on their intracellular dielectric properties. Actually the study of their dielectrophoretic behavior in such frequency band appears a very attractive method for cell electrical characterization and further label free sorting purpose. As proof of concept, we demonstrate here the contact less UHF-DEP handling of colon cancer cells flowing in microfluidic channel with frequencies above 100 MHz. The first reported results show the capability of the proposed device to identify the higher cross over frequencies of cells related to their own intracellular specificities.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"UHF dielectrophoretic handling of individual biological cells using BiCMOS microfluidic RF-sensors","publicationTitle":"2016 46th European Microwave Conference (EuMC)","doi":"10.1109/EuMC.2016.7824329","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 46th European Microwave Conference (EuMC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7805383/7824247/07824329.pdf","startPage":"265","endPage":"268","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EuMC.2016.7824329","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7824247","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7824329","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7824329/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-6 Oct. 2016","displayDocTitle":"UHF dielectrophoretic handling of individual biological cells using BiCMOS microfluidic RF-sensors","conferenceDate":"4-6 Oct. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7824329/","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2017","publicationDate":"Oct. 2016","accessionNumber":"16603563","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"UHF dielectrophoretic handling of individual biological cells using BiCMOS microfluidic RF-sensors","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1729.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069943S","chronDate":"4-6 Oct. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7805383","isNumber":"7824247","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7805383","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"7824247","articleId":"7824329","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"European Microwave Association","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7824339,"authors":[{"name":"A.

A dual-band FSS is then realised by adding smaller square loops within the existing lattice.

The chip features a fully differential frequency multiplier (\u00d730 or \u00d7 6) to realize a frequency-modulated continuous-wave radar with a binary phase-shift keying modulator in the transmit chain and a fully-differential IQ-receiver. The bare die is packaged in an embedded-wafer-level-ball-grid-array (eWLB) technology. The redistribution layer of the eWLB package is utilized to realize eight-element tapered rhombic transmit and receive antenna arrays. The packages are fabricated with and without backside metallization to demonstrate the effect on radiation pattern symmetry and sidelobe levels. On-wafer measurement results show a maximum transmit output power of 2.7 dBm and a 3-dB bandwidth of 17 GHz. The in-package TX/RX antennas provide a measured gain of 11 dBi which results in an effective isotropic radiated power of 13.7 dBm. The entire chip consumes a DC power of 540 mW at a supply voltage of 3.3 V.","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 46th European Microwave Conference (EuMC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7805383/7824247/07824435.pdf","startPage":"683","endPage":"686","publicationTitle":"2016 46th European Microwave Conference (EuMC)","doi":"10.1109/EuMC.2016.7824435","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EuMC.2016.7824435","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7824247","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7824435","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A 122-GHz system-in-package radar sensor with BPSK modulator in a 130-nm SiGe BiCMOS technology","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Antenna measurements","Gain","Frequency modulation","Radar","Gain measurement","Binary phase shift keying"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","antenna radiation patterns","ball grid arrays","BiCMOS integrated circuits","CW radar","FM radar","metallisation","phase shift keying","radar receivers","system-in-package","wafer level packaging"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["system-in-package radar sensor","BPSK modulator","BiCMOS technology","bistatic radar sensor","differential frequency multiplier","frequency-modulated continuous-wave radar","binary phase-shift keying modulator","fully-differential IQ-receiver","embedded-wafer-level-ball-grid-array technology","redistribution layer","eight-element tapered rhombic transmit and receive antenna arrays","backside metallization","radiation pattern symmetry","sidelobe levels","frequency 122 GHz","size 130 nm","bandwidth 17 GHz","power 540 mW","voltage 3.3 V"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Heterojunction bipolar transistor (HBT)","SiGe BiCMOS integrated circuits","millimeter-wave circuits","frequency-modulated continuous-wave (FMCW) radar"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7824435/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-6 Oct. 2016","displayDocTitle":"A 122-GHz system-in-package radar sensor with BPSK modulator in a 130-nm SiGe BiCMOS technology","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7824435/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2016","accessionNumber":"16603489","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2017","conferenceDate":"4-6 Oct. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A 122-GHz system-in-package radar sensor with BPSK modulator in a 130-nm SiGe BiCMOS technology","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1735.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04045S","chronDate":"4-6 Oct. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7805383","isNumber":"7824247","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7805383","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"7824247","articleId":"7824435","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"European Microwave Association","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7824443,"authors":[{"name":"P.

Highly linear analog frequency ramps are synthesized at high frequencies (8.4 GHz to 14 GHz), using a wideband voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO) stabilized by a fractional-N phase locked loop (PLL), and are mixed down to the desired frequency band using a second PLL-stabilized VCO at a constant frequency of 14.4 GHz. In order to achieve a wideband PLL-stabilization, the loop gain variation is reduced by inserting a voltage dependent damping network between the loop filter and the wideband VCO. This leads to an almost constant transient and phase noise performance in the complete frequency range. The overall phase noise at the output of the ramp generator is below -99dBc/Hz at offset frequencies above 10 kHz. The proposed ramp generator allows for fast and accurate network analysis which is demonstrated by means of measurements with a homodyne prototype system. The sweep time of the system (0.5 ms) is significantly shorter compared to previously published ramp based systems and commercial network analyzers, and allows monitoring of rapidly changing measurement scenarios.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Phase noise","Phase locked loops","Frequency measurement","Generators","Frequency conversion","Wideband","Voltage-controlled oscillators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["network analysis","phase locked loops","phase noise","ramp generators","voltage-controlled oscillators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["sweep time","phase noise performance","constant transient performance","wideband VCO","loop filter","voltage dependent damping network","loop gain variation","wideband PLL-stabilization","PLL-stabilized VCO","frequency band","wideband voltage-controlled oscillator","highly linear analog frequency ramps","fractional-N phase locked loop","very fast network analysis","broadband frequency ramp generator","frequency 0.4 GHz to 6 GHz","frequency 8.4 GHz to 14 GHz"]}],"doi":"10.1109/EuMC.2016.7824520","publicationTitle":"2016 46th European Microwave Conference (EuMC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 46th European Microwave Conference (EuMC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7805383/7824247/07824520.pdf","startPage":"1023","endPage":"1026","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7824247","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EuMC.2016.7824520","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A broadband frequency ramp generator for very fast network analysis based on a fractional-N phase locked loop","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7824520","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A broadband frequency ramp generator for very fast network analysis based on a fractional-N phase locked loop","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7824520/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7824520/","accessionNumber":"16603530","conferenceDate":"4-6 Oct. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-6 Oct. 2016","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A broadband frequency ramp generator for very fast network analysis based on a fractional-N phase locked loop","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1297.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041394S","chronDate":"4-6 Oct. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7805383","isNumber":"7824247","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7805383","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"7824247","articleId":"7824520","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"European Microwave Association","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":7824523,"authors":[{"name":"B.

The components of the model structure are subsequently pruned through the use of a compressed-sensing algorithm that selects the active regressors from the full model.

Here, a proposal for a reconfigurable reflectarray is presented, with the main novelty being the control of the amplitude of the reflection via individually addressable optically reconfigurable elements. Initially, a study of the achievable radiation patterns from numerically modelling the reflectarray geometry is presented. Following this, the unit cell which will achieve the required amplitude and phase variations is presented. Reflection amplitude variation is achieved in the unit cell by optically exciting a semiconductor substrate using LEDs. To accurately model the semiconductor under illumination, a characterisation setup was used. Finally, the radiation patterns of a small reflectarray are compared with the numerically modelled patterns to verify both the reconfiguration mechanism and the numerical model.","doi":"10.1109/EuMC.2016.7824588","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EuMC.2016.7824588","startPage":"1295","endPage":"1298","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 46th European Microwave Conference (EuMC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7805383/7824247/07824588.pdf","publicationTitle":"2016 46th European Microwave Conference (EuMC)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7824247","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Ka-band reflectarray with variable amplitude unit cells","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"4-6 Oct. 2016","displayDocTitle":"A Ka-band reflectarray with variable amplitude unit cells","conferenceDate":"4-6 Oct. 2016","publicationDate":"Oct. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2017","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7824588/","accessionNumber":"16603601","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7824588/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Ka-band reflectarray with variable amplitude unit cells","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1764.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.076439S","chronDate":"4-6 Oct. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7805383","isNumber":"7824247","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7805383","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7824247","articleId":"7824588","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"European Microwave Association","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":7824590,"authors":[{"name":"Lu Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering and Information Science, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, China"],"firstName":"Lu","lastName":"Wang","id":"37085506324"},{"name":"Gang Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering and Information Science, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, China","Key Laboratory of Electromagnetic Space Information, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Hefei, China"],"firstName":"Gang","lastName":"Wang","id":"37536958000"},{"name":"Qi Zhao","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering and Information Science, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, China"],"firstName":"Qi","lastName":"Zhao","id":"37086016667"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-2-87487-043-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1514-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7824590","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":278},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Mutual coupling","Antenna radiation patterns","Optimization","Correlation coefficient","Scattering parameters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","electromagnetic coupling","optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mutual coupling suppression","MIMO antennas","multiple-input multiple-output antennas","multi-objective optimization","parasitic fragment-type isolation element","frequency 2.45 GHz"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Antenna isolation","mutual coupling","MIMO systems","parasitic fragment-type element"]}],"abstract":"Parasitic fragment-type element can be used in suppressing mutual coupling of multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) antennas.

Performance measurements were conducted by using a testbed equipped with single radio. Test results with LTE signal have not been reported so far. Measured SNR of the recovered LTE signal was 31.33 dB on average in indoor environment. From the implementation perspective, the transient time during the beam switching results in performance degradation. It is beneficial to reduce the time as short as possible by using fast switching device. Considering that transient time is fixed once a switching device is hardwired, it is good to reduce the switching rate as possible because low switching rate corresponds to the reduced occurrence of transient state.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"LTE based spatial multiplexing MIMO with single radio","publicationTitle":"2016 46th European Microwave Conference (EuMC)","doi":"10.1109/EuMC.2016.7824594","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 46th European Microwave Conference (EuMC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7805383/7824247/07824594.pdf","startPage":"1319","endPage":"1322","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EuMC.2016.7824594","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7824247","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7824594","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7824594/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-6 Oct. 2016","displayDocTitle":"LTE based spatial multiplexing MIMO with single radio","conferenceDate":"4-6 Oct. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7824594/","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2017","publicationDate":"Oct. 2016","accessionNumber":"16603600","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"LTE based spatial multiplexing MIMO with single radio","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"1515.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051938S","chronDate":"4-6 Oct. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7805383","isNumber":"7824247","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7805383","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7824247","articleId":"7824594","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"European Microwave Association","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7824641,"authors":[{"name":"Stephan Stanko","affiliation":["MHS Fraunhofer FHR, Wachtberg, Germany"],"firstName":"Stephan","lastName":"Stanko","id":"37319786700"},{"name":"Stephan Palm","affiliation":["MHS Fraunhofer FHR, Wachtberg, Germany"],"firstName":"Stephan","lastName":"Palm","id":"37085732576"},{"name":"Rainer Sommer","affiliation":["MHS Fraunhofer FHR, Wachtberg, Germany"],"firstName":"Rainer","lastName":"Sommer","id":"37409136400"},{"name":"Frank Kl\u00f6ppel","affiliation":["MHS Fraunhofer FHR, Wachtberg, Germany"],"firstName":"Frank","lastName":"Kl\u00f6ppel","id":"37563091200"},{"name":"Michael Caris","affiliation":["MHS, Fraunhofer FHR, Wachtberg, Germany"],"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Caris"},{"name":"Nils Pohl","affiliation":["MHS Fraunhofer FHR, Wachtberg, Germany"],"firstName":"Nils","lastName":"Pohl","id":"37303029500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-2-87487-043-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1514-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7824641","dbTime":"19 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":420},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Synthetic aperture radar","Chirp","Bandwidth","Radar antennas","Image resolution","Millimeter wave radar"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CW radar","FM radar","millimetre wave radar","radar imaging","synthetic aperture radar"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["millimeter resolution SAR imaging","MIRANDA-300 street borne SAR system","millimeter wave FMCW radar","transmitted signal","mobile mapping","frequency 300 GHz"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["high resolution","SAR","infrastructure"]}],"abstract":"This paper describes the Set-up of the MIRANDA-300 street borne SAR system as well as measurements and possible applications.

One of the drawbacks of OFDM transmission is the large variations in the instantaneous transmit power. This implies a reduced efficiency in power amplifiers and results in lower average power of the transmission signal. SC-FDM is utilized for 4G radio access technology such as Uplink communication of Long Term Evolution (LTE) in order to mitigate the above drawback of OFDM. Among the modulations in this communication system are QPSK, 16QAM and 64QAM. Zadoff-Chu sequence is used as Pilots for SC-FDM both for Channel Estimation and Phase Compensation of Doppler shift. Both Field Experiment at sea port in Okinawa, Japan and computer simulation show the quantitative merits of SC-FDM than OFDM. Peak-to-average Power Ratio (PAPR) of the transmitted signal has been successfully reduced by 1.5-2.0 dB for various modulations and roughly 50% of communication distance can be extended.","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 International Symposium on Intelligent Signal Processing and Communication Systems (ISPACS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7818101/7824673/07824679.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","publicationTitle":"2016 International Symposium on Intelligent Signal Processing and Communication Systems (ISPACS)","doi":"10.1109/ISPACS.2016.7824679","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISPACS.2016.7824679","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7824673","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7824679","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Comparison of SC-FDM with OFDM in underwater acoustic communication system","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Bit error rate","Phase shift keying","Peak to average power ratio","Ports (Computers)","Underwater acoustics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Doppler shift","frequency division multiplexing","quadrature amplitude modulation","quadrature phase shift keying","underwater acoustic communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["single carrier frequency division multiplex","SC-FDM","orthogonal frequency division multiplex","underwater acoustic communication","OFDM transmission","4G radio access technology","uplink communication","Long Term Evolution","LTE","QPSK","16QAM","64QAM","Zadoff-Chu sequence","channel estimation","phase compensation","Doppler shift","peak-to-average power ratio","PAPR"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Underwater","Acoustic Communication","PAPR","SCFDM","OFDM"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7824679/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-27 Oct. 2016","displayDocTitle":"Comparison of SC-FDM with OFDM in underwater acoustic communication system","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7824679/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2016","accessionNumber":"16617135","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2017","conferenceDate":"24-27 Oct. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Comparison of SC-FDM with OFDM in underwater acoustic communication system","confLoc":"Phuket, Thailand","sourcePdf":"00009Camera_ready.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.083349S","chronDate":"24-27 Oct. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7818101","isNumber":"7824673","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7818101","xplore-issue":"7824673","articleId":"7824679","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7824681,"authors":[{"name":"Tushar Supe","affiliation":["Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, US"],"firstName":"Tushar","lastName":"Supe"},{"name":"David Anderson","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, Georgia, USA"],"firstName":"David","lastName":"Anderson","id":"37278895600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-0629-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-0628-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-0630-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7824681","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":206},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7824681","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Approximation algorithms","Algorithm design and analysis","Computers","Table lookup","Estimation","Delays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["iterative methods","mathematics computing","parallel algorithms","redundant number systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["super-CORDIC","approximation based parallel and redundant CORDIC","coordinate rotation digital computer","circular coordinate system","trigonometric functions","redundant representations","scaling factor compensation","functional verification"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Coordinate rotation digital computer (CORDIC)","Low Latency","Generalized Architecture","Redundant Number Representation","Parallel Computation","Trigonometric Functions"]}],"abstract":"This paper proposes an optimized and generalized Co-ordinate Rotation Digital Computer (CORDIC) algorithm in the rotation mode of the circular co-ordinate system.

If a delay spread of multipath is within a cyclic prefix (CP), FDE is effective in compensating channel distortion. However, long delay waves should be considered when reflected waves arrive from water surfaces, water bottoms, and obstacles in shallow sea environment. If a very long CP is used, it induces a large delay in communication response. This work compares performance of SC-FDE and OFDM with a short CP for long delay multipath. As for QPSK transmission, SC-FDE is less sensitive to inter-block interference (IBI) and inter-carrier interference (ICI) caused by multipath interference.

Generally, separation precision is lower when the basic method of blind signal separation is used for the sound signals. It is the cause that the power of the sound signals is concentrated in the low-frequency band. For the problem, we already considered that the method of the blind signal separation using QMF. Specifically, the mixed signals are divided into two frequency bands, and we perform suitable separation for each two bands. As the result, the conventional method has higher separation precision than the basic method. However, in the low-frequency band, power spectrum is not constant for frequency. Therefore, it is expected that the separation precision is higher than the conventional method by performing the suitable separation for each of signals based on the division to several narrow frequency bands on the low-frequency band. Then, in this paper, we propose the method that has higher separation precision and we evaluate the proposed method by computer simulation.","doi":"10.1109/ISPACS.2016.7824684","publicationTitle":"2016 International Symposium on Intelligent Signal Processing and Communication Systems (ISPACS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 International Symposium on Intelligent Signal Processing and Communication Systems (ISPACS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7818101/7824673/07824684.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISPACS.2016.7824684","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7824673","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Blind signal separation based on band division using QMF Bank","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7824684","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-27 Oct. 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7824684/","displayDocTitle":"Blind signal separation based on band division using QMF Bank","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2016","accessionNumber":"16617218","htmlLink":"/document/7824684/","conferenceDate":"24-27 Oct. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Blind signal separation based on band division using QMF Bank","confLoc":"Phuket, Thailand","sourcePdf":"00016Camera_ready.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044837S","chronDate":"24-27 Oct. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7818101","isNumber":"7824673","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7818101","xplore-issue":"7824673","articleId":"7824684","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7824689,"authors":[{"name":"Masahiro Kubo","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Electrical Engineering, Keio University, Yokohama, Kanagawa, Japan"],"firstName":"Masahiro","lastName":"Kubo","id":"37085651614"},{"name":"Taro Kosaka","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Electrical Engineering, Keio University, Yokohama, Kanagawa, Japan"],"firstName":"Taro","lastName":"Kosaka","id":"37085646210"},{"name":"Takanori Miyawaki","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Electrical Engineering, Keio University, Yokohama, Kanagawa, Japan"],"firstName":"Takanori","lastName":"Miyawaki","id":"37086074510"},{"name":"Kota Ito","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Electrical Engineering, Keio University, Yokohama, Kanagawa, Japan"],"firstName":"Kota","lastName":"Ito","id":"37086074692"},{"name":"Nobuhiko Nakano","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Electrical Engineering, Keio University, Yokohama, Kanagawa, Japan"],"firstName":"Nobuhiko","lastName":"Nakano","id":"37085377252"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-0629-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-0628-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-0630-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7824689","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":121},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7824689","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Current measurement","Ions","Electronics packaging","Cutoff frequency","Radio frequency","Frequency response","Multiplexing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biomedical electronics","biomedical measurement","biomembrane transport","diseases","low noise amplifiers","medical signal processing","neurophysiology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["valiable frequency characteristics multichannel on-chip patch-clamp system","CMOS technology","electrophysiology","ion current","neurological disease treatment","neuronal activity","multichannel patch-clamp measurement system","I-V converter","parasitic component compensation circuit","programmable gain amplifier","antialiasing filter","multiplexer","serial to parallel converter","current-to-voltage conversion rate","cutoff frequency","variable capacitance","CMOS process 8-channel system","chip size","size 2.5 mm","size 5 mm","resistance 379 Gohm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Patch-clamp measurement","Electrophysiology","I\u2013V converter","Low-noise amplifier","Programmable gain amplifier","Anti-aliasing filter"]}],"abstract":"Patch-clamp measurement system is one of the useful techniques in the field of Electrophysiology.

The main idea of this architecture design are line delay and SAD processor array.

The processor array (PA) contains 40\u00d7100 SAD processing elements (PEs) that are mapped into horizontal structure. We synthesize and implement the proposed design in FPGA Altera DE2-115. It can reach 128.35 MHz as maximum frequency and occupies 59,899 memory bits; 17,158 registers and 17,411 combinationals. It needs 307,200 clock cycles to finish a single image. By using 100 MHz clock frequency, a single image processing can be conducted in 3.072 ms (325 fps).

We divide disaster areas in-to key survey regions and normal survey regions based on partitioning the photo taken by a conventional satellite. Key survey regions which require a comprehensive survey contain much more complicated buildings and structures compared with those in normal survey regions. Some of the UAVs are used to comprehensively scan the key survey regions. The others are used to roughly scan the normal survey regions. All of the UAVs finish those scanning tasks in cooperation. A math model is built to find the optimal paths for multiple UAVs to scan the whole area with the minimum cost of time. The experimental results show that the number of photos reduces 41.07%, the scan time reduces 33.23% and the time consumed by building the 3D model reduces 38.75% compared with the other methods.

However, the recognition task can become complicated due to the existence of covariate factors (e.g. clothing, camera viewpoint, carrying condition, elapsed time, walking surface, etc).

This is because it may obscure a significant amount of discriminative human gait features and makes it much more challenging for human recognition task. In recent, there has been significant research on this problem. However, conventional state-of-the-art methods have mostly use hand-crafted features for representing the human gait. In this work, we explore and study the use of convolutional neural networks (CNN) to automatically learn gait features or representations directly from low-level input raw data (i.e. Gait Energy Image (GEI)). Evaluations on the challenging clothing-invariant gait recognition of OU-ISIR Treadmill dataset B, the experiment results shows that our method can achieve far better performance as compared to hand-crafted feature in conventional state-of-the-art methods with minimal preprocessing knowledge of the problem are required.","doi":"10.1109/ISPACS.2016.7824728","publicationTitle":"2016 International Symposium on Intelligent Signal Processing and Communication Systems (ISPACS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 International Symposium on Intelligent Signal Processing and Communication Systems (ISPACS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7818101/7824673/07824728.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7824673","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISPACS.2016.7824728","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Clothing-invariant gait recognition using convolutional neural network","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7824728/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-27 Oct. 2016","displayDocTitle":"Clothing-invariant gait recognition using convolutional neural network","htmlLink":"/document/7824728/","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2017","publicationDate":"Oct. 2016","accessionNumber":"16617178","conferenceDate":"24-27 Oct. 2016","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Clothing-invariant gait recognition using convolutional neural network","confLoc":"Phuket, Thailand","sourcePdf":"00078Camera_ready.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.088746S","chronDate":"24-27 Oct. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7818101","isNumber":"7824673","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7818101","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"7824673","articleId":"7824728","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7824736,"authors":[{"name":"Komsan Kanjanasit","affiliation":["Department of Computer Engineering, Prince of Songkla University, Phuket, Thailand"],"firstName":"Komsan","lastName":"Kanjanasit","id":"37086098813"},{"name":"Changhai Wang","affiliation":["Institute of Sensors, Signals and Systems, Heriot-Watt University, Edinburgh, United Kingdom"],"firstName":"Changhai","lastName":"Wang","id":"37280024800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-0629-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-0628-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-0630-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7824736","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":501},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7824736","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Apertures","Coplanar waveguides","Impedance","Substrates","Bandwidth","Antenna measurements","Patch antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["broadband antennas","coplanar waveguides","impedance matching","micromachining","microstrip antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["micromachined CPW fed aperture coupled compact patch antenna","double-tuned impedance matching method","X-band frequency region","wide impedance bandwidth","wideband antenna","short-end CPW","coupling aperture","FR4 substrate","suspended patch","triple resonance effect","double-tuned aperture","CPW line","air gap","laser micromachined polymer rim","frequency 8 GHz to 12 GHz"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Wideband","High Performance","Patch antenna","Coupled Aperture","Impedance matching","Double tuned matching","CPW-fed"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ISPACS.2016.7824736","publicationTitle":"2016 International Symposium on Intelligent Signal Processing and Communication Systems (ISPACS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 International Symposium on Intelligent Signal Processing and Communication Systems (ISPACS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7818101/7824673/07824736.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISPACS.2016.7824736","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7824673","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A high performance micromachined CPW fed aperture coupled compact patch antenna using a double-tuned impedance matching method","abstract":"This paper presents the design and fabrication of a high-performance patch antenna for operation over the X-band (8 - 12 GHz) frequency region. A wide impedance bandwidth is obtained using a double-tuned impedance matching technique. The wideband antenna consists of a short-end CPW and the coupling aperture on an FR4 substrate, and a suspended patch. The triple resonance effect associated with the characteristics of the double-tuned aperture and the patch is used to achieve wideband performance. The effects of the design parameters of the CPW line, the aperture, air gap and the patch are studied. The patch was fabricated on a thin film LCP substrate. A laser micromachined polymer rim was used to create an air gap between the LCP substrate and the FR4 substrate. The measured results show a good agreement with that of the simulation work. The impedance bandwidth of the antenna is as large as 41% covering the X-band. The 3-dB gain bandwidth is 43% and the maximum gain is 8.5 dBi.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"24-27 Oct. 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7824736/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"16617154","publicationDate":"Oct. 2016","conferenceDate":"24-27 Oct. 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7824736/","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A high performance micromachined CPW fed aperture coupled compact patch antenna using a double-tuned impedance matching method","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A high performance micromachined CPW fed aperture coupled compact patch antenna using a double-tuned impedance matching method","confLoc":"Phuket, Thailand","sourcePdf":"00086Camera_ready.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.075008S","chronDate":"24-27 Oct. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7818101","isNumber":"7824673","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7818101","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7824673","articleId":"7824736","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":7824740,"authors":[{"name":"Tatsumi Uwai","affiliation":["Faculty of Computer Science and Systems Engineering, Kyushu Institute of Technology, Fukuoka, Japan"],"firstName":"Tatsumi","lastName":"Uwai","id":"37086028337"},{"name":"Takuma Miyamoto","affiliation":["Faculty of Computer Science and Systems Engineering, Kyushu Institute of Technology, Fukuoka, Japan"],"firstName":"Takuma","lastName":"Miyamoto","id":"37086028982"},{"name":"Yuhei Nagao","affiliation":["Faculty of Computer Science and Systems Engineering, Kyushu Institute of Technology, Fukuoka, Japan"],"firstName":"Yuhei","lastName":"Nagao","id":"37300972900"},{"name":"Leonardo Lanante","affiliation":["Faculty of Computer Science and Systems Engineering, Kyushu Institute of Technology, Fukuoka, Japan"],"firstName":"Leonardo","lastName":"Lanante","id":"37542593200"},{"name":"Masayuki Kurosaki","affiliation":["Faculty of Computer Science and Systems Engineering, Kyushu Institute of Technology, Fukuoka, Japan"],"firstName":"Masayuki","lastName":"Kurosaki","id":"37284046100"},{"name":"Hiroshi Ochi","affiliation":["Faculty of Computer Science and Systems Engineering, Kyushu Institute of Technology, Fukuoka, Japan"],"firstName":"Hiroshi","lastName":"Ochi","id":"37300847100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-0629-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-0628-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-0630-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7824740","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":902},"abstract":"Random access Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access (OFDMA), a method for uplink multi-user transmission (UL-MU) for STAs with unknown transmit buffer has been adopted in the upcoming IEEE802.11ax next generation wireless LAN standard.

Physically, we should also consider the influence of mutual coupling when the separation of antenna elements becomes limited. Here, we deal with the up-link transmission of the space-time block coded (ST-BC) MIMO-OFDM system, without implemented the cyclic prefix (CP). The penalty of without using CP is that the receiver design of the ST-BC MIMO-OFDM system becomes more sophisticated when it is applied to combat the IBI and maintain the desired system performance, simultaneously. Based on this framework mentioned above, we investigate the mutual coupling effect over slowly-varying multipath channels. Via computer simulation results, we verify the effects of mutual coupling in performance, regarding bit-error-rate.","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 International Symposium on Intelligent Signal Processing and Communication Systems (ISPACS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7818101/7824673/07824755.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","publicationTitle":"2016 International Symposium on Intelligent Signal Processing and Communication Systems (ISPACS)","doi":"10.1109/ISPACS.2016.7824755","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISPACS.2016.7824755","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7824673","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7824755","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The effects of mutual coupling for the space-time block coded MIMO-OFDM systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Receiving antennas","Transmitting antennas","OFDM","Correlation","Mutual coupling","MIMO"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["error statistics","MIMO communication","OFDM modulation","receiving antennas","space-time block codes","transmitting antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mutual coupling effects","multiple-input-multiple-output antenna system","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing technique","space-time block coded MIMO-OFDM systems","ST-BC MIMO-OFDM system","transmitting antennas","receiving antennas","antenna elements separation","cyclic prefix","IBI","bit error rate"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Space-time encoded","OFDM","Multiple antennae","Spatial correlation","Mutual coupling","IBI","ICI","Oblique projection","Block-based DFE equalizer"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7824755/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-27 Oct. 2016","displayDocTitle":"The effects of mutual coupling for the space-time block coded MIMO-OFDM systems","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7824755/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2016","accessionNumber":"16617203","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2017","conferenceDate":"24-27 Oct. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The effects of mutual coupling for the space-time block coded MIMO-OFDM systems","confLoc":"Phuket, Thailand","sourcePdf":"00119Camera_ready.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.094835S","chronDate":"24-27 Oct. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7818101","isNumber":"7824673","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7818101","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7824673","articleId":"7824755","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7824758,"authors":[{"name":"Prusayon Nintanavongsa","affiliation":["Department of Computer Engineering, Rajamangala University of Technology Thanyaburi, Thailand"],"firstName":"Prusayon","lastName":"Nintanavongsa","id":"38232102400"},{"name":"Weerachai Yaemvachi","affiliation":["Department of Computer Engineering, Rajamangala University of Technology Thanyaburi, Thailand"],"firstName":"Weerachai","lastName":"Yaemvachi","id":"37086115920"},{"name":"Itarun Pitimon","affiliation":["Department of Computer Engineering, Rajamangala University of Technology Thanyaburi, Thailand"],"firstName":"Itarun","lastName":"Pitimon","id":"38468759000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-0629-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-0628-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-0630-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7824758","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":455},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Monitoring","Unmanned aerial vehicles","Solar energy","Wireless power transfer","Batteries","Routing protocols"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["agriculture","aircraft communication","autonomous aerial vehicles","productivity","routing protocols","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["self-sustaining unmanned aerial vehicle routing protocol","smart farming","agricultural productivity","agricultural monitoring technique","farming","routing approaches","location-agnostic protocols","location-specific protocols","solar energy harvesting","wireless power transfer capability","optimal UAV routing path","routing protocol"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Self sustaining","Routing protocol","Unmanned Aerial Vehicle","Smart farming","Energy harvesting"]}],"abstract":"Increasing agricultural productivity has been a long quest for farmers and only a few can achieve it. One major factor that hinders them to achieve such goal is the lack of proper agricultural monitoring technique. Recent advancement in technology has enabled the integration of sensor networks and traditional farming, resulting in effective monitoring through smart farming. However, there exists a hefty investment in equipment and infrastructure installation throughout the coverage area. We design two routing approaches, called Location-agnostic (LA) and Location-specific (LS) protocols, to facilitate the self-sustaining agricultural monitoring platform, requiring no infrastructure installation, comprises of Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) with solar energy harvesting and wireless power transfer capability. The LA protocol does not require location information of monitoring stations to be visited prior to the flight, and is useful for dynamic environment. The LS protocol relies on the complete view of the topology prior to the flight and is suitable for static environment. These protocols determine the optimal UAV routing path from a set of monitoring stations under various conditions. Through a combination of simulation and experimentation studies, we demonstrate significant energy efficiency and coverage area improvement over the classical routing protocol.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A self-sustaining unmanned aerial vehicle routing protocol for smart farming","publicationTitle":"2016 International Symposium on Intelligent Signal Processing and Communication Systems (ISPACS)","doi":"10.1109/ISPACS.2016.7824758","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 International Symposium on Intelligent Signal Processing and Communication Systems (ISPACS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7818101/7824673/07824758.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISPACS.2016.7824758","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7824673","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7824758","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7824758/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-27 Oct. 2016","displayDocTitle":"A self-sustaining unmanned aerial vehicle routing protocol for smart farming","conferenceDate":"24-27 Oct. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7824758/","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2017","publicationDate":"Oct. 2016","accessionNumber":"16617201","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A self-sustaining unmanned aerial vehicle routing protocol for smart farming","confLoc":"Phuket, Thailand","sourcePdf":"00125Camera_ready.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058676S","chronDate":"24-27 Oct. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7818101","isNumber":"7824673","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7818101","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7824673","articleId":"7824758","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7824762,"authors":[{"name":"Sethakarn Prongnuch","affiliation":["Faculty of Engineering, Mahanakorn University of Technology, Bangkok, Thailand"],"firstName":"Sethakarn","lastName":"Prongnuch","id":"37086147440"},{"name":"Theerayod Wiangtong","affiliation":["Electronic Engineering Department, Mahanakorn University of Technology, Bangkok, Thailand"],"firstName":"Theerayod","lastName":"Wiangtong","id":"37299311300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-0629-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-0628-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-0630-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7824762","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":411},"abstract":"The Heterogeneous Computing Platform (HCP) contains the multiple types of processing elements which generally are CPUs, GPUs, and DSPs or FPGAs. In this platform, there must be mechanism to control both hardware processing elements and co-processing elements for computational intensive applications. The main challenge is to make all elements work together efficiently through Application Programming Interface (API). This paper proposes performance evaluation of APIs and Partial Reconfigurable (PR) hardware accelerator on HCP.

Many scheduling algorithms have been proposed to map and order clients requests running on a suitable processor at the minimum makespan and maximum resource utilization. However, they do not take into account the task scheduling under bounded number of I/O port constraint which is a realistic communications model between client and server. Based on the I/O port constraint, this paper proposes a one I/O port task scheduling using a hybrid heuristicgenetic algorithm to achieve minimum completion time. For practical scenario, web service workflow represented by the Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) of tasks is implemented as an input task set. The proposed algorithm focuses on sending the clients request of web services and receiving results having minimum makespan and delay. Unlike Genetic Algorithm (GA) providing near optimal results but high time complexity, the proposed approach named Critical Path with Genetic Algorithm (CPGA) incorporates GA to produce the good quality schedule with lower processing time. Preliminary result of fair comparisons with existing scheduling methods shows that the proposed approach outperforms them in terms of minimum makespan and delay.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7824673","publicationTitle":"2016 International Symposium on Intelligent Signal Processing and Communication Systems (ISPACS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 International Symposium on Intelligent Signal Processing and Communication Systems (ISPACS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7818101/7824673/07824770.pdf","doi":"10.1109/ISPACS.2016.7824770","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISPACS.2016.7824770","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A heuristic-genetic algorithm for client web service scheduling constrained by one I/O port","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"24-27 Oct. 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7824770/","displayDocTitle":"A heuristic-genetic algorithm for client web service scheduling constrained by one I/O port","htmlLink":"/document/7824770/","conferenceDate":"24-27 Oct. 2016","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"16617177","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2017","publicationDate":"Oct. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A heuristic-genetic algorithm for client web service scheduling constrained by one I/O port","confLoc":"Phuket, Thailand","sourcePdf":"00149Camera_ready.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051301S","chronDate":"24-27 Oct. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7818101","isNumber":"7824673","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7818101","xplore-issue":"7824673","articleId":"7824770","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":7824799,"authors":[{"name":"Vijitha Robinson","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science & Engineering, Mar Baselios College of Engineering & Technology, Thiruvananthapuram"],"firstName":"Vijitha","lastName":"Robinson","id":"37086068062"},{"name":"Elizabeth B.

The brain serves to control and coordinate the mental and physical actions. It has the capacity to store innumerable data. This data includes not only childhood memories but also those related to the present age. Tracking the electrical potentials or impulses, commonly known as brain waves, can be utilized for various purposes ranging from diagnosing diseases to decoding personality traits. This can be done using the technique of Electroencephalography (EEG). The amount of data available is exploding so also the opportunities of data mining thereby mounting privacy risks. The current practice either prevents the reuse of raw EEG signals or disrespects participants' right to privacy by using this data for purposes other than those consented to, by the individual. The aim of this work is to put a stop to such privacy risks by extracting and transferring only those features related to an application. Feature is a specific characteristic measurement of a pattern segment. EEG signal processing pertains mainly to feature extraction. There are different methods for extracting features from EEG signals. In this work, the features related to neurological diseases, namely epilepsy and Alzheimer's disease, are extracted using Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) and those related to Schizophrenia are extracted using Autoregressive (AR) method. For securing the raw data, it is doubly encrypted using Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) algorithm and is kept under the control of each user. The proposed system thus ensures the privacy of an individual's EEG signals, and mitigates any risk that may arise if raw data is made available as such to the public.","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 International Conference on Inventive Computation Technologies (ICICT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7811903/7824784/07824799.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","publicationTitle":"2016 International Conference on Inventive Computation Technologies (ICICT)","doi":"10.1109/INVENTIVE.2016.7824799","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INVENTIVE.2016.7824799","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7824784","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7824799","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A novel approach for ensuring the privacy of EEG signals using application-specific feature extraction and AES algorithm","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Electroencephalography","Feature extraction","Discrete wavelet transforms","Diseases","Encryption","Data privacy","Standards"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["autoregressive processes","cryptography","data mining","data privacy","discrete wavelet transforms","diseases","electroencephalography","medical signal processing","patient diagnosis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["EEG signal privacy","application-specific feature extraction","AES algorithm","human brain","complex organs","childhood memories","brain waves","disease diagnosis","personality traits","electroencephalography","data mining","privacy risks","neurological diseases","Alzheimer disease","epilepsy","discrete wavelet transform","DWT","Schizophrenia","autoregressive method","AR","advanced encryption standard"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Brain Waves","Electroencephalography (EEG)","Privacy","Feature Extraction","Encryption"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7824799/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-27 Aug. 2016","displayDocTitle":"A novel approach for ensuring the privacy of EEG signals using application-specific feature extraction and AES algorithm","isConference":true,"volume":"2","htmlLink":"/document/7824799/","publicationDate":"Aug. 2016","accessionNumber":"16616719","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2017","conferenceDate":"26-27 Aug. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A novel approach for ensuring the privacy of EEG signals using application-specific feature extraction and AES algorithm","confLoc":"Coimbatore, India","sourcePdf":"109.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047568S","chronDate":"26-27 Aug. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7811903","isNumber":"7824784","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7811903","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7824784","articleId":"7824799","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7824810,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaobao Sheng","affiliation":["The 3rd Research Institute of Ministry of Public Security, Shanghai, P.R.

To achieve this, a novel architecture for the efficient and swift computation of DCT is proposed consisting of 83 pipeline stages and achieving a maximum clock speed of 156.424 MHz simulated in Xilinx ISE Design Suite 13.2 with Spartan 3E as the target FPGA.","doi":"10.1109/INVENTIVE.2016.7824821","publicationTitle":"2016 International Conference on Inventive Computation Technologies (ICICT)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 International Conference on Inventive Computation Technologies (ICICT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7811903/7824784/07824821.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7824784","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INVENTIVE.2016.7824821","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A high throughput architecture of DCTQ processor suitable for FPGA implementation utilizing Fox algorithm","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7824821/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-27 Aug. 2016","displayDocTitle":"A high throughput architecture of DCTQ processor suitable for FPGA implementation utilizing Fox algorithm","htmlLink":"/document/7824821/","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2017","publicationDate":"Aug. 2016","accessionNumber":"16604742","conferenceDate":"26-27 Aug. 2016","isConference":true,"volume":"2","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A high throughput architecture of DCTQ processor suitable for FPGA implementation utilizing Fox algorithm","confLoc":"Coimbatore, India","sourcePdf":"13.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.075198S","chronDate":"26-27 Aug. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7811903","isNumber":"7824784","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7811903","xplore-issue":"7824784","articleId":"7824821","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7824842,"authors":[{"name":"K V Kavitha","affiliation":["Sree Chitra Thirunal College of Engineering, Thiruvananthapuram, Kerala, IN"],"firstName":"K V","lastName":"Kavitha","id":"37089047250"},{"name":"Vinza V Suthan","affiliation":["Department of CSE, SCT College of Engineering, Trivandrum, India"],"firstName":"Vinza V","lastName":"Suthan","id":"37086074723"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1285-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"DVD ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1283-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1286-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7824842","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":177},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Servers","Genetic algorithms","Cloud computing","Multimedia communication","Load management","Heuristic algorithms","Streaming media"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","genetic algorithms","integer programming","linear programming","multimedia systems","resource allocation","storage management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud based multimedia system","genetic algorithm","cloud computing","information retrieve","cloud based storage","resource manager","information service","server clusters","assignment features","multimedia message jobs","multimedia services","integer linear programming","GA","dynamic multiservice load balancing","CMS"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Genetic algorithm","metaheuristic","load balancing","cloud computing","multimedia system"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7824842","abstract":"Nowadays cloud computing is the most advanced paradigm promising to show the vision of computing applicability into reality. It provides a versatile and straightforward way to store and retrieve immense information left-out concern the hardware required. Cloud based Storage (CS) incorporates a resource manager, cluster head and server clusters. Inside the resource manager the client's request for information service tasks to server clusters in line with the assignment features. And each cluster head distributes the assigned task to the servers inside its server cluster. In Cloud based Storage every server clusters completely handles a particular kind of information service and receives the client's request dynamically in different time steps. It is a research challenge to design an efficient load balancing algorithm which can assign the multimedia message jobs with minimum cost between server clusters and clients while not overloading the server clusters. Differing from previous works, this paper takes into account a more practical dynamic services scenario in which each server clusters handles only a particular type of multimedia task and each client request different type of multimedia services at different time. Such scenario can be handled as an integer linear programming problem which is computationally in feasible in general. In this paper an attempt to solve the problem by an efficient GA in immigrant scheme Simulation results exhibit that the proposed genetic algorithm can efficiently cope with dynamic multi-service load balancing in CMS.","doi":"10.1109/INVENTIVE.2016.7824842","pdfPath":"/iel7/7811903/7824784/07824842.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 International Conference on Inventive Computation Technologies (ICICT)","publicationTitle":"2016 International Conference on Inventive Computation Technologies (ICICT)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INVENTIVE.2016.7824842","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7824784","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dynamic load balancing in cloud based multimedia system with genetic algorithm","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7824842/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-27 Aug. 2016","displayDocTitle":"Dynamic load balancing in cloud based multimedia system with genetic algorithm","isConference":true,"volume":"2","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2017","accessionNumber":"16616756","publicationDate":"Aug. 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7824842/","conferenceDate":"26-27 Aug. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamic load balancing in cloud based multimedia system with genetic algorithm","confLoc":"Coimbatore, India","sourcePdf":"34.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054011S","chronDate":"26-27 Aug. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7811903","isNumber":"7824784","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7811903","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7824784","articleId":"7824842","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":7824846,"authors":[{"name":"Sandeep Ankush Maske","affiliation":["Dept. of Computer Networks, Sinhgad Institute of Technology, Lonavala, India"],"firstName":"Sandeep Ankush","lastName":"Maske","id":"37086122703"},{"name":"Thaksen.

Several research groups have been proposed different model mechanisms to explain the pathophysiology of this disorder. It has been observed that Deep brain stimulation (DBS) at the subthalamic nucleus (STN) neuron site improves the PD as a new, effective and efficient treatment method. The firing properties of STN neurons in terms of single-spike or the burst modes modulate pathophysiological conditions in PD. It is essential to study the electrical firing properties of STN neuron to understand the PD symptoms in a better way. Nowadays, Computational models are the most effective techniques in investigating complex biological processes. Here, we have simulated different firing patterns in STN neuron using the popular Izhikevich model. By tuning some parameters in our model, we can alter the firing patterns from single mode to burst mode in single STN cell. In future, this simple firing rate model can be coupled to other neuronal models in basal ganglia to investigate movement disorders.","doi":"10.1109/INVENTIVE.2016.7824871","publicationTitle":"2016 International Conference on Inventive Computation Technologies (ICICT)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 International Conference on Inventive Computation Technologies (ICICT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7811903/7824784/07824871.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7824784","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INVENTIVE.2016.7824871","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7824871","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-27 Aug. 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7824871/","displayDocTitle":"Computational simulation of spike patterns in STN neuron using Izhikevich model","isConference":true,"volume":"2","publicationDate":"Aug. 2016","accessionNumber":"16616769","htmlLink":"/document/7824871/","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2017","conferenceDate":"26-27 Aug. 2016","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Computational simulation of spike patterns in STN neuron using Izhikevich model","confLoc":"Coimbatore, India","sourcePdf":"63.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.040125S","chronDate":"26-27 Aug. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7811903","isNumber":"7824784","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7811903","xplore-issue":"7824784","articleId":"7824871","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":7824926,"authors":[{"name":"Jianwei Pang","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of High-efficiency and Clean Mechanical Manufacture, Shandong University, Jinan, China"],"firstName":"Jianwei","lastName":"Pang","id":"37086072963"},{"name":"Pengbo Liu","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of High-efficiency and Clean Mechanical Manufacture, Shandong University, Jinan, China"],"firstName":"Pengbo","lastName":"Liu","id":"37085375978"},{"name":"Peng Yan","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of High-efficiency and Clean Mechanical Manufacture, Shandong University, Jinan, China"],"firstName":"Peng","lastName":"Yan","id":"37077660400"},{"name":"Zhen Zhang","affiliation":["Manufacturing Equipments and Control, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Zhen","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37072737000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2945-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2944-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2946-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7824926","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":242},"abstract":"This paper presents a hybrid modeling method combining the pseudo-rigid-body-model (PRBM) and Euler-Bernoulli beam theory for a composite bridge-type amplifier (CBTA) based nano-positioning stage.

TIA - read scheme is more tolerant for the ADC misread than PD-read scheme, thus be more suitable as the multi-level read-out scheme.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7824929/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-22 July 2016","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7824929/","publicationDate":"July 2016","accessionNumber":"16616150","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2017","conferenceDate":"18-22 July 2016","displayDocTitle":"Practical considerations of read-out circuits for passive, multi-level ReRAM arrays","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Practical considerations of read-out circuits for passive, multi-level ReRAM arrays","confLoc":"Chongqing, China","sourcePdf":"1600412.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.084527S","chronDate":"18-22 July 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7801991","isNumber":"7824665","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7801991","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7824665","articleId":"7824929","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7824948,"authors":[{"name":"Yinan Wu","affiliation":["Tianjin Key Laboratory of Intelligent Robotics, Tianjin, China","Institute of Robotics and Automatic Information System, Nankai University, Tianjin, China"],"firstName":"Yinan","lastName":"Wu","id":"37085469556"},{"name":"Yongchun Fang","affiliation":["Institute of Robotics and Automatic Information System, Nankai University, Tianjin, China","Tianjin Key Laboratory of Intelligent Robotics, Tianjin, China"],"firstName":"Yongchun","lastName":"Fang","id":"37293583100"},{"name":"Xiao Ren","affiliation":["Tianjin Key Laboratory of Intelligent Robotics, Tianjin, China","Institute of Robotics and Automatic Information System, Nankai University, Tianjin, China"],"firstName":"Xiao","lastName":"Ren","id":"37085423611"},{"name":"Han Lu","affiliation":["Tianjin Key Laboratory of Intelligent Robotics, Tianjin, China","Institute of Robotics and Automatic Information System, Nankai University, Tianjin, China"],"firstName":"Han","lastName":"Lu","id":"37085417186"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2945-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2944-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2946-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7824948","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":192},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7824948","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hysteresis","Actuators","Splines (mathematics)","Interpolation","Numerical models","Nanoscale devices","Neural networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["atomic force microscopy","backpropagation","hysteresis","neural nets","piezoelectric devices"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["back propagation neural networks","hysteresis modeling","compensation","piezoelectric scanner","actuator","hysteresis behavior","memory characteristics","frequency dependence","cubic spline interpolation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Atomic Force Microscopy","Hysteresis","Back Propagation Neural Networks"]}],"doi":"10.1109/3M-NANO.2016.7824948","pdfPath":"/iel7/7801991/7824665/07824948.pdf","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE International Conference on Manipulation, Manufacturing and Measurement on the Nanoscale (3M-NANO)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE International Conference on Manipulation, Manufacturing and Measurement on the Nanoscale (3M-NANO)","startPage":"119","endPage":"124","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7824665","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/3M-NANO.2016.7824948","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Back propagation neural networks based hysteresis modeling and compensation for a piezoelectric scanner","abstract":"As the actuator of a common atomic force microscopy (AFM), a piezoelectric scanner has many advantages than other actuators, such as high precision of displacements on the nanoscale, high efficiency of electromechanical coupling, rapid response and so on. However, hysteresis nonlinearity of a piezoelectric scanner affects the positioning of the scanner and image quality of an AFM system. In this paper, a modeling method based on Back Propagation Neural Networks (BPNN) is proposed to compensate for hysteresis behavior. In particular, considering memory characteristics and frequency dependence of the hysteresis effect, firstly, we utilize a two hidden layers BPNN consisting of an input layer including the frequency and a section of the input voltage, two hidden layers, and an output layer to model for hysteresis. Subsequently, a method based on cubic spline interpolation is proposed to compensate for hysteresis behavior. Experiment results demonstrate the high precision of the obtained hysteresis model and the good performance of the proposed compensation method.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-22 July 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7824948/","accessionNumber":"16616191","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7824948/","publicationDate":"July 2016","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2017","conferenceDate":"18-22 July 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Back propagation neural networks based hysteresis modeling and compensation for a piezoelectric scanner","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Back propagation neural networks based hysteresis modeling and compensation for a piezoelectric scanner","confLoc":"Chongqing, China","sourcePdf":"1600801.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.099075S","chronDate":"18-22 July 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7801991","isNumber":"7824665","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7801991","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"7824665","articleId":"7824948","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":7824949,"authors":[{"name":"S.

The model explicitly links the input pressure applied to the actuator to the resulting bending angle in free space and to the contact force when the actuator tip is in contact with an external rigid obstacle. The model predictions are compared to available experimental data for hemi-circular actuator with uniform wall thicknesses. The validated model is then used for design optimization of actuator's wall thicknesses which represent key geometric parameters. The model predicts that for a fixed air chamber radius, actuator with optimized wall thicknesses requires about 48 % lower input pressure to achieve a prescribed bending angle compared to non-optimized actuator with uniform wall thicknesses. In addition, the optimized actuator generates about 18 % stronger contact force between the distal tip and a rigid obstacle compared to the contact force generated by actuator with uniform wall thicknesses.","doi":"10.1109/3M-NANO.2016.7824949","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE International Conference on Manipulation, Manufacturing and Measurement on the Nanoscale (3M-NANO)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE International Conference on Manipulation, Manufacturing and Measurement on the Nanoscale (3M-NANO)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7801991/7824665/07824949.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/3M-NANO.2016.7824949","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7824665","startPage":"136","endPage":"140","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Model-based design optimization of soft fiber-reinforced bending actuators","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7824949","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Model-based design optimization of soft fiber-reinforced bending actuators","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-22 July 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7824949/","conferenceDate":"18-22 July 2016","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2016","accessionNumber":"16616189","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7824949/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Model-based design optimization of soft fiber-reinforced bending actuators","confLoc":"Chongqing, China","sourcePdf":"1600811.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.082266S","chronDate":"18-22 July 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7801991","isNumber":"7824665","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7801991","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"7824665","articleId":"7824949","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7824965,"authors":[{"name":"Mengwan Liu","affiliation":["College of Instrumentation and Electrical Engineering, Jilin University, Changchun, Jilin, China","Chongqing Key Laboratory of Multi-scale Manufacturing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Chongqing, China"],"firstName":"Mengwan","lastName":"Liu","id":"37086107555"},{"name":"Daming Zhou","affiliation":["Chongqing Key Laboratory of Multi-scale Manufacturing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Chongqing, China"],"firstName":"Daming","lastName":"Zhou","id":"37086022355"},{"name":"Mingkun Zhang","affiliation":["Chongqing Key Laboratory of Multi-scale Manufacturing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Chongqing, China"],"firstName":"Mingkun","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37085800878"},{"name":"Hong-Liang Cui","affiliation":["College of Instrumentation and Electrical Engineering, Jilin University, Changchun, Jilin, China","Chongqing Key Laboratory of Multi-scale Manufacturing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Chongqing, China"],"firstName":"Hong-Liang","lastName":"Cui","id":"37085645261"},{"name":"Deqiang Wang","affiliation":["Chongqing Key Laboratory of Multi-scale Manufacturing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Chongqing, China"],"firstName":"Deqiang","lastName":"Wang","id":"37405357000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2945-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2944-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2946-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7824965","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":156},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Liquids","Resists","Absorption","Semiconductor device measurement","Substrates","Microfluidics","Thermal stability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["microfluidics","photoresists","terahertz spectroscopy","terahertz wave detectors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["microfluidic chip","terahertz time domain spectroscopy","signal-to-noise ratio","liquid film thickness","terahertz optical path","terahertz spectral detection","SU-8 photoresist","frequency 1.0 THz to 1.5 THz"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["terahertz spectra","microfluidic chip","SU-8 phororesist"]}],"abstract":"Fluidic chips as sample storage devices have been widely used to control and analyze traces of solutions by terahertz time domain spectroscopy (THz-TDS).

Interframe Correlation","abstract":"This paper presents a new hardware algorithm for real-time and nonlinear 2-D electrical capacitance tomography (ECT) imaging, along with its parallel hardware architecture. A potential application of this system is to reconstruct in real time cross-sectional image of a two-phase fluid with different dielectric constants when it passes through a given section of a pipeline. The proposed hardware algorithm explores the spatial correlation that may occur between one or several consecutive frames. It uses this property to reformulate the classical regularized forward and inverse problems that are indeed very time consuming, preventing them to be used for fast ECT applications. As a result, the proposed algorithm features one-single-step iteration with a substantial reduction of the size of the Jacobian matrix. In addition, the intrinsically parallel feature of the algorithm makes it suitable for parallel hardware architecture. This architecture is based on a pipeline multiprocessor architecture using advanced features of field-programmable gate array technology. It explores the variable bit-width and floating-point multipliers array available in the digital signal processor blocks, to cooperatively perform the partial matrix product with associated arithmetic and logic units, and distributed memory. The experimental results obtained on a two-phase flow loop demonstrate the capability of the system to build in real time and with good accuracy (e.g., less than 3% error) the cross-sectional image of the fluid passing through the pipeline. Around 560 frames of 4096 moving boundary pixels can be reconstructed in 1 s using IEEE754 floating-point data representation and a clock frequency of 400 MHz, for a total power consumption of less than 33 W.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7827012/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 January 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2017","volume":"25","issue":"4","accessionNumber":"16759758","dateOfInsertion":"20 March 2017","publicationDate":"April 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7827012/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A Pipelined Parallel Hardware Architecture for 2-D Real-Time Electrical Capacitance Tomography Imaging Using Interframe Correlation","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Pipelined Parallel Hardware Architecture for 2-D Real-Time Electrical Capacitance Tomography Imaging Using Interframe Correlation","sourcePdf":"tvlsi-meribout-2636184-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.089959S","chronDate":"April  2017","xplore-pub-id":"92","isNumber":"7882729","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"7882729","articleId":"7827012","onlineDate":"19 January 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7827014,"authors":[{"name":"Sheng Luo","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"firstName":"Sheng","lastName":"Luo","id":"37085570849"},{"name":"Kah Chan Teh","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"firstName":"Kah Chan","lastName":"Teh","id":"37280857900"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9545"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1939-9359"}],"articleNumber":"7827014","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":308},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Vehicular Technology Society","url":"http://www.vtsociety.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Transmitting antennas","Delays","Buffer storage","Relays","Modulation","MIMO"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["amplify and forward communication","diversity reception","error statistics","relay networks (telecommunication)","synchronisation","transmitting antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["space-shift keying","SSK","buffer-aided amplify-and-forward relaying","dual-hop relaying system","relay node","information buffer","adaptive transmission scheme","source-relay links","relay-destination links","bit-error probability","source node","transmit antennas","information packets","packet delay"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Buffer-aided relaying","space-shift keying (SSK)"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7827014","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2017.2655546","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2017.2655546","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8008868","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/25/8008868/07827014.pdf","startPage":"6899","endPage":"6907","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance of Space-Shift Keying With Buffer-Aided Amplify-and-Forward Relaying","abstract":"In this paper, we study a space-shift keying (SSK) based dual-hop relaying system. We assume that the relay node (RN) possesses an information buffer and propose an adaptive transmission scheme in which the system adaptively chooses the source-relay or the relay-destination links to transmit information in each time slot. We obtain an exact closed-form expression of the average bit-error probability for the system in which the source node has two transmit antennas. For the system with arbitrary number of transmit antennas, an upper bound is provided, and it is shown that the proposed scheme can achieve a diversity order of two by using the asymptotic analysis. The delay of the information packets at the RN is investigated, and two link adaptation schemes are proposed to reduce the average packet delay. Numerical results validate our analysis and show that the proposed scheme can significantly improve the system performance, as compared to the conventional relaying scheme.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7827014/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 January 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7827014/","dateOfInsertion":"11 August 2017","publicationDate":"Aug. 2017","accessionNumber":"17135912","volume":"66","issue":"8","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Performance of Space-Shift Keying With Buffer-Aided Amplify-and-Forward Relaying","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance of Space-Shift Keying With Buffer-Aided Amplify-and-Forward Relaying","sourcePdf":"tvt-teh-2655546-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.076016S","chronDate":"Aug.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"8008868","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"8008868","articleId":"7827014","onlineDate":"19 January 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":7827016,"authors":[{"name":"Trong Huynh-Bao","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Informatics, Vrije Universiteit Brussel, Brussel, Belgium","Interuniversity Microelectronics Center, Leuven, Belgium"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/92/7909068/7827016/huynh-2647853-small.gif","p":["Trong Huynh-Bao (S\u201913) received the M.Sc.

This paper will holistically analyze the interplay between transistors and interconnect delay and the variability induced by back-end-ofline (BEOL) process for the 5-nm node. A global sensitivity analysis using Monte Carlo simulation is employed as a powerful tool for understanding the significance of different variation sources and propagating these process uncertainties to circuit performance and parametric yield. For the BEOL integration process, our results show that dielectric \u03ba-value is the most sensitive parameter. Regarding the patterning options, the BEOL process using self-aligned quadruple pattering with positive tone process requires more than a 4\u00d7 process margin and suffers from 50% parametric yield loss. The required guardband for lithoetch litho-etch becomes as critical as for the self-aligned double patterning process when the overlay control is 6\u00d7 higher than the critical dimension control. For trench patterning using spacerdefined techniques, a negative tone process is required to achieve a large process window. From a design perspective, the wire length in SoC can be optimized using a disruptive architecture as a vertical FET, which could potentially reduce the average wire length by 11%.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7827016/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 January 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2017","volume":"25","issue":"5","accessionNumber":"16838418","dateOfInsertion":"24 April 2017","publicationDate":"May 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7827016/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Statistical Timing Analysis Considering Device and Interconnect Variability for BEOL Requirements in the 5-nm Node and Beyond","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"IMEC's (sub-)10nm CMOS Industrial Affiliation Program"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Statistical Timing Analysis Considering Device and Interconnect Variability for BEOL Requirements in the 5-nm Node and Beyond","sourcePdf":"tvlsi-huynhbao-2647853-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.118969S","chronDate":"May  2017","xplore-pub-id":"92","isNumber":"7909068","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"7909068","articleId":"7827016","onlineDate":"19 January 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7827017,"authors":[{"name":"Hien Quoc Ngo","affiliation":["School of Electronics, Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Queen\u2019s University Belfast, Belfast, U.K.","Department of Electrical Engineering (ISY), Link\u00f6ping University, Link\u00f6ping, Sweden"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/7874223/7827017/ngo-2655515-small.gif","p":["Hien Quoc Ngo received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering from the Ho Chi Minh City University of Technology, Vietnam, in 2007, the M.S. degree in electronics and radio engineering from Kyung Hee University, South Korea, in 2010, and the Ph.D. degree in communication systems from Link\u00f6ping University (LiU), Sweden, in 2015.

The APs and users have only one antenna each. The APs acquire channel state information through time-division duplex operation and the reception of uplink pilot signals transmitted by the users. The APs perform multiplexing/de-multiplexing through conjugate beamforming on the downlink and matched filtering on the uplink. Closed-form expressions for individual user uplink and downlink throughputs lead to max-min power control algorithms. Max-min power control ensures uniformly good service throughout the area of coverage. A pilot assignment algorithm helps to mitigate the effects of pilot contamination, but power control is far more important in that regard. Cell-Free Massive MIMO has considerably improved performance with respect to a conventional small-cell scheme, whereby each user is served by a dedicated AP, in terms of both 95%-likely per-user throughput and immunity to shadow fading spatial correlation. Under uncorrelated shadow fading conditions, the cell-free scheme provides nearly fivefold improvement in 95%-likely per-user throughput over the small-cell scheme, and tenfold improvement when shadow fading is correlated.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2017.2655515","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7874223","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2017.2655515","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7693/7874223/07827017.pdf","startPage":"1834","endPage":"1850","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cell-Free Massive MIMO Versus Small Cells","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 January 2017","displayDocTitle":"Cell-Free Massive MIMO Versus Small Cells","volume":"16","issue":"3","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2017","dateOfInsertion":"08 March 2017","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7827017/","publicationDate":"March 2017","accessionNumber":"16725096","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7827017/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004359","fundingName":"Vetenskapsr\u00e5det"},{"fundingName":"ELLIIT"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cell-Free Massive MIMO Versus Small Cells","sourcePdf":"twc-ngo-2655515-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.167946S","chronDate":"March  2017","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"7874223","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"537","xplore-issue":"7874223","articleId":"7827017","onlineDate":"19 January 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-26"},{"_id":7827018,"authors":[{"name":"Pramod Mathecken","affiliation":["Department of Signal Processing and Acoustics, School of Electrical Engineering, Aalto, Finland"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/7858803/7827018/mathe-2655481-small.gif","p":["Pramod Mathecken received the M.Sc. and D.Sc. degrees in signal\n processing from Aalto University, Aalto, Finland, in 2011 and 2016, respectively.

To lessen the computational burden and delay incurred onto the receiver, we estimate phase noise using only scattered pilot subcarriers, i.e., no tentative symbol decisions are used in obtaining and improving the phase noise estimate. In particular, the phase noise estimation problem is posed as an unconstrained optimization problem whose minimizer suffers from the so-called amplitude and phase estimation error. These errors arise due to receiver noise, estimation from limited scattered pilot subcarriers and estimation using a dimensionality reduction model. It is empirically shown that, at high signal-to-noise-ratios, the phase estimation error is small. To reduce the amplitude estimation error, we restrict the minimizer to be drawn from the so-called phase noise geometry set when minimizing the cost function. The resulting optimization problem is a nonconvex program. However, using the S-procedure for quadratic equalities, we show that the optimal solution can be obtained by solving the convex dual problem. We also consider a less complex heuristic scheme that achieves the same objective of restricting the minimizer to the phase noise geometry set. Through simulations, we demonstrate improved coded bit-error-rate and phase noise estimation error performance when enforcing the phase noise geometry. For example, at high signal-to-noise-ratios, the probability density function of the phase noise estimation error exhibits thinner tails which results in lower bit-error-rate.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/78/7858803/07827018.pdf","startPage":"2348","endPage":"2362","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2017.2655481","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2017.2655481","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7858803","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7827018","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Constrained Phase Noise Estimation in OFDM Using Scattered Pilots Without Decision Feedback","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Phase noise","Estimation","OFDM","Geometry","Receivers","Optimization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["convex programming","error statistics","OFDM modulation","phase noise","radio links","radio receivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["phase noise estimation error performance","bit-error-rate","quadratic equalities","optimization problem","nonconvex program","cost function","signal-to-noise-ratios","unconstrained optimization problem","tentative symbol decisions","scattered pilot subcarriers","phase noise estimation","receiver","oscillator phase noise","OFDM radio link","decision feedback","scattered pilots","constrained phase noise estimation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["OFDM","Phase Noise","RF-impairments","LTE","5G","Estimation","Optimization","S-procedure"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7827018/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May1, 1 2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 January 2017","displayDocTitle":"Constrained Phase Noise Estimation in OFDM Using Scattered Pilots Without Decision Feedback","volume":"65","issue":"9","htmlLink":"/document/7827018/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"1 May1, 2017","accessionNumber":"16705733","dateOfInsertion":"24 February 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002341","fundingName":"Academy of Finland","grantNumber":"296849"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Constrained Phase Noise Estimation in OFDM Using Scattered Pilots Without Decision Feedback","sourcePdf":"tsp-mathecken-2655481-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.140503S","chronDate":"May1, 1 2017","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"7858803","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"7858803","articleId":"7827018","onlineDate":"19 January 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7827020,"authors":[{"name":"Rabe Arshad","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals, Dhahran, Saudi Arabia"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/7874223/7827020/arsha-2655517-small.gif","p":["Rabe Arshad received the B.Sc. degree (Gold Medalist) in electrical engineering from the University of Engineering and Technology, Lahore, Pakistan, in 2010, the master\u2019s degree in project management from the Shaheed Zulfikar Ali Bhutto Institute of Science and Technology, Pakistan, in 2014.

In dense 5G networks, HO delays may neutralize or even negate the gains offered by network densification. Hence, user mobility imposes a nontrivial challenge to harvest capacity gains via network densification. In this paper, we propose a velocity-aware HO management scheme for two-tier downlink cellular network to mitigate the HO effect on the foreseen densification throughput gains. The proposed HO scheme sacrifices the best base station (BS) connectivity, by skipping HO to some BSs along the user trajectory, to maintain longer connection durations and reduce HO rates. Furthermore, the proposed scheme enables cooperative BS service and strongest interference cancellation to compensate for skipping the best connectivity. To this end, we consider different HO skipping scenarios and develop a velocity-aware mathematical model, via stochastic geometry, to quantify the performance of the proposed HO schemes in terms of the coverage probability and user throughput. The results highlight the HO rate problem in dense cellular environments and show the importance of the proposed HO schemes. Finally, the value of BS cooperation along with handover skipping is quantified for different user mobility profiles.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2017.2655517","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2017.2655517","startPage":"1851","endPage":"1867","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7693/7874223/07827020.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7874223","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Velocity-Aware Handover Management in Two-Tier Cellular Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7827020/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 January 2017","displayDocTitle":"Velocity-Aware Handover Management in Two-Tier Cellular Networks","volume":"16","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"08 March 2017","accessionNumber":"16725079","publicationDate":"March 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7827020/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"KAUST-KFUPM joint research initiative"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Velocity-Aware Handover Management in Two-Tier Cellular Networks","sourcePdf":"twc-arshad-2655517-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.14884S","chronDate":"March  2017","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"7874223","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"52","xplore-issue":"7874223","articleId":"7827020","onlineDate":"19 January 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7827021,"authors":[{"name":"Jiliang Zhang","affiliation":["College of Computer Science and Electronic Engineering, Hunan University, Changsha, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/92/7882729/7827021/zhang-2619682-small.gif","p":["Jiliang Zhang (M\u201915) received the Ph.D. degree in computer science and technology from Hunan University, Changsha, China, in 2015.","From 2013 to 2014, he was a Research Scholar with the Maryland Embedded Systems and Hardware Security Laboratory, University of Maryland at College Park, College Park, MD, USA.

However, existing watermarking techniques may give away sensitive information during the public verification, which enables malicious verifiers or third parties to remove the embedded watermark and resell the design. Current zero-knowledge watermarking verification schemes can address the sensitive information leakage issue but are vulnerable to embedding attacks, which makes them ineffective in preventing the infringement denying of untrusted buyers (verifiers). This paper proposes a new publicly verifiable watermarking detection technique based on chaos-based zero-knowledge interaction and time stamping to resiliently resist the sensitive information leakage and embedding attacks, and is thus robust to the cheating from the prover, verifier, or third party. Experimental results and analysis show that the proposed method has better robustness than the most recent related literature.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7827021/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 January 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2017","volume":"25","issue":"4","accessionNumber":"16759772","dateOfInsertion":"20 March 2017","publicationDate":"April 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7827021/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Publicly Verifiable Watermarking for Intellectual Property Protection in FPGA Design","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61602107"},{"fundingName":"Central Universities Fundamental Research funding of China","grantNumber":"N161704006"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Publicly Verifiable Watermarking for Intellectual Property Protection in FPGA Design","sourcePdf":"tvlsi-zhang-2619682-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.098029S","chronDate":"April  2017","xplore-pub-id":"92","isNumber":"7882729","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"7882729","articleId":"7827021","onlineDate":"19 January 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7827023,"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-8210"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9999"}],"articleNumber":"7827023","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":68},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Circuits and Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieee-cas.org/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computer Society","url":"http://www.computer.org/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Solid-State Circuits Society","url":"http://www.sscs.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7827023","abstract":"Provides a listing of the editorial board, current staff, committee members and society officers.","doi":"10.1109/TVLSI.2017.2652043","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVLSI.2017.2652043","startPage":"C3","endPage":"C3","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/92/7827022/07827023.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7827022","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7827023/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 January 2017","displayDocTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","volume":"25","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2017","publicationDate":"Feb. 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","sourcePdf":"tvlsi-cover3-fill-2652043-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.017329S","chronDate":"Feb.  2017","isNumber":"7827022","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","articleId":"7827023","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":7827034,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaoming Chen","affiliation":["Qamcom Research and Technology AB, Gothenburg, Sweden"],"firstName":"Xiaoming","lastName":"Chen","orcid":"0000-0003-3151-1690","id":"37085780496"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-7798"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2558"},{"format":"CD","value":"2373-7891"}],"articleNumber":"7827034","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":10,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":300},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7827034","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Phase noise","Iterative closest point algorithm","Receivers","Modulation","Feedback loop"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM)","phase noise (PN)"]}],"abstract":"In this letter, the phase noise (PN) effect on orthogonal frequency division multiplexing based multi-node transmission for small cell backhaul is studied.

It is a 2\u00d72 array, consisting of a feeding waveguide, a matching cavity, and a radiating aperture. The proposed design provides sufficient freedom for the radiator to achieve broadband impedance matching. In order to improve radiation efficiency and avoid drawbacks from the traditional machining techniques, a binder-jetting process using metallic particles is adopted to realize the relatively complicated structure. This 3-D metal-direct-printing technique is competent to fabricate waveguide-based structures with high precision. Experimental results are favorably compared to the results of the fabrication by the machining technique. The measured relative bandwidth with VSWR \u2264 1.5 is 23.7% (13.0-16.5 GHz). A high efficiency of 90% is obtained at the center frequency, and more than 80% efficiency can be maintained over a 2.3-GHz bandwidth. This paper shows that the binder-jetting printing technique is a promising manufacturing approach to realizing high-performance waveguide-based antennas and microwave components.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Development of a Wideband and High-Efficiency Waveguide-Based Compact Antenna Radiator With Binder-Jetting Technique","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Components, Packaging and Manufacturing Technology","doi":"10.1109/TCPMT.2016.2646386","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Components, Packaging and Manufacturing Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/5503870/7843693/07827037.pdf","startPage":"254","endPage":"260","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCPMT.2016.2646386","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7843693","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7827037","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7827037/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 January 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2017","displayDocTitle":"Development of a Wideband and High-Efficiency Waveguide-Based Compact Antenna Radiator With Binder-Jetting Technique","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"7","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/7827037/","dateOfInsertion":"06 February 2017","publicationDate":"Feb. 2017","accessionNumber":"16652209","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Development of a Wideband and High-Efficiency Waveguide-Based Compact Antenna Radiator With Binder-Jetting Technique","sourcePdf":"tcpmt-huang-2646386-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.092012S","chronDate":"Feb.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"5503870","isNumber":"7843693","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5503870","citationCount":"24","xplore-issue":"7843693","articleId":"7827037","onlineDate":"19 January 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7827047,"authors":[{"name":"Antonio Maffucci","affiliation":["INFN-Laboratori Nazionali di Frascati, Frascati, Italy","Department of Electrical and Information Engineering, University of Cassino and Southern Lazio, Cassino, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5503870/7903751/7827047/maffu-2643007-small.gif","p":["Antonio Maffucci (S\u201998\u2013M\u201902\u2013SM\u201911) received the Laurea (summa cum laude) degree in electronic engineering and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from the University of Naples Federico II, Naples, Italy, in 1996 and 2000, respectively.","In 1997, he joined the Nuclear Fusion Laboratory, JET, Culham, U.K. From 1998 to 2002, he was with the Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Naples Federico II.

In the past, this behavior has been theoretically predicted and experimentally observed, but only for a certain class of CNTs, with short lengths (up to some micrometers) and in a limited range of temperature. This paper demonstrates the possibility of obtaining such a desirable behavior in a larger scale (up to fractions of millimeters). An accurate electrothermal model is used to define the conditions under which a negative derivative of the resistance may be observed. Then, a novel bottom-up technique is proposed to realize the interconnect, by self-assembly of short CNTs. The experimental results of an electrothermal characterization demonstrate the possibility of obtaining a negative temperature coefficient of the resistance and confirm the validity of the theoretical model.","doi":"10.1109/TCPMT.2016.2643007","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Components, Packaging and Manufacturing Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/5503870/7903751/07827047.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCPMT.2016.2643007","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7903751","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Components, Packaging and Manufacturing Technology","startPage":"485","endPage":"493","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 January 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Modeling, Fabrication, and Characterization of Large Carbon Nanotube Interconnects With Negative Temperature Coefficient of the Resistance","volume":"7","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/7827047/","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"16823668","publicationDate":"April 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7827047/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2017","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Graphene-Based Revolutions in ICT and Beyond project","grantNumber":"604391 and FP7-ICT-2013-FET-F"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modeling, Fabrication, and Characterization of Large Carbon Nanotube Interconnects With Negative Temperature Coefficient of the Resistance","sourcePdf":"tcpmt-maffucci-2643007-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.101764S","chronDate":"April  2017","xplore-pub-id":"5503870","isNumber":"7903751","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5503870","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"7903751","articleId":"7827047","onlineDate":"19 January 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7827048,"authors":[{"name":"Patrick M.

Conventional actuators for manufacturing applications have difficulty satisfying design requirements for high-speed locomotion, such as the need for high torque density and the ability to manage dynamic physical interactions. To address this challenge, this paper suggests a proprioceptive actuation paradigm that enables highly dynamic performance in legged machines. Proprioceptive actuation uses collocated force control at the joints to effectively control contact interactions at the feet under dynamic conditions. Modal analysis of a reduced leg model and dimensional analysis of DC motors address the main principles for implementation of this paradigm. In the realm of legged machines, this paradigm provides a unique combination of high torque density, high-bandwidth force control, and the ability to mitigate impacts through backdrivability. We introduce a new metric named the \u201cimpact mitigation factor\u201d (IMF) to quantify backdrivability at impact, which enables design comparison across a wide class of robots. The MIT Cheetah leg is presented, and is shown to have an IMF that is comparable to other quadrupeds with series springs to handle impact. The design enables the Cheetah to control contact forces during dynamic bounding, with contact times down to 85 ms and peak forces over 450 N. The unique capabilities of the MIT Cheetah, achieving impact-robust force-controlled operation in high-speed three-dimensional running and jumping, suggest wider implementation of this holistic actuation approach.","doi":"10.1109/TRO.2016.2640183","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Robotics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Robotics","pdfPath":"/iel7/8860/7938629/07827048.pdf","startPage":"509","endPage":"522","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7938629","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TRO.2016.2640183","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Proprioceptive Actuator Design in the MIT Cheetah: Impact Mitigation and High-Bandwidth Physical Interaction for Dynamic Legged Robots","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7827048","chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/8860/7938629/7827048-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2017","displayDocTitle":"Proprioceptive Actuator Design in the MIT Cheetah: Impact Mitigation and High-Bandwidth Physical Interaction for Dynamic Legged Robots","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7827048/","publicationDate":"June 2017","dateOfInsertion":"05 June 2017","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"16932251","htmlLink":"/document/7827048/","volume":"33","issue":"3","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 January 2017","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000185","fundingName":"DARPA M3 program","grantNumber":"W31P4Q-13-1-0014"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","chorusFlag":"true","title":"Proprioceptive Actuator Design in the MIT Cheetah: Impact Mitigation and High-Bandwidth Physical Interaction for Dynamic Legged Robots","sourcePdf":"tro-wensing-2640183-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.101189S","chronDate":"June  2017","xplore-pub-id":"8860","isNumber":"7938629","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8860","citationCount":"143","xplore-issue":"7938629","articleId":"7827048","onlineDate":"19 January 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-22"},{"_id":7827079,"authors":[{"name":"Zheyu Zhang","affiliation":["Center for Ultra-Wide-Area Resilient Electric Energy Transmission Networks (CURENT), The University of Tennessee, Knoxville, TN, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/8000711/7827079/zhang-2655491-small.gif","p":["Zheyu Zhang (S\u201912\u2013M\u201915) received the B.S. and M.S.\n degrees from Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China, and the Ph.D. degree from The University of\n Tennessee, Knoxville, TN, USA, in 2008, 2011, and 2015, respectively, all in electrical engineering.","He is currently a Research Assistant Professor in the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at\n the University of Tennessee.

Considering the high switching-speed capability of wide band-gap devices, the test results are very sensitive to the alignment of voltage and current (V-I) measurements. Also, because of the shoot-through current induced by Cdv/dt (i.e., cross-talk), the switching losses of the nonoperating switch device in a phase-leg must be considered in addition to the operating device. This paper summarizes the key issues of the DPT, including components and layout design, measurement considerations, grounding effects, and data processing. Additionally, a practical method is proposed for phase-leg switching loss evaluation by calculating the difference between the input energy supplied by a dc capacitor and the output energy stored in a load inductor. Based on a phase-leg power module built with 1200-V/50-A SiC MOSFETs, the test results show that this method can accurately evaluate the switching loss of both the upper and lower switches by detecting only one switching current and voltage, and it is immune to V-I timing misalignment errors.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Methodology for Wide Band-Gap Device Dynamic Characterization","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2017.2655491","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/63/8000711/07827079.pdf","startPage":"9307","endPage":"9318","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2017.2655491","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8000711","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7827079","chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/63/8000711/7827079-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7827079/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 January 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2017","displayDocTitle":"Methodology for Wide Band-Gap Device Dynamic Characterization","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"32","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/7827079/","dateOfInsertion":"09 August 2017","publicationDate":"Dec. 2017","accessionNumber":"17081477","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"National Science Foundation"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000015","fundingName":"DOE"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"NSF","grantNumber":"EEC-1041877"},{"fundingName":"CURENT Industry Partnership Program"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","chorusFlag":"true","title":"Methodology for Wide Band-Gap Device Dynamic Characterization","sourcePdf":"tpel-zhang-2655491-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.170926S","chronDate":"Dec.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"8000711","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"102","xplore-issue":"8000711","articleId":"7827079","onlineDate":"19 January 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7827081,"authors":[{"name":"Jiabing Hu","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Advanced Electromagnetic Engineering and Technology and the School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/60/7931726/7827081/hu-2655540-small.gif","p":["Jiabing Hu (S\u201905\u2013M\u201910\u2013SM\u201912) received\n the B.Eng. and Ph.D. degrees from the College of Electrical Engineering, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China, in July\n 2004 and September 2009, respectively.

First, based on the studied LVRT strategy, the influence of the high-impedance grid is summarized as the interaction between phase-looked loop (PLL) and rotor current controller (RCC). As modal analysis result indicates that the underdamped poles are dominated by PLL, complex torque coefficient method, which is conventionally applied in power system to study the interaction between mechanical and electrical subsystems of synchronous generator, is generalized to analyze how the PLL-RCC interaction influence the phase motion of PLL. Then, the concerned small-signal stability of the PLL-synchronized DFIG system can be discerned by the developed complex phase coefficients. Impacts of PLL's and RCC's parameters are highlighted, as well as the system's operating conditions during LVRT. Finally, the analytical result is validated by experiments.","doi":"10.1109/TEC.2017.2655540","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion","pdfPath":"/iel7/60/7931726/07827081.pdf","startPage":"720","endPage":"730","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7931726","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TEC.2017.2655540","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Small Signal Dynamics of DFIG-Based Wind Turbines During Riding Through Symmetrical Faults in Weak AC Grid","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7827081","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Geoscience"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2017","displayDocTitle":"Small Signal Dynamics of DFIG-Based Wind Turbines During Riding Through Symmetrical Faults in Weak AC Grid","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7827081/","publicationDate":"June 2017","dateOfInsertion":"18 May 2017","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"16898876","htmlLink":"/document/7827081/","volume":"32","issue":"2","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 January 2017","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"National Key Research and Development Program","grantNumber":"2016YFB0900104"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"51277196"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Small Signal Dynamics of DFIG-Based Wind Turbines During Riding Through Symmetrical Faults in Weak AC Grid","sourcePdf":"tec-hu-2655540-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.126628S","chronDate":"June  2017","xplore-pub-id":"60","isNumber":"7931726","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"60","citationCount":"79","xplore-issue":"7931726","articleId":"7827081","onlineDate":"19 January 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-22"},{"_id":7827086,"authors":[{"name":"Alexander Wild","affiliation":["Horst G\u00f6rtz Institute for IT Security, Ruhr-Universit\u00e4t Bochum, Bochum, Germany"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/12/8287085/7827086/wild-2651829-small.gif","p":["Alexander Wild received the diploma degree in electrical engineering\n from Ruhr-Universit\u00e4t Bochum, in 2012 and started the PhD degree in the Chair for Embedded Security, Ruhr\n Universit\u00e4t Bochum, Germany.

In particular, cryptographic hardware circuits need to decorrelate their current consumption from the information inferred by processing (secret) data. A common technique to achieve this goal is the use of special logic styles that aim at equalizing the current consumption at each single processing step. However, since all hiding techniques like Dual-Rail Precharge (DRP) were originally developed for ASICs, the deployment of such countermeasures on FPGA devices with fixed and predefined logic structure poses a particular challenge. In this work, we propose and practically evaluate a new DRP scheme (GliFreD) that has been exclusively designed for FPGA platforms. GliFreD overcomes the well-known early propagation issue, prevents glitches, uses an isolated dual-rail concept, and mitigates imbalanced routings. With all these features, GliFreD significantly exceeds the level of physical security achieved by any previously reported, related countermeasures for FPGAs.","doi":"10.1109/TC.2017.2651829","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel7/12/8287085/07827086.pdf","startPage":"375","endPage":"387","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TC.2017.2651829","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8287085","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7827086","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"GliFreD: Glitch-Free Duplication Towards Power-Equalized Circuits on FPGAs","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"March 1 2018","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 January 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7827086/","displayDocTitle":"GliFreD: Glitch-Free Duplication Towards Power-Equalized Circuits on FPGAs","volume":"67","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/7827086/","publicationDate":"1 March 2018","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"08 February 2018","accessionNumber":"17561832","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Commission of the European Communities","grantNumber":"645622 (PQCRYPTO)"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"GliFreD: Glitch-Free Duplication Towards Power-Equalized Circuits on FPGAs","sourcePdf":"tc-wild-2651829-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.102581S","chronDate":"March 1 2018","xplore-pub-id":"12","isNumber":"8287085","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8287085","articleId":"7827086","onlineDate":"19 January 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7827088,"authors":[{"name":"Yang Long","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Information Engineering in Surveying Mapping and Remote Sensing, Wuhan University, Wuhan, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/36/7880748/7827088/long-2645610-small.gif","p":["Yang Long received the B.S. degree in resources environment and the management of urban and rural planning from Hubei Normal University, Huangshi, China, in 2014.

The two major problems for object localization in remote sensing images caused by the complex context information such images contain are achieving generalizability of the features used to describe objects and achieving accurate object locations. To address these challenges, we propose a new object localization framework, which can be divided into three processes: region proposal, classification, and accurate object localization process. First, a region proposal method is used to generate candidate regions with the aim of detecting all objects of interest within these images. Then, generic image features from a local image corresponding to each region proposal are extracted by a combination model of 2-D reduction convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Finally, to improve the location accuracy, we propose an unsupervised score-based bounding box regression (USB-BBR) algorithm, combined with a nonmaximum suppression algorithm to optimize the bounding boxes of regions that detected as objects. Experiments show that the dimension-reduction model performs better than the retrained and fine-tuned models and the detection precision of the combined CNN model is much higher than that of any single model. Also our proposed USB-BBR algorithm can more accurately locate objects within an image. Compared with traditional features extraction methods, such as elliptic Fourier transform-based histogram of oriented gradients and local binary pattern histogram Fourier, our proposed localization framework shows robustness when dealing with different complex backgrounds.","doi":"10.1109/TGRS.2016.2645610","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7880748","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2016.2645610","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel7/36/7880748/07827088.pdf","startPage":"2486","endPage":"2498","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Accurate Object Localization in Remote Sensing Images Based on Convolutional Neural Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 January 2017","displayDocTitle":"Accurate Object Localization in Remote Sensing Images Based on Convolutional Neural Networks","volume":"55","issue":"5","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2017","dateOfInsertion":"06 May 2019","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7827088/","isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"May 2017","accessionNumber":"16756605","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7827088/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100012166","fundingName":"National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program)","grantNumber":"2016YFB0502602"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Accurate Object Localization in Remote Sensing Images Based on Convolutional Neural Networks","sourcePdf":"tgrs-xiao-2645610-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.141001S","chronDate":"May  2017","xplore-pub-id":"36","isNumber":"7880748","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"235","xplore-issue":"7880748","articleId":"7827088","onlineDate":"19 January 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":7827091,"authors":[{"name":"Bin Zhong","affiliation":["School of Information and Electrical Engineering, Hunan University of Science and Technology, Xiangtan, China"],"firstName":"Bin","lastName":"Zhong","orcid":"0000-0002-3450-5424","id":"38667256400"},{"name":"Zhongshan Zhang","affiliation":["Beijing Engineering and Technology Research Center for Convergence Networks and Ubiquitous Services, University of Science and Technology Beijing, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Zhongshan","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37279639900"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-7798"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2558"},{"format":"CD","value":"2373-7891"}],"articleNumber":"7827091","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":39,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1041},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7827091","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Relays","Signal to noise ratio","High definition video","Closed-form solutions","Interference cancellation","Receivers"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cooperative communication networks","full-duplex relaying","two-way relay selection","decode-and-forward"]}],"abstract":"The secrecy outage probability (SOP) of cooperative communication systems with optimal relay selection (ORS) scheme in the presence of an eavesdropper is investigated by implementing decode-and-forward-based full-duplex (FD) two-way relayingmode.

Furthermore, the closed-form expression for the exact SOP of the proposed ORS scheme is given out.

In particular, the impact of residual SI is shown to be more obvious in terms of eroding the system\u2019s secrecy performance in a low-to-medium SNR regime than in a high-SNR regime.

This paper aims to show that the method is effective to analyze nonlinear dynamics and bifurcations in memristor circuits with more complex dynamics including Hopf bifurcations (originating persistent oscillations) and period-doubling cascades (leading to chaotic behavior). One key feature of the method is that it makes clear how initial conditions give rise to bifurcations for an otherwise fixed set of circuit parameters.

The sampling rate offset (SRO) is precisely modeled as a time scaling. The applicability of a wideband correlation processor for estimating the SRO, even in a reverberant and multiple source environment, is presented. An explicit expression for the ambiguity function, which in our case involves time scaling of the received signals, is derived by applying truncated band-limited interpolation. We then propose the recursive band-limited interpolation (RBI) algorithm for recursive SRO estimation. A complete resynchronization scheme utilizing the RBI algorithm, in parallel with the SRO compensation module, is presented. The resulting resynchronization method operates in the time domain in a sequential manner and is, thus, capable of tracking a potentially time-varying SRO. We compared the performance of the proposed RBI algorithm to other available methods in a simulation study. The importance of resynchronization in a beamforming application is demonstrated by both a simulation study and experiments with a real WASN.

Considering this situation, we have developed a novel assembly task co-worker robot to support workers in their task by delivering the parts and tools to workers. Although such systems have improved work efficiency by predicting human's motion patterns, it is necessary to collect worker's data in advance and regenerate its model whenever the worker is changed. In this letter, we extend the previous system by installing an online learning algorithm and create a worker-dependent model without collecting data in advance. Trajectory prediction with high precision can be realized because of the worker-dependent model and effective utilization of the regularity of the worker's behavior. An adaptive task scheduling system based on the predicted result of the worker's behavior is proposed for improving work efficiency. Implementing the proposed algorithm, we evaluate the effectiveness of the task scheduling system by experiment.","doi":"10.1109/LRA.2017.2655565","publicationTitle":"IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/7083369/7797562/07827110.pdf","startPage":"856","endPage":"863","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LRA.2017.2655565","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7797562","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive Task Scheduling for an Assembly Task Coworker Robot Based on Incremental Learning of Human's Motion Patterns","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 January 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7827110/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2017","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive Task Scheduling for an Assembly Task Coworker Robot Based on Incremental Learning of Human's Motion Patterns","dateOfInsertion":"07 February 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7827110/","accessionNumber":"16648575","volume":"2","issue":"2","isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"April 2017","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Adaptive Task Scheduling for an Assembly Task Coworker Robot Based on Incremental Learning of Human's Motion Patterns","sourcePdf":"lra-kanazawa-2655565-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.080883S","chronDate":"April  2017","xplore-pub-id":"7083369","isNumber":"7797562","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7083369","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"7797562","articleId":"7827110","onlineDate":"19 January 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7827111,"authors":[{"name":"Jawad Mirza","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, COMSATS Institute of Information Technology, Islamabad, Pakistan"],"firstName":"Jawad","lastName":"Mirza","orcid":"0000-0001-8129-321X","id":"38522384100"},{"name":"Bakhtiar Ali","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, COMSATS Institute of Information Technology, Islamabad, Pakistan"],"firstName":"Bakhtiar","lastName":"Ali","id":"37085403455"},{"name":"Syed Saud Naqvi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, COMSATS Institute of Information Technology, Islamabad, Pakistan"],"firstName":"Syed","lastName":"Saud Naqvi","id":"37086008116"},{"name":"Saqib Saleem","affiliation":["COMSATS Institute of Information Technology, Sahiwal, Pakistan"],"firstName":"Saqib","lastName":"Saleem","id":"37086008276"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-7798"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2558"},{"format":"CD","value":"2373-7891"}],"articleNumber":"7827111","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":18,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1134},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7827111","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Precoding","Radio frequency","Matching pursuit algorithms","Baseband","MIMO","Algorithm design and analysis","Transmitters"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["MIMO","hybrid beamforming","limited feedback"]}],"abstract":"We propose a hybrid precoding design for spatial multiplexing in millimeter wave massive multiple-input multiple-output systems.

Inspired by deep learning technology, a novel deep supervised and contractive neural network (DSCNN) for SAR image classification is proposed to overcome these problems. In order to extract spatial features, a multiscale patch-based feature extraction model that consists of gray level-gradient co-occurrence matrix, Gabor, and histogram of oriented gradient descriptors is developed to obtain primitive features from the SAR image. Then, to get discriminative representation of initial features, the DSCNN network that comprises four layers of supervised and contractive autoencoders is proposed to optimize features for classification. The supervised penalty of the DSCNN can capture the relevant information between features and labels, and the contractive restriction aims to enhance the locally invariant and robustness of the encoding representation. Consequently, the DSCNN is able to produce effective representation of sample features and provide superb predictions of the class labels. Moreover, to restrain the influence of speckle noises, a graph-cut-based spatial regularization is adopted after classification to suppress misclassified pixels and smooth the results. Experiments on three SAR data sets demonstrate that the proposed method is able to yield superior classification performance compared with some related approaches.","doi":"10.1109/TGRS.2016.2645226","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7864502","startPage":"2442","endPage":"2459","pdfPath":"/iel7/36/7864502/07827114.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2016.2645226","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Deep Supervised and Contractive Neural Network for SAR Image Classification","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Synthetic aperture radar","Feature extraction","Transforms","Speckle","Robustness","Decoding","Machine learning"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feature extraction","geophysical image processing","gradient methods","image classification","learning (artificial intelligence)","matrix algebra","neural nets","radar imaging","remote sensing by radar","synthetic aperture radar"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["novel deep supervised and contractive neural network","SAR image classification","synthetic aperture radar image","DSCNN","spatial feature extraction","multiscale patch-based feature extraction model","gray level-gradient co-occurrence matrix","histogram of oriented gradient descriptors","Gabor model","graph-cut-based spatial regularization"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Contractive autoencoder (AE)","deep neural network (DNN)","supervised classification","synthetic aperture radar (SAR) image"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2017","displayDocTitle":"Deep Supervised and Contractive Neural Network for SAR Image Classification","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7827114/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 January 2017","dateOfInsertion":"24 February 2017","volume":"55","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/7827114/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"16706626","publicationDate":"April 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Nature Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61671103"},{"fundingName":"High Resolution Special Research","grantNumber":"41-Y30B12-9001-14/16"},{"fundingName":"National\u2019s Key Project of Research and Development Plan","grantNumber":"2016YFC1401007"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Deep Supervised and Contractive Neural Network for SAR Image Classification","sourcePdf":"tgrs-geng-2645226-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.127064S","chronDate":"April  2017","xplore-pub-id":"36","isNumber":"7864502","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"77","xplore-issue":"7864502","articleId":"7827114","onlineDate":"19 January 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":7827117,"authors":[{"name":"Huang-Chia Shih","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Yuan Ze University, Taoyuan, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/76/8353822/7827117/shih-2655624-small.gif","p":["Huang-Chia Shih received the B.S. degree, with the highest honors, in electronic engineering from the National Taipei University of Technology, Taipei, Taiwan in 2000, and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering (EE) from the National Tsing Hua University in 2002 and 2008, respectively.","He joined the faculty at the Yuan Ze University (YZU) in 2010, where he is currently an Associate Professor in the EE Department.

Previous surveys have focused on the methodologies of sports video analysis from the spatiotemporal viewpoint instead of a content-based viewpoint, and few of these studies have considered semantics. This paper develops a deeper interpretation of content-aware sports video analysis by examining the insight offered by research into the structure of content under different scenarios. On the basis of this insight, we provide an overview of the themes particularly relevant to the research on content-aware systems for broadcast sports. Specifically, we focus on the video content analysis techniques applied in sportscasts over the past decade from the perspectives of fundamentals and general review, a content hierarchical model, and trends and challenges. Content-aware analysis methods are discussed with respect to object-, event-, and context-oriented groups. In each group, the gap between sensation and content excitement must be bridged using proper strategies. In this regard, a content-aware approach is required to determine user demands. Finally, this paper summarizes the future trends and challenges for sports video analysis.

The method is demonstrated using inhomogeneous samples composed of a resin containing micrometric inclusions of a known ceramic material. The SMM suitable for this task employs relatively large tips (tens of micrometers in diameter). Additionally, in order to make the instrument more suitable for high-throughput analysis, an original design for rapid tip changes is implemented. Single-point measurements of dielectric constant at random locations on the sample were performed, leading to histograms of dielectric constant values. These are related to the dielectric constants of the two phases using Maxwell-Garnett effective medium theory, taking into account the volume-of-interaction in the sample beneath the tip.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Dielectrics","Microwave theory and techniques","Microscopy","Microwave measurement","Calibration","Permittivity","Resonant frequency"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["microwave measurement","permittivity measurement","scanning probe microscopy","statistical analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["statistical description","inhomogeneous sample","scanning microwave microscopy","multiphase sample dielectric properties","resin containing micrometric inclusions","ceramic material","single point measurements","dielectric constant","Maxwell-Garnett effective medium theory"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Dielectric constant","dielectric materials","Maxwell\u2013Garnett approximation","microwave measurements","near-field measurements","nonhomogeneous media","scanning microwave microscope (SMM)","statistical distributions"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TMTT.2016.2642940","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel7/22/7938544/07827118.pdf","startPage":"2162","endPage":"2170","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7938544","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMTT.2016.2642940","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Statistical Description of Inhomogeneous Samples by Scanning Microwave Microscopy","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7827118","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Statistical Description of Inhomogeneous Samples by Scanning Microwave Microscopy","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7827118/","volume":"65","issue":"6","publicationDate":"June 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7827118/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"16915030","dateOfInsertion":"05 June 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 January 2017","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Statistical Description of Inhomogeneous Samples by Scanning Microwave Microscopy","sourcePdf":"tmtt-monti-2642940-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.077642S","chronDate":"June  2017","xplore-pub-id":"22","isNumber":"7938544","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7938544","articleId":"7827118","onlineDate":"19 January 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":7827121,"authors":[{"name":"Liang Wu","affiliation":["City University of Hong Kong Shenzhen Research Institute, Shenzhen, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8919/7934110/7827121/wu-2649844-small.gif","p":["Liang Wu received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in materials science from Fudan University, China, in 2004 and 2007 respectively, and the Ph.D. degree in electronic and computer engineering from the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, China, in 2012.","From March 2013, he was with the Department of Electronic and Computer Engineering at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology as a Research Assistant Professor.

The working principle of conventional LNAs using transformers is analyzed to show their underlying performance trade-off between input matching and noise figure (NF). To mitigate this issue, a new feedback technique is developed by constructing a drain-to-gate feedback path around the input transistor with a transformer and then further demonstrated by two LNA prototypes. In the first LNA aiming for software-defined radio (SDR) applications, the proposed technique not only achieves wideband input matching but also enables noise cancellation through an auxiliary out-of-phase forward path.

This paper studies centralized user association and spectrum allocation across many access points in such a heterogeneous network. Such centralized control is on a relatively slow timescale to allow information exchange and joint optimization over multiple cells. This is in contrast and complementary to distributed scheduling on a fast timescale. A queueing model is introduced to capture the lower spectral efficiency, reliability, and additional delays of data transmission over the unlicensed bands due to contention and/or listen-before-talk requirements. Two optimization-based spectrum allocation schemes are proposed along with efficient algorithms for computing the allocations. The proposed solutions take into account traffic loads, network topology, as well as external interference levels in the unlicensed bands. Packet-level simulation results show that the proposed schemes significantly outperform orthogonal and full-frequency-reuse allocations under all traffic conditions.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2017.2655518","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2017.2655518","startPage":"1815","endPage":"1827","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/7900485/07827124.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7900485","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Licensed and Unlicensed Spectrum Allocation in Heterogeneous Networks","chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/26/7900485/7827124-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7827124/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 January 2017","displayDocTitle":"Licensed and Unlicensed Spectrum Allocation in Heterogeneous Networks","volume":"65","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"14 April 2017","accessionNumber":"16808416","publicationDate":"April 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7827124/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Futurewei Technologies"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"CCF-1423040"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","chorusFlag":"true","title":"Licensed and Unlicensed Spectrum Allocation in Heterogeneous Networks","sourcePdf":"tcomm-zhou-2655518-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.127134S","chronDate":"April  2017","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"7900485","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"7900485","articleId":"7827124","onlineDate":"19 January 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7827126,"authors":[{"name":"Christopher Lehnert","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Queensland University of Technology, Brisbane, QLD, Australia"],"firstName":"Christopher","lastName":"Lehnert","id":"37546443200"},{"name":"Andrew English","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Queensland University of Technology, Brisbane, QLD, Australia"],"firstName":"Andrew","lastName":"English","id":"37085401616"},{"name":"Christopher McCool","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Queensland University of Technology, Brisbane, QLD, Australia"],"firstName":"Christopher","lastName":"McCool","id":"38274733400"},{"name":"Adam W.

Their degradation is usually evaluated by an increase of the internal resistance or a decrease of the equivalent capacitance. These aging indicators have a good correlation with the supercapacitor's state-of-health (SoH). Generally, SoH is measured by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). However, this technique must be performed offline and requires interruption of the system's operation. In this paper, a sliding mode observer is designed to estimate online the EDLC's aging indicators. Unlike several online estimators, the supercapacitor's parameters are considered as a nonlinear random distribution with external noises which yields accurate estimation. In addition, the relationship between the capacitance and the bias voltage is considered to be nonlinear. Lyapunov stability analysis is also provided. The proposed approach is validated experimentally using a standardized dynamic current profile. Furthermore, comparison against EIS is carried out for different aging phases and under different environmental temperature conditions.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7827142/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 January 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2017","volume":"32","issue":"12","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"03 August 2017","accessionNumber":"17081501","publicationDate":"Dec. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7827142/","displayDocTitle":"Online Parameter Identification for Supercapacitor State-of-Health Diagnosis for Vehicular Applications","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Online Parameter Identification for Supercapacitor State-of-Health Diagnosis for Vehicular Applications","sourcePdf":"tpel-gualous-2655578-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.099741S","chronDate":"Dec.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"8000711","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"35","xplore-issue":"8000711","articleId":"7827142","onlineDate":"19 January 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-25"},{"_id":7827145,"authors":[{"name":"Feng Yin","affiliation":["Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen Research Institute of Big Data, Guangdong, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/7845749/7827145/yin-2655480-small.gif","p":["Feng Yin (M\u201914) received the B.Sc. degree from Shanghai Jiao\n Tong University, Shanghai, China, in 2008, the M.Sc. and Dr.-Ing. degrees from Technische Universit\u00e4t Darmstadt,\n Darmstadt, Germany, in 2011 and 2014, respectively.

The proposed framework contains five main building blocks, namely the deployment information, RSS model, positioning metric selection, optimization process and management. Among others, we focus on Gaussian process regression (GPR)-based RSS models and positioning metric computation. The optimal RSS threshold is found through minimizing the best achievable localization root-mean-square-error formulated with the aid of fundamental lower bound analysis. Computational complexity is compared for different RSS models and different fundamental lower bounds. The resulting optimal RSS threshold enables enhanced performance of new fashioned low-cost and low-complex proximity report-based positioning algorithms. The proposed framework is validated with real measurements collected in an office area where bluetooth-low-energy (BLE) beacons are deployed.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and

Breast arterial calcifications (BACs), detected in mammograms, can be useful risk markers associated with the disease. We investigate the feasibility of automated and accurate detection of BACs in mammograms for risk assessment of coronary artery disease. We develop a 12-layer convolutional neural network to discriminate BAC from non-BAC and apply a pixelwise, patch-based procedure for BAC detection. To assess the performance of the system, we conduct a reader study to provide ground-truth information using the consensus of human expert radiologists. We evaluate the performance using a set of 840 full-field digital mammograms from 210 cases, using both free-response receiver operating characteristic (FROC) analysis and calcium mass quantification analysis. The FROC analysis shows that the deep learning approach achieves a level of detection similar to the human experts. The calcium mass quantification analysis shows that the inferred calcium mass is close to the ground truth, with a linear regression between them yielding a coefficient of determination of 96.24%. Taken together, these results suggest that deep learning can be used effectively to develop an automated system for BAC detection in mammograms to help identify and assess patients with cardiovascular risks.","chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/42/7915815/7827150-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7827150/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 January 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2017","volume":"36","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"01 May 2017","publicationDate":"May 2017","accessionNumber":"16850356","pubMedId":"28113340","htmlLink":"/document/7827150/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Detecting Cardiovascular Disease from Mammograms With Deep Learning","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"IIS-1550705"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100006785","fundingName":"Google Faculty Research Award under Grant"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000050","fundingName":"National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (Bethesda, MD) to CI and SM","grantNumber":"R01 HL106043"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","chorusFlag":"true","title":"Detecting Cardiovascular Disease from Mammograms With Deep Learning","sourcePdf":"tmi-baldi-2655486-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.119058S","chronDate":"May  2017","xplore-pub-id":"42","isNumber":"7915815","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"42","citationCount":"92","xplore-issue":"7915815","articleId":"7827150","onlineDate":"19 January 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":7827160,"authors":[{"name":"Jun Shi","affiliation":["Shanghai University, Shanghai, Shanghai, CN"],"firstName":"Jun","lastName":"Shi","id":"37085456006"},{"name":"Xiao Zheng","affiliation":["Shanghai University, Shanghai, Shanghai, CN"],"firstName":"Xiao","lastName":"Zheng","id":"37086006762"},{"name":"Yan Li","affiliation":["Shenzhen University, Shenzhen, Guangdong, CN"],"firstName":"Yan","lastName":"Li","id":"37088324561"},{"name":"Qi Zhang","affiliation":["Shanghai University, Shanghai, Shanghai, CN"],"firstName":"Qi","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37594267100"},{"name":"Shihui Ying","affiliation":["Shanghai University, Shanghai, Shanghai, CN"],"firstName":"Shihui","lastName":"Ying","orcid":"0000-0001-9423-0146","id":"37943249200"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2168-2194"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2168-2208"}],"articleNumber":"7827160","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":58,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":4816},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neuroimaging","Feature extraction","Classification algorithms","Magnetic resonance imaging","Prediction algorithms","Diseases","Positron emission tomography"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biomedical MRI","cognition","diseases","image classification","learning (artificial intelligence)","medical image processing","neurophysiology","polynomials","positron emission tomography"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feature learning","multimodal stacked deep polynomial networks","Alzheimer disease diagnosis","mild cognitive impairment","multimodal neuroimaging data","magnetic resonance imaging","positron emission tomography","AD diagnosis","deep polynomial networks","deep learning algorithm","multimodal stacked DPN algorithm","MM-SDPN algorithm","feature representation","to fed high-level features","MRI","PET","ADNI dataset","binary classification","multiclass classification","state-of-the-art multimodal feature-learning-based algorithm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Alzheimer's disease","deep learning","deep polynomial networks","multimodal stacked deep polynomial networks","multimodal neuroimaging"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Algorithms","Alzheimer Disease","Humans","Machine Learning","Multimodal Imaging","Neural Networks, Computer","Neuroimaging","ROC Curve"]}],"abstract":"The accurate diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and its early stage, i.e., mild cognitive impairment, is essential for timely treatment and possible delay of AD. Fusion of multimodal neuroimaging data, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and positron emission tomography (PET), has shown its effectiveness for AD diagnosis. The deep polynomial networks (DPN) is a recently proposed deep learning algorithm, which performs well on both large-scale and small-size datasets. In this study, a multimodal stacked DPN (MM-SDPN) algorithm, which MM-SDPN consists of two-stage SDPNs, is proposed to fuse and learn feature representation from multimodal neuroimaging data for AD diagnosis. Specifically speaking, two SDPNs are first used to learn high-level features of MRI and PET, respectively, which are then fed to another SDPN to fuse multimodal neuroimaging information. The proposed MM-SDPN algorithm is applied to the ADNI dataset to conduct both binary classification and multiclass classification tasks. Experimental results indicate that MM-SDPN is superior over the state-of-the-art multimodal feature-learning-based algorithms for AD diagnosis.","doi":"10.1109/JBHI.2017.2655720","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics","pdfPath":"/iel7/6221020/8245219/07827160.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JBHI.2017.2655720","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8245219","startPage":"173","endPage":"183","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multimodal Neuroimaging Feature Learning With Multimodal Stacked Deep Polynomial Networks for Diagnosis of Alzheimer's Disease","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7827160","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Multimodal Neuroimaging Feature Learning With Multimodal Stacked Deep Polynomial Networks for Diagnosis of Alzheimer's Disease","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7827160/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 January 2017","isJournal":true,"volume":"22","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2018","accessionNumber":"17436352","pubMedId":"28113353","dateOfInsertion":"03 January 2018","htmlLink":"/document/7827160/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61471231, 81627804, 61401267, U1201256, 61471245 and 11471208"},{"fundingName":"Projects of Guangdong R/D Foundation and the Fundamental Science Projects of Shenzhen City","grantNumber":"JCYJ20140418091413514, ZDSYS20140508141148477 and JCYJ20160308095019383"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multimodal Neuroimaging Feature Learning With Multimodal Stacked Deep Polynomial Networks for Diagnosis of Alzheimer's Disease","sourcePdf":"jbhi-ying-2655720-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.114891S","chronDate":"Jan.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"6221020","isNumber":"8245219","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6221020","citationCount":"58","xplore-issue":"8245219","articleId":"7827160","onlineDate":"19 January 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-22"},{"_id":7827161,"authors":[{"name":"Mihai-Alin Badiu","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Systems, Aalborg University, Aalborg, Denmark"],"bio":{"p":["Mihai-Alin Badiu received the Dipl.-Ing., M.S., and Ph.D. degrees in\n electrical engineering from the Technical University of Cluj-Napoca, Cluj-Napoca, Romania, in 2008, 2010, and 2012,\n respectively.

We target model order and parameter estimation via variational inference in a probabilistic model in which the frequencies are continuous-valued, i.e., not restricted to a grid; and the coefficients are governed by a Bernoulli-Gaussian prior model turning model order selection into binary sequence detection. Unlike earlier works which retain only point estimates of the frequencies, we undertake a complete Bayesian treatment by estimating the posterior probability density functions (pdfs) of the frequencies and computing expectations over them. Thus, we additionally capture and operate with the uncertainty of the frequency estimates. Aiming to maximize the model evidence, variational optimization provides analytic approximations of the posterior pdfs and also gives estimates of the additional parameters. We propose an accurate representation of the frequency pdfs by mixtures of von Mises pdfs, which yields closed-form expectations. We define the algorithm VALSE in which the estimates of the pdfs and parameters are iteratively updated. VALSE is a gridless, convergent method, does not require parameter tuning, can easily include prior knowledge about the frequencies and provides approximate posterior pdfs based on which the uncertainty in line spectral estimation can be quantified. Simulation results show that accounting for the uncertainty of frequency estimates, rather than computing just point estimates, significantly improves the performance. The performance of VALSE is superior to that of state-of-the-art methods and closely approaches the Cram\u00e9r-Rao bound computed for the true model order.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2017.2655489","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/78/7858803/07827161.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7858803","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2017.2655489","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","startPage":"2247","endPage":"2261","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Variational Bayesian Inference of Line Spectra","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7827161","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"May1, 1 2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 January 2017","displayDocTitle":"Variational Bayesian Inference of Line Spectra","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7827161/","volume":"65","issue":"9","htmlLink":"/document/7827161/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"1 May1, 2017","accessionNumber":"16690248","dateOfInsertion":"17 February 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"VIRTUOSO"},{"fundingName":"Intel Mobile Communications"},{"fundingName":"Anite"},{"fundingName":"Telenor"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002702","fundingName":"Aalborg University"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100008617","fundingName":"Danish National Advanced Technology Foundation"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004836","fundingName":"Danish Council for Independent Research","grantNumber":"DFF\u20135054-00212 and DFF\u20134005-00549"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Variational Bayesian Inference of Line Spectra","sourcePdf":"tsp-badiu-2655489-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.120092S","chronDate":"May1, 1 2017","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"7858803","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"28","xplore-issue":"7858803","articleId":"7827161","onlineDate":"19 January 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7827162,"authors":[{"name":"Tianyi Zhou","affiliation":["Laboratory of Applied Research on Electromagnetics, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/22/7963873/7827162/zhou-2642106-small.gif","p":["Tianyi Zhou received the B.S. degree in information and communication engineering from Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China, in 2013, where he is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree at the Laboratory of Applied Research on Electromagnetics.","His current research interests include microwave imaging and wireless localization."]},"firstName":"Tianyi","lastName":"Zhou","id":"37085657872"},{"name":"Huan Li","affiliation":["Laboratory of Applied Research on Electromagnetics, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/22/7963873/7827162/hli-2642106-small.gif","p":["Huan Li received the B.S. degree from Xidian University, Xi\u2019an, China, in 2011.

In this paper, we propose a new approach for short-range wireless localization based on meta-aperture and compressed sensing (CS). Utilizing the plasmonic dispersion of a magnetically uniaxial metamaterial, a pushpin-shaped autocorrelation characteristic of the localization system can be obtained to ensure high localization precision. Compared with existing realizations based on traveling wave excited, randomly arranged subwavelength resonant elements, our method uses a homogeneous aperture for the generation of randomized illumination. Based on the CS, localization can be obtained with much less data and much faster data processing than conventional methods. Simulation and experimental investigation are conducted, and the results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. With the simple implementation for fast localization, our method has promising potential in practical applications.","doi":"10.1109/TMTT.2016.2642106","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel7/22/7963873/07827162.pdf","startPage":"2516","endPage":"2524","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMTT.2016.2642106","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7963873","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Short-Range Wireless Localization Based on Meta-Aperture Assisted Compressed Sensing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7827162","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 January 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7827162/","displayDocTitle":"Short-Range Wireless Localization Based on Meta-Aperture Assisted Compressed Sensing","volume":"65","issue":"7","publicationDate":"July 2017","accessionNumber":"16993454","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7827162/","dateOfInsertion":"30 June 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"NSFC","grantNumber":"61131002, 61528104, 61471315 and 61071063"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004731","fundingName":"ZJNSF","grantNumber":"LY16F010009"},{"fundingName":"SCST","grantNumber":"2016JY0145"},{"fundingName":"Program for the Top Young Innovative Talents","grantNumber":"Q1313-03"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Short-Range Wireless Localization Based on Meta-Aperture Assisted Compressed Sensing","sourcePdf":"tmtt-ye-2642106-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.112819S","chronDate":"July  2017","xplore-pub-id":"22","isNumber":"7963873","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"7963873","articleId":"7827162","onlineDate":"19 January 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7827164,"authors":[{"name":"Chun Li","affiliation":["Hydro One Networks, Inc., Toronto, ON, Canada"],"firstName":"Chun","lastName":"Li","orcid":"0000-0003-3462-1748","id":"38239032600"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0885-8977"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1937-4208"}],"articleNumber":"7827164","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":50,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1945},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Power & Energy Society","url":"http://www.ieee.org/portal/index.jsp?pageID=pes_home"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Inverters","Harmonic analysis","Oscillators","Photovoltaic systems","Standards"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["invertors","photovoltaic power systems","power grids","power system stability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["photovoltaic inverter","grid codes","photovoltaic generation integration","grid-connected photovoltaic generation plants","power system stability"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Photovoltaic inverter","harmonics","instability","power quality","distributed energy resources"]}],"abstract":"This letter presents records of unstable operations in grid-connected photovoltaic generation plants.

The time-domain vibration signals of rolling bearings with different fault conditions are preprocessed using differential evolution method, then further being trained by Levenberg Marquardt method. The processed data are applied as input vectors to artificial neural networks (ANNs) for rolling bearing fault classification. The hybrid training method overcomes the defects of network training, for example lower convergence speed of evolutionary artificial neural network and easiness of falling into local minimum. And it also has the advantages of quick convergence speed and good global continuous optimization ability. In addition, probabilistic adaptive strategy which could save computation time in various situations is adopted. The proposed method is applied to the rolling bearings faults diagnosis, and compared with other training methods. The results for both real and simulated bearing vibration data show that, high correct classification rate were obtained through LM, and the presented method demonstrated rapid convergence and good stability than traditional method such as LM and other methods. The probabilistic adaptive strategy improved the convergence rate and obtained higher correct rate.","doi":"10.1109/M2VIP.2016.7827265","pdfPath":"/iel7/7801400/7827253/07827265.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 23rd International Conference on Mechatronics and Machine Vision in Practice (M2VIP)","publicationTitle":"2016 23rd International Conference on Mechatronics and Machine Vision in Practice (M2VIP)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/M2VIP.2016.7827265","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7827253","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Application of new training method combined with feedforward artificial neural network for rolling bearing fault diagnosis","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7827265/","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-30 Nov. 2016","displayDocTitle":"Application of new training method combined with feedforward artificial neural network for rolling bearing fault diagnosis","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"23 January 2017","accessionNumber":"16618851","publicationDate":"Nov. 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7827265/","conferenceDate":"28-30 Nov. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Application of new training method combined with feedforward artificial neural network for rolling bearing fault diagnosis","confLoc":"Nanjing, China","sourcePdf":"1570300161.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061301S","chronDate":"28-30 Nov. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7801400","isNumber":"7827253","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7801400","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7827253","articleId":"7827265","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":7827266,"authors":[{"name":"Yanjun Liu","affiliation":["Department of Automation, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Yanjun","lastName":"Liu","id":"37086184754"},{"name":"Na Liu","affiliation":["Department of Automation, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Na","lastName":"Liu","id":"37085562480"},{"name":"Hong Huo","affiliation":["Department of Automation, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Hong","lastName":"Huo","id":"37394629100"},{"name":"Tao Fang","affiliation":["Department of Automation, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Tao","lastName":"Fang","id":"37407630600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2764-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2765-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7827266","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":229},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7827266","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Feature extraction","Vehicles","Training","Satellites","Vehicle detection","Image resolution","Backpropagation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feature extraction","geographic information systems","image recognition","neural nets","town and country planning"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["vehicle detection","high resolution satellite images","joint-layer deep convolutional neural networks","city planning","transport management","JLDCNN","complex satellite images","feature extraction","Google Earth"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["deep convolutional neural networks","feature extraction","high resolution satellite images","vehicle detection","pattern recognition"]}],"abstract":"Vehicle detection can provide volumes of useful data for city planning and transport management.

JLDCNNs aim to cover different scales and detect vehicles from complex satellite images rapidly by overcoming the insufficient feature extraction of traditional DCNNs. The model is evaluated and compared with traditional DCNNs and other methods on our challenging dataset which includes 20 high resolution satellite images (including over 2400 vehicles) collected from Google Earth. JLDCNNs significantly improve the precision rate by 16% and the recall rate by 6% compared with traditional DCNNs, let alone outperform other traditional methods.","publicationTitle":"2016 23rd International Conference on Mechatronics and Machine Vision in Practice (M2VIP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 23rd International Conference on Mechatronics and Machine Vision in Practice (M2VIP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7801400/7827253/07827266.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/M2VIP.2016.7827266","doi":"10.1109/M2VIP.2016.7827266","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7827253","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Vehicle detection in high resolution satellite images with joint-layer deep convolutional neural networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Vehicle detection in high resolution satellite images with joint-layer deep convolutional neural networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7827266/","conferenceDate":"28-30 Nov. 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7827266/","dateOfInsertion":"23 January 2017","publicationDate":"Nov. 2016","accessionNumber":"16618793","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-30 Nov. 2016","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Vehicle detection in high resolution satellite images with joint-layer deep convolutional neural networks","confLoc":"Nanjing, China","sourcePdf":"1570300612.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.086195S","chronDate":"28-30 Nov. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7801400","isNumber":"7827253","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7801400","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7827253","articleId":"7827266","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7827307,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaqing Pei","affiliation":["School of Automation Science and Electrical Engineering, Beihang University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Xiaqing","lastName":"Pei","id":"37086004987"},{"name":"Yuanjun Zhou","affiliation":["School of Automation Science and Electrical Engineering, Beihang University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yuanjun","lastName":"Zhou","id":"37874918600"},{"name":"Zhiyu Sheng","affiliation":["School of Automation Science and Electrical Engineering, Beihang University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Zhiyu","lastName":"Sheng","id":"37086002310"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2764-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2765-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7827307","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":147},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7827307","abstract":"Quantum genetic algorithm (QGA) was proved better than the traditional genetic algorithm in numerical and combinatorial optimization problems. However, it was seldom applied to optimize In-Wheel motors. For exerting the advantages of QGA adequately, a new In-Wheel motor which is similar to the transverse-flux permanent magnet motor (TFPMM) is optimized based QGA. Firstly, the structure and working principle of this motor are introduced. Secondly, the motor torque ripple rate model is established and it could be found that the motor permanent magnet size and the air gap size have a great relationship with its torque ripple. Finally, QGA is adopted to optimize the relevant motor sizes and to obtain a lower torque ripple ratio. The results induce the torque ripple ratio could be reduced by 7.5% just after 9 evolutions and the population size is only 5. That means QGA has a fast convergence speed and global optimization capability, therefore it is applicable for optimizing the similar motors.","doi":"10.1109/M2VIP.2016.7827307","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 23rd International Conference on Mechatronics and Machine Vision in Practice (M2VIP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7801400/7827253/07827307.pdf","publicationTitle":"2016 23rd International Conference on Mechatronics and Machine Vision in Practice (M2VIP)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/M2VIP.2016.7827307","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7827253","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Torque ripple suppression of a new in-wheel motor based on quantum genetic algorithm","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Torque","Permanent magnet motors","Reluctance motors","Genetic algorithms","Permanent magnets","Brushless DC motors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["air gaps","combinatorial mathematics","genetic algorithms","numerical analysis","permanent magnet motors","wheels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["torque ripple suppression","in-wheel motor","quantum genetic algorithm","numerical problem","combinatorial optimization problem","QGA problem","permanent magnet size","air gap size"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Quantum Genetic Algorithm (QGA)","torque ripple ratio","In-Wheel motor","transverse-flux permanent magnet motor (TFPMM)","optimzation design"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7827307/","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-30 Nov. 2016","displayDocTitle":"Torque ripple suppression of a new in-wheel motor based on quantum genetic algorithm","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7827307/","publicationDate":"Nov. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"23 January 2017","conferenceDate":"28-30 Nov. 2016","accessionNumber":"16618839","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Torque ripple suppression of a new in-wheel motor based on quantum genetic algorithm","confLoc":"Nanjing, China","sourcePdf":"1570308956.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066641S","chronDate":"28-30 Nov. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7801400","isNumber":"7827253","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7801400","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7827253","articleId":"7827307","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7827573,"authors":[{"name":"Sandeep Kumar Samal","affiliation":["School of ECE, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA"],"firstName":"Sandeep Kumar","lastName":"Samal","id":"37076311500"},{"name":"Deepak Nayak","affiliation":["School of ECE, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA"],"firstName":"Deepak","lastName":"Nayak","id":"37085645572"},{"name":"Motoi Ichihashi","affiliation":["Technology Research, Globalfoundries, Santa Clara, CA"],"firstName":"Motoi","lastName":"Ichihashi","id":"37430412400"},{"name":"Srinivasa Banna","affiliation":["Technology Research, Globalfoundries, Santa Clara, CA"],"firstName":"Srinivasa","lastName":"Banna","id":"37088632509"},{"name":"Sung Kyu Lim","affiliation":["Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, US"],"firstName":"Sung Kyu","lastName":"Lim","id":"37280563100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4503-4466-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3421-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2434"}],"articleNumber":"7827573","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":331},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Integrated circuits","Three-dimensional displays","Two dimensional displays","Tungsten","Degradation","Resistance","Timing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["integrated circuit design","integrated circuit interconnections","network routing","silicon-on-insulator","three-dimensional integrated circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["tier partitioning strategy","back-end-of-line interconnect","BEOL degradation","monolithic 3D IC","routing overhead","delay degradation","tungsten BEOL interconnect","M3D","bottom-tier interconnect","net based partitioning methodology","FDSOI technology","full-chip GDS designs","bottom-tier BEOL resistance"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Monolithic 3D IC","BEOL Degradation","Tier-Aware Partitioning"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we develop tier partitioning strategy to mitigate back-end-of-line (BEOL) interconnect delay degradation and cost issues in monolithic 3D ICs (M3D). First, we study the routing overhead and delay degradation caused by tungsten BEOL interconnect in the bottom-tier of M3D. Our study shows that tungsten BEOL reduces performance by up to 30% at 4\u00d7 resistance increase of bottom-tier interconnect. In addition, the bottom-tier BEOL adds a routing overhead to 3D nets, which is neglected in the state-of-the-art flow. Next, we develop two partitioning methods targeted specifically towards BEOL impact reduction. Our path-based approach identifies critical timing paths and places their cells in the top-tier to reduce the impact of delay degradation and routing overhead. Our net-based partitioning methodology confines the nets with long 2D wirelength into the top-tier to reduce the overall routing demand, and hence the metal layer usage in the bottom-tier. This in turn results in BEOL cost savings. Using a foundry 22nm FDSOI technology and full-chip GDS designs, we achieve tolerance of up to 4\u00d7 increase in the bottom-tier BEOL resistance using our partitioning strategy. In addition, we save up to 3 metal layers in the bottom-tier of our M3D designs with up to 32% power savings over 2D IC for an interconnect dominated benchmark.","doi":"10.1145/2966986.2967080","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Computer-Aided Design (ICCAD)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Computer-Aided Design (ICCAD)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7787013/7827541/07827573.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1145/2966986.2967080","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7827541","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Tier partitioning strategy to mitigate BEOL degradation and cost issues in monolithic 3D ICs","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7827573","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-10 Nov. 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7827573/","displayDocTitle":"Tier partitioning strategy to mitigate BEOL degradation and cost issues in monolithic 3D ICs","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2016","accessionNumber":"16618663","htmlLink":"/document/7827573/","conferenceDate":"7-10 Nov. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"23 January 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Tier partitioning strategy to mitigate BEOL degradation and cost issues in monolithic 3D ICs","confLoc":"Austin, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"10B_1.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061351S","chronDate":"7-10 Nov. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7787013","isNumber":"7827541","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7787013","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"7827541","articleId":"7827573","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ACM","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7827574,"authors":[{"name":"Kyungwook Chang","affiliation":["School of ECE, Georqia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA"],"firstName":"Kyungwook","lastName":"Chang","id":"37085638842"},{"name":"Saurabh Sinha","affiliation":["ARM Inc., Austin, TX"],"firstName":"Saurabh","lastName":"Sinha","id":"37289905800"},{"name":"Brian Cline","affiliation":["ARM Inc., Austin, TX"],"firstName":"Brian","lastName":"Cline","id":"37295628300"},{"name":"Raney Southerland","affiliation":["ARM Inc., Austin, TX"],"firstName":"Raney","lastName":"Southerland","id":"37086033170"},{"name":"Michael Doherty","affiliation":["ARM Inc., Austin, TX"],"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Doherty","id":"37086034707"},{"name":"Greg Yeric","affiliation":["ARM Inc., Austin, TX"],"firstName":"Greg","lastName":"Yeric","id":"37086031260"},{"name":"Sung Kyu Lim","affiliation":["Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, US"],"firstName":"Sung Kyu","lastName":"Lim"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4503-4466-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3421-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2434"}],"articleNumber":"7827574","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":21,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":452},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Integrated circuits","Wires","Three-dimensional displays","Standards","Metals","Pins","Timing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["integrated circuit design","low-power electronics","three-dimensional integrated circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Cascade2D","design-aware partitioning approach","monolithic 3D IC","M3D designs","2D commercial tools","Moore's law","monolithic intertier vias","MIV","buffer insertion","anchor cells","dummy wires","2D design","power savings"]}],"abstract":"Monolithic 3D IC (M3D) can continue to improve power, performance, area and cost beyond traditional Moore's law scaling limitations by leveraging the third-dimension and fine-grained monolithic inter-tier vias (MIVs). Several recent studies present methodologies to implement M3D designs, but most, if not all of these studies implement top and bottom tier separately after partitioning, which results in inaccurate buffer insertion. In this paper, we present a new methodology called `Cascade2D' that utilizes design and micro-architecture insight to partition and implement an M3D design using 2D commercial tools. By modeling MIVs with sets of anchor cells and dummy wires, we implement and optimize both top and bottom tier simultaneously in a single 2D design. M3D designs of a commercial, in-order, 32-bit application processor at the foundry 28nm, 14/16nm and predictive 7nm technology nodes are implemented using this new methodology and we investigate the power, performance and area improvements over 2D designs. Our new methodology consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art M3D design flow with up to 4\u00d7 better power savings. In the best case scenario, M3D designs from the Cascade2D flow show 25% better performance at iso-power and 20% lower power at isoperformance.","doi":"10.1145/2966986.2967013","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Computer-Aided Design (ICCAD)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Computer-Aided Design (ICCAD)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7787013/7827541/07827574.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1145/2966986.2967013","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7827541","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cascade2D: A design-aware partitioning approach to monolithic 3D IC with 2D commercial tools","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7827574","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Cascade2D: A design-aware partitioning approach to monolithic 3D IC with 2D commercial tools","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-10 Nov. 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7827574/","conferenceDate":"7-10 Nov. 2016","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2016","accessionNumber":"16618664","dateOfInsertion":"23 January 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7827574/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cascade2D: A design-aware partitioning approach to monolithic 3D IC with 2D commercial tools","confLoc":"Austin, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"10B_2.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049193S","chronDate":"7-10 Nov. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7787013","isNumber":"7827541","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7787013","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"7827541","articleId":"7827574","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ACM","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7827576,"authors":[{"name":"Robert Wille","affiliation":["Institute for Integrated Circuits, Johannes Kepler University, Linz, Austria"],"firstName":"Robert","lastName":"Wille","id":"37308070900"},{"name":"Bing Li","affiliation":["Institute for Electronic Design Automation, Technical University of Munich, Munich, Germany"],"firstName":"Bing","lastName":"Li","id":"37405870300"},{"name":"Ulf Schlichtmann","affiliation":["Technische Universitat Munchen, Munchen, Bayern, DE"],"firstName":"Ulf","lastName":"Schlichtmann"},{"name":"Rolf Drechsler","affiliation":["Cyber Physical Systems, DFKI GmbH, University of Bremen, Bremen, Germany"],"firstName":"Rolf","lastName":"Drechsler","id":"37276502700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4503-4466-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3421-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2434"}],"articleNumber":"7827576","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":350},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7827576","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Quantum computing","Design automation","Integrated optics","Logic gates","Optical interconnections","Optical signal processing","Integrated circuit modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electronic design automation","lab-on-a-chip","microfluidics","quantum computing","quantum optics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biochips circuit","quantum circuit","computer-aided design","physical boundaries","cost restrictions","beyond CMOS","more than Moore technologies","conventional logic","quantum computation","optical circuits","microfluidic biochips"]}],"doi":"10.1145/2966986.2980099","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Computer-Aided Design (ICCAD)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Computer-Aided Design (ICCAD)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7787013/7827541/07827576.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1145/2966986.2980099","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7827541","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"From biochips to quantum circuits: Computer-aided design for emerging technologies","abstract":"While previous decades have witnessed impressive accomplishments in the design and realization of conventional computing devices, physical boundaries and cost restrictions led to an increasing interest in alternative technologies (often referred to as Beyond CMOS or More than Moore technologies).

A circuit-level simulator for emerging nonvolatile memory based Content-Addressable Memory","abstract":"Ternary Content-Addressable Memory (TCAM) is widely used in networking routers, fully associative caches, search engines, etc. While the conventional SRAM-based TCAM suffers from the poor scalability, the emerging nonvolatile memories (NVM, i.e., MRAM, PCM, and ReRAM) bring evolution for the TCAM design. It effectively reduces the cell size, and makes significant energy reduction and scalability improvement. New applications such as associative processors/accelerators are facilitated by the emergence of the nonvolatile TCAM (nvTCAM). However, nvTCAM design is challenging. In addition to the emerging device's uncertainty, the nvTCAM cell structure is so diverse that it results in a design space too large to explore manually. To tackle these challenges, we propose a circuit-level model and develop a simulation tool, NVSim-CAM, which helps researchers to make early design decisions, and to evaluate device/circuit innovations. The tool is validated by HSPICE simulations and data from fabricated chips. We also present a case study to illustrate how NVSim-CAM benefits the nvTCAM design. In the case study, we propose a novel 3D vertical ReRAM based TCAM cell, the 3DvTCAM. We project the advantages/disadvantages and explore the design space for the proposed cell with NVSim-CAM.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"7-10 Nov. 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7827579/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7827579/","accessionNumber":"16618731","conferenceDate":"7-10 Nov. 2016","publicationDate":"Nov. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"23 January 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"NVSim-CAM: A circuit-level simulator for emerging nonvolatile memory based Content-Addressable Memory","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"NVSim-CAM: A circuit-level simulator for emerging nonvolatile memory based Content-Addressable Memory","confLoc":"Austin, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"1A_2.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.157346S","chronDate":"7-10 Nov. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7787013","isNumber":"7827541","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7787013","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"7827541","articleId":"7827579","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ACM","lastupdate":"2021-10-13"},{"_id":7827584,"authors":[{"name":"Yibo Lin","affiliation":["University of Texas at Austin, Austin, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Yibo","lastName":"Lin","id":"37085342244"},{"name":"Bei Yu","affiliation":["Chinese University of Hong Kong, New Territories, HK"],"firstName":"Bei","lastName":"Yu","id":"38238142500"},{"name":"Xiaoqing Xu","affiliation":["University of Texas at Austin, Austin, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Xiaoqing","lastName":"Xu","id":"37085377170"},{"name":"Jhih-Rong Gao","affiliation":["Cadence Design Systems Inc., Austin, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Jhih-Rong","lastName":"Gao","id":"37963880000"},{"name":"Natarajan Viswanathan","affiliation":["Cadence Design Systems Inc., Austin, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Natarajan","lastName":"Viswanathan","id":"37285288600"},{"name":"Wen-Hao Liu","affiliation":["Cadence Design Systems Inc., Austin, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Wen-Hao","lastName":"Liu","id":"37086069393"},{"name":"Zhuo Li","affiliation":["Cadence Design Systems Inc., Austin, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Zhuo","lastName":"Li","id":"37085521684"},{"name":"Charles J.

Additionally, the usage of multi-bit flip-flops or flop trays to save power creates large cells that further complicate critical design tasks, such as placement. Detailed placement happens to be a key optimization transform, which is repeatedly invoked during the design closure flow to improve design parameters, such as, wirelength, timing, and local wiring congestion. Advanced node designs, with hundreds of thousands of multiple-row cells, require a paradigm change for this critical design closure transform. The traditional approach of fixing multiple-row cells during detailed placement and only optimizing the locations of single-row standard cells can no longer obtain appreciable quality of results. It is imperative to have new techniques that can simultaneously optimize both multiple- and single-row high cell locations during detailed placement. In this paper, we propose a new density-aware detailed placer for heterogeneous-sized netlists. Our approach consists of a chain move scheme that generalizes the movement of heterogeneous-sized cells as well as a nested dynamic programming based approach for wirelength and density optimization. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of these techniques in wirelength minimization and density smoothing compared with the most recent detailed placer for designs with heterogeneous-sized cells.","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Computer-Aided Design (ICCAD)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7787013/7827541/07827584.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Computer-Aided Design (ICCAD)","doi":"10.1145/2966986.2967055","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1145/2966986.2967055","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7827541","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7827584","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"MrDP: Multiple-row detailed placement of heterogeneous-sized cells for advanced nodes","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Pins","Standards","Law","Optimization","Layout","Rails"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dynamic programming","integrated circuit layout"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MrDP","multiple row detailed placement","heterogeneous sized cell","advanced node","multibit flip flops","flop trays","wiring congestion","high cell locations","nested dynamic programming","wirelength optimization","density optimization"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7827584/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-10 Nov. 2016","displayDocTitle":"MrDP: Multiple-row detailed placement of heterogeneous-sized cells for advanced nodes","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7827584/","publicationDate":"Nov. 2016","accessionNumber":"16618740","dateOfInsertion":"23 January 2017","conferenceDate":"7-10 Nov. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"MrDP: Multiple-row detailed placement of heterogeneous-sized cells for advanced nodes","confLoc":"Austin, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"1C_1.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.169507S","chronDate":"7-10 Nov. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7787013","isNumber":"7827541","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7787013","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"7827541","articleId":"7827584","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ACM","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7827586,"authors":[{"name":"Shounak Dhar","affiliation":["University of Texas at Austin"],"firstName":"Shounak","lastName":"Dhar","id":"37086001825"},{"name":"Saurabh Adya","affiliation":["Intel Corp, Santa Clara, CA, US"],"firstName":"Saurabh","lastName":"Adya"},{"name":"Love Singhal","affiliation":["Intel Corp, Santa Clara, CA, US"],"firstName":"Love","lastName":"Singhal"},{"name":"Mahesh A.

To improve the performance and energy-efficiency of the computation-demanding CNN, the FPGA-based acceleration emerges as one of the most attractive alternatives. In this paper we design and implement Caffeine, a hardware/software co-designed library to efficiently accelerate the entire CNN on FPGAs. First, we propose a uniformed convolutional matrix-multiplication representation for both computation-intensive convolutional layers and communication-intensive fully connected (FCN) layers. Second, we design Caffeine with the goal to maximize the underlying FPGA computing and bandwidth resource utilization, with a key focus on the bandwidth optimization by the memory access reorganization not studied in prior work. Moreover, we implement Caffeine in the portable high-level synthesis and provide various hardware/software definable parameters for user configurations. Finally, we also integrate Caffeine into the industry-standard software deep learning framework Caffe. We evaluate Caffeine and its integration with Caffe by implementing VGG16 and AlexNet network on multiple FPGA platforms. Caffeine achieves a peak performance of 365 GOPS on Xilinx KU060 FPGA and 636 GOPS on Virtex7 690t FPGA. This is the best published result to our best knowledge. We achieve more than 100\u00d7 speedup on FCN layers over previous FPGA accelerators. An end-to-end evaluation with Caffe integration shows up to 7.3\u00d7 and 43.5\u00d7 performance and energy gains over Caffe on a 12-core Xeon server, and 1.5\u00d7 better energy-efficiency over the GPU implementation on a medium-sized FPGA (KU060). Performance projections to a system with a high-end FPGA (Virtex7 690t) shows even higher gains.","doi":"10.1145/2966986.2967011","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1145/2966986.2967011","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Computer-Aided Design (ICCAD)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Computer-Aided Design (ICCAD)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7787013/7827541/07827589.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7827541","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Caffeine: Towards uniformed representation and acceleration for deep convolutional neural networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7827589/","conferenceDate":"7-10 Nov. 2016","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-10 Nov. 2016","displayDocTitle":"Caffeine: Towards uniformed representation and acceleration for deep convolutional neural networks","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"23 January 2017","accessionNumber":"16618767","publicationDate":"Nov. 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7827589/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Caffeine: Towards uniformed representation and acceleration for deep convolutional neural networks","confLoc":"Austin, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"2A_1.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.075776S","chronDate":"7-10 Nov. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7787013","isNumber":"7827541","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7787013","citationCount":"79","xplore-issue":"7827541","articleId":"7827589","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ACM","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7827592,"authors":[{"name":"Pai-Yu Chen","affiliation":["Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ, USA"],"firstName":"Pai-Yu","lastName":"Chen","id":"37085344760"},{"name":"Jae-sun Seo","affiliation":["Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ, USA"],"lastName":"Jae-sun Seo","id":"37085457143"},{"name":"Yu Cao","affiliation":["Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ, USA"],"lastName":"Yu Cao","id":"37085461285"},{"name":"Shimeng Yu","affiliation":["Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ, USA"],"firstName":"Shimeng","lastName":"Yu","id":"37085352683"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4503-4466-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3421-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2434"}],"articleNumber":"7827592","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":12,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":873},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7827592","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neurons","Oscillators","Switches","Resistance","Integrated circuit modeling","Time-frequency analysis","Neuromorphics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["metal-insulator transition","neural nets","oscillations","resistive RAM"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compact oscillation neuron","metal-insulator-transition","MIT","neuromorphic computing","resistive synaptic array","resistive RRAM","2-transistor-1-resistor array architecture","2T1R array architecture","neural network"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Metal-insulator-transition","oscillation","neuron","resistive memory","synaptic array","neuromorphic computing"]}],"doi":"10.1145/2966986.2967015","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Computer-Aided Design (ICCAD)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Computer-Aided Design (ICCAD)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7787013/7827541/07827592.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1145/2966986.2967015","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7827541","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Compact oscillation neuron exploiting metal-insulator-transition for neuromorphic computing","abstract":"The phenomenon of metal-insulator-transition (MIT) in strongly correlated oxides, such as NbO\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sub>\n, have shown the oscillation behavior in recent experiments. In this work, the MIT based two-terminal device is proposed as a compact oscillation neuron for the parallel read operation from the resistive synaptic array. The weighted sum is represented by the frequency of the oscillation neuron. Compared to the complex CMOS integrate-and-fire neuron with tens of transistors, the oscillation neuron achieves significant area reduction, thereby alleviating the column pitch matching problem of the peripheral circuitry in resistive memories. Firstly, the impact of MIT device characteristics on the weighted sum accuracy is investigated when the oscillation neuron is connected to a single resistive synaptic device. Secondly, the array-level performance is explored when the oscillation neurons are connected to the resistive synaptic array. To address the interference of oscillation between columns in simple cross-point arrays, a 2-transistor-1-resistor (2T1R) array architecture is proposed at negligible increase in array area. Finally, the circuit-level benchmark of the proposed oscillation neuron with the CMOS neuron is performed. At single neuron node level, oscillation neuron shows >12.5\u00d7 reduction of area.

Existing camouflaging techniques have been broken by a recent decamouflaging attack, which uses Boolean satisfiability (SAT) techniques to compute specialized discriminating input patterns that prune the functionality search space quickly. This paper presents CamoPerturb, a countermeasure to thwart the decamouflaging attack by integrating logic perturbation with IC camouflaging. CamoPerturb, contrary to all the existing camouflaging schemes, perturbs the functionality of the given design minimally, i.e., adds/removes one minterm, rather than camouflaging the design. A separate camouflaged block CamoFix restores the perturbed minterm, recovering the functionality of the design. The perturbed minterm is the designer's secret and is incorporated into CamoFix using camouflaged cells. CamoPerturb renders the decamouflaging attack effort exponentially harder in the number of camouflaged gates while its overhead grows linearly.

Nevertheless, most contests focus only on the point tool problems instead of addressing the design flow or co-optimization among design tools. OpenDesign Flow Database platform is developed to direct attentions to the overall design flow from logic synthesis to physical design optimization [1].

Traditional triggers base on rare events, such as rare values or sequences. While in most cases these trigger circuits are able to hide a Trojan attack, exhaustive functional simulation and testing will reveal the Trojan due to violation of the specification. Our trigger behaves functionally and formally equivalent to the hardware description language (HDL) specification throughout the entire FPGA design flow, until the design is written by the place-and-route tool as bitstream configuration file. From then, Trojan payload is always on. We implement the trigger signal using a 4-input lookup table (LUT), each of the inputs connecting to the same signal. This lets us directly address the least significant bit (LSB) and most significant bit (MSB) of the LUT. With the remaining 14 bits, we realize a \u201cmagic\u201d unary operation. This way, we are able to implement 16 different Triggers. We demonstrate the attack with a simple example and discuss the effectiveness of the recent detection techniques unused circuit identification (UCI), functional analysis for nearly-unused circuit identification (FANCI) and VeriTrust in order to reveal our trigger.","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Computer-Aided Design (ICCAD)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Computer-Aided Design (ICCAD)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7787013/7827541/07827620.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Malicious LUT: A stealthy FPGA Trojan injected and triggered by the design flow","doi":"10.1145/2966986.2967054","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7827541","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1145/2966986.2967054","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7827620","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7827620/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-10 Nov. 2016","displayDocTitle":"Malicious LUT: A stealthy FPGA Trojan injected and triggered by the design flow","dateOfInsertion":"23 January 2017","publicationDate":"Nov. 2016","accessionNumber":"16618709","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"7-10 Nov. 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7827620/","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Malicious LUT: A stealthy FPGA Trojan injected and triggered by the design flow","confLoc":"Austin, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"4A_1.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.084354S","chronDate":"7-10 Nov. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7787013","isNumber":"7827541","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7787013","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"7827541","articleId":"7827620","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ACM","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7827639,"authors":[{"name":"Teng Xu","affiliation":["Computer Science Department, University of California, Los Angeles"],"lastName":"Teng Xu","id":"37087072612"},{"name":"Miodrag Potkonjak","affiliation":["Computer Science Department, University of California, Los Angeles"],"firstName":"Miodrag","lastName":"Potkonjak","id":"37279233100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4503-4466-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3421-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2434"}],"articleNumber":"7827639","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":402},"keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS memory circuits","energy conservation","fault tolerance","Internet of Things","minimax techniques","random-access storage"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["IoT architectures","mincut maxflow algorithm","CMOS transistors","synchronous data flow model","FT","NVM","nonvolatile memory","Internet of Things","energy-efficient fault tolerance"]}],"abstract":"Fault tolerance (FT) is essential in many Internet of Things (IoT) applications, in particular in the domains such as medical devices and automotive systems where a single fault in the system can lead to serious consequences. Non-volatile memory (NVM), on the other hand, is commonly used to improve system reliability due to its unique properties to retain data even if the power supply is lost. However, one of the most important drawbacks of NVM is that it imposes significant overhead regarding timing and energy. In this paper, we have proposed a unique technique with the use of NVM to create FT application specific architecture with almost no timing overhead and low energy overhead. We address the implementation of applications that are specified using synchronous data flow model of computation. We combine the use of NVM and classical CMOS transistors so that NVM judiciously stores selected complete states of the pertinent program. It allows the program to resume from the saved state in NVM when faults occur. The frequency of the state selection can be flexibly adjusted for an arbitrarily specified FT timing/energy overhead. Moreover, to find an optimal state selection (with low overhead), we have applied an improved min-cut max-flow algorithm. On a variety of typical benchmarks, the simulation results indicate that our approach incurs only a small overhead over lower bounds. It is also generic in a sense that it can be applied to a wide spectrum of underlying IoT architectures and computational models.","doi":"10.1145/2966986.2967034","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Computer-Aided Design (ICCAD)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Computer-Aided Design (ICCAD)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7787013/7827541/07827639.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7827541","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1145/2966986.2967034","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Energy-efficient fault tolerance approach for Internet of Things applications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7827639","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-10 Nov. 2016","displayDocTitle":"Energy-efficient fault tolerance approach for Internet of Things applications","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7827639/","publicationDate":"Nov. 2016","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"23 January 2017","accessionNumber":"16618655","htmlLink":"/document/7827639/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"7-10 Nov. 2016","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy-efficient fault tolerance approach for Internet of Things applications","confLoc":"Austin, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"5B_1.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059627S","chronDate":"7-10 Nov. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7787013","isNumber":"7827541","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7787013","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7827541","articleId":"7827639","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ACM","lastupdate":"2021-08-21"},{"_id":7827640,"authors":[{"name":"Yutaka Masuda","affiliation":["Department of Information Systems Engineering, Osaka University"],"firstName":"Yutaka","lastName":"Masuda","id":"37085638769"},{"name":"Masanori Hashimoto","affiliation":["Department of Information Systems Engineering, Osaka University"],"firstName":"Masanori","lastName":"Hashimoto","id":"37268990900"},{"name":"Takao Onoye","affiliation":["Department of Information Systems Engineering, Osaka University"],"firstName":"Takao","lastName":"Onoye","id":"37270881600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4503-4466-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3421-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2434"}],"articleNumber":"7827640","dbTime":"30 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":148},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Delays","Aging","Manufacturing","Design methodology","Logic gates","Error analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["integer programming","linear programming","logic design","sequential circuits","stochastic processes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["time-to-failure extension","critical path isolation","mean time to failure","supply voltage reduction","stochastic timing error rate estimation","integer linear programming"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["critical path isolation","mean time to failure","supply voltage reduction","stochastic timing error rate estimation","integer linear programming"]}],"abstract":"Device miniaturization due to technology scaling has made manufacturing variability and aging more significant, and lower supply voltage makes circuits sensitive to dynamic environmental fluctuation. These may shorten the time to failure (TTF) of fabricated chips unexpectedly. This paper focuses on critical path isolation, which increases timing slack of non-intrinsic critical paths and decreases timing error occurrence probability in the circuit, and proposes a design methodology of isolated circuits for TTF extension and/or lower voltage operation. The proposed methodology selects a set of FFs for isolation using ILP so that it maximumly reduces the sum of gate-wise failure probabilities. We evaluated MTTF (Mean Time To Failure) of circuits with/without critical path isolation and examined how much supply voltage could be reduced without MTTF degradation. Evaluation results show that circuits with the proposed critical path isolation achieved 25% supply voltage reduction with 1.4% area overhead. With the same supply voltage, MTTF was improved by 14 orders of magnitude.","doi":"10.1145/2966986.2967019","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Computer-Aided Design (ICCAD)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Computer-Aided Design (ICCAD)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7787013/7827541/07827640.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1145/2966986.2967019","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7827541","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Critical path isolation for time-to-failure extension and lower voltage operation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7827640","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Critical path isolation for time-to-failure extension and lower voltage operation","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-10 Nov. 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7827640/","conferenceDate":"7-10 Nov. 2016","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2016","accessionNumber":"16618649","dateOfInsertion":"23 January 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7827640/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Critical path isolation for time-to-failure extension and lower voltage operation","confLoc":"Austin, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"5B_2.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.097887S","chronDate":"7-10 Nov. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7787013","isNumber":"7827541","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7787013","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"7827541","articleId":"7827640","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ACM","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7827642,"authors":[{"name":"Parivallal Kannan","affiliation":["Xilinx Inc., San Jose, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Parivallal","lastName":"Kannan","id":"37338205700"},{"name":"Satish Sivaswamy","affiliation":["Xilinx Inc., San Jose, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Satish","lastName":"Sivaswamy","id":"37945659000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4503-4466-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3421-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2434"}],"articleNumber":"7827642","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":251},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance driven routing for modern FPGAs invited paper","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Computer-Aided Design (ICCAD)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7787013/7827541/07827642.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Computer-Aided Design (ICCAD)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1145/2966986.2980082","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7827541","doi":"10.1145/2966986.2980082","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Clocks","Routing","Field programmable gate arrays","Delays","Optimization","Fabrics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","field programmable gate arrays","network routing","optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["performance driven routing","FPGA routing","point-to-point net routing","FPGA fabrics","shortest path algorithms","Dijkstra algorithm","A-star algorithm","rip-up algorithm","reroute algorithm","PathFinder","polynomial time-complexity","best-case timing performance","datapath congestion alleviation","Xilinx Ultrascale+ family","clocking architecture","clock skews","low-cost time-borrow optimization"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["FPGA","Routing","Skew","Hold","Congestion","Time-borrow","Performance"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7827642","abstract":"FPGA routing is a well studied problem. Basic point-to-point routing of nets on FPGA fabrics can be done optimally using well known shortest path algorithms like Dijkstra's and A-star. Practical rip-up and reroute algorithms like PathFinder have been very influential in various academic and industrial routers. The relaxed version of the routing problem, that ignores congestion, has a polynomial time-complexity. This allows us to easily determine the best-case timing performance of a placed design and the degradation introduced by the router due to congestion alleviation on the datapath. Is it possible for an industrial router to actually improve upon the best case timing performance? Modern FPGAs like the Xilinx Ultrascale+ family, have introduced major changes to the clocking architecture to help improve clock skews and also to support a large number of user clocks. The new clocking architectures also allow the router to perform low-cost time-borrow optimization and efficient high fanout net routing, to alleviate fabric congestion and simplify timing-closure. We describe various methods by which industrial FPGA routers take advantage of the clocking features to improve timing performance of placed circuit designs beyond the traditional best-case scenarios.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7827642/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-10 Nov. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"Nov. 2016","accessionNumber":"16618656","htmlLink":"/document/7827642/","dateOfInsertion":"23 January 2017","conferenceDate":"7-10 Nov. 2016","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Performance driven routing for modern FPGAs invited paper","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance driven routing for modern FPGAs invited paper","confLoc":"Austin, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"5C_1.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052838S","chronDate":"7-10 Nov. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7787013","isNumber":"7827541","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7787013","xplore-issue":"7827541","articleId":"7827642","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ACM","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7827645,"authors":[{"name":"Ryan Pattison","affiliation":["School of Engineering, University of Guelph, Guelph, ON, Canada"],"firstName":"Ryan","lastName":"Pattison","id":"37085624830"},{"name":"Ziad Abuowaimer","affiliation":["School of Engineering, University of Guelph, Guelph, ON, Canada"],"firstName":"Ziad","lastName":"Abuowaimer","id":"37086000530"},{"name":"Shawki Areibi","affiliation":["School of Engineering, University of Guelph, Guelph, ON, Canada"],"firstName":"Shawki","lastName":"Areibi","id":"37276434400"},{"name":"Gary Gr\u00e9wal","affiliation":["School of Computer Science, University of Guelph, Guelph, ON, Canada"],"firstName":"Gary","lastName":"Gr\u00e9wal","id":"37276420700"},{"name":"Anthony Vannelli","affiliation":["School of Engineering, University of Guelph, Guelph, ON, Canada"],"firstName":"Anthony","lastName":"Vannelli","id":"37344643100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4503-4466-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3421-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2434"}],"articleNumber":"7827645","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":756},"abstract":"Traditional FPGA flows that wait until the routing stage to tackle congestion are quickly becoming less effective.

The former placer participated in the ISPD 2016 Routability-driven Placement Contest for FPGAs, and finished in third place overall. The latter placer was subseqently developed based on our experience in the contest with GPlace-pack. Results obtained indicate that GPlace-flat is on average 5.3\u00d7 faster than GPlace-pack.

Over the past decade, there have been tremendous advances in the domain of flexible electronics which enabled printing of devices, such as sensors on a flexible substrate. Despite these advances, pure flexible electronics systems are limited by poor performance and large feature sizes. Flexible hybrid electronics (FHE) is an emerging technology which addresses these issues by integrating high performance rigid integrated circuits and flexible devices. Yet, there are no system-level design flows and algorithms for the design of FHE systems. To this end, this paper presents a multi-objective design algorithm to implement a target application optimally using a library of rigid and flexible components. Our algorithm produces a set of Pareto frontiers that optimize the physical flexibility, energy per operation and area metrics. Simulation studies show a 32\u00d7 range in area and 4\u00d7 range in flexibility across the set of Pareto-optimal design points.","doi":"10.1145/2966986.2967057","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Computer-Aided Design (ICCAD)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1145/2966986.2967057","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7827541","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Computer-Aided Design (ICCAD)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7787013/7827541/07827650.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multi-objective design optimization for flexible hybrid electronics","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7827650/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Multi-objective design optimization for flexible hybrid electronics","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7827650/","accessionNumber":"16618677","publicationDate":"Nov. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"23 January 2017","conferenceDate":"7-10 Nov. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-10 Nov. 2016","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multi-objective design optimization for flexible hybrid electronics","confLoc":"Austin, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"6A_2.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.111372S","chronDate":"7-10 Nov. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7787013","isNumber":"7827541","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7787013","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"7827541","articleId":"7827650","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ACM","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":7827654,"authors":[{"name":"Giuseppe Natale","affiliation":["DEIB"],"firstName":"Giuseppe","lastName":"Natale","id":"37086049961"},{"name":"Giulio Stramondo","affiliation":["University of Amsterdam","DEIB"],"firstName":"Giulio","lastName":"Stramondo","id":"37086163071"},{"name":"Pietro Bressana","affiliation":["DEIB"],"firstName":"Pietro","lastName":"Bressana","id":"37086159030"},{"name":"Riccardo Cattaneo","affiliation":["DEIB"],"firstName":"Riccardo","lastName":"Cattaneo","id":"38468879600"},{"name":"Donatella Sciuto","affiliation":["DEIB"],"firstName":"Donatella","lastName":"Sciuto","id":"37273958200"},{"name":"Marco D.

Conventional deep neural networks (DNNs) are fully-connected multi-layer networks with hundreds or thousands of neurons in each layer. Such a network requires a very large weight memory to store the connectivity between neurons. In this paper, we propose a hardware-centric methodology to design low power neural networks with significantly smaller memory footprint and computation resource requirements. We achieve this by judiciously dropping connections in large blocks of weights. The corresponding technique, termed coarse-grain sparsification (CGS), introduces hardware-aware sparsity during the DNN training, which leads to efficient weight memory compression and significant computation reduction during classification without losing accuracy. We apply the proposed approach to DNN design for keyword detection and speech recognition. When the two DNNs are trained with 75% of the weights dropped and classified with 5-6 bit weight precision, the weight memory requirement is reduced by 95% compared to their fully-connected counterparts with double precision, while maintaining similar performance in keyword detection accuracy, word error rate, and sentence error rate. To validate this technique in real hardware, a time-multiplexed architecture using a shared multiply and accumulate (MAC) engine was implemented in 65nm and 40nm low power (LP) CMOS. In 40nm at 0.6 V, the keyword detection network consumes 36\u03bcW and the speech recognition network consumes 552\u03bcW, making this technique highly suitable for mobile and wearable devices.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7827655/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-10 Nov. 2016","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"7-10 Nov. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"23 January 2017","publicationDate":"Nov. 2016","accessionNumber":"16618728","htmlLink":"/document/7827655/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Efficient memory compression in deep neural networks using coarse-grain sparsification for speech applications","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient memory compression in deep neural networks using coarse-grain sparsification for speech applications","confLoc":"Austin, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"6B_3.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.09232S","chronDate":"7-10 Nov. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7787013","isNumber":"7827541","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7787013","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"7827541","articleId":"7827655","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ACM","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7827657,"authors":[{"name":"Semeen Rehman","affiliation":["Chair for Processor Design, Technische Universit\u00e4t Dresden (TUD), Dresden, Germany"],"firstName":"Semeen","lastName":"Rehman","id":"38026967200"},{"name":"Walaa El-Harouni","affiliation":["Karlsruher Institut fur Technologie, Karlsruhe, Baden-W\u00c3\u00bcrttemberg, DE"],"firstName":"Walaa","lastName":"El-Harouni"},{"name":"Muhammad Shafique","affiliation":["Vienna University of Technology (TU Wien), Austria","Chair for Embedded Systems, Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT), Germany"],"firstName":"Muhammad","lastName":"Shafique","id":"37408660000"},{"name":"Akash Kumar","affiliation":["Chair for Processor Design, Technische Universit\u00e4t Dresden (TUD), Dresden, Germany"],"firstName":"Akash","lastName":"Kumar","id":"37292250700"},{"name":"Jorg Henkel","affiliation":["Chair for Embedded Systems, Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT), Germany"],"firstName":"Jorg","lastName":"Henkel","id":"37277243700"},{"name":"J\u00f6rg Henkel","affiliation":["Embedded Systems, Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT), Germany"],"firstName":"J\u00f6rg","lastName":"Henkel"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4503-4466-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3421-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2434"}],"articleNumber":"7827657","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":43,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1014},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7827657","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Adders","Libraries","Buildings","Approximate computing","Computational modeling","Data models","Open source software"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adders","electronic engineering computing","multiplying circuits","nanoelectronics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["architectural-space exploration","approximate multipliers design","elementary approximate multiply module types","elementary adder modules types","wide-bit multiplier design","synopsys design compiler","TSMC 45nm technology library","ModelSim gate-level simulations","power evaluations","quality evaluations","PrimeTime models","behavioral models","JPEG application"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Approximate Computing","Multiplier","Adder","Arithmetic","Design Space Exploration","Performance","Area","Power","Configurable Accuracy","Low Power Image Processing","Open Source","Library"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents an architectural-space exploration methodology for designing approximate multipliers.

Even well-optimized hardware implementations of digital NNs show significant power consumption. It is mainly due to non-uniform pipeline structures and inherent redundancy of numerous arithmetic operations that have to be performed to produce each single output vector. This paper provides a methodology for the design of well-optimized power-efficient NNs with a uniform structure suitable for hardware implementation. An error resilience analysis was performed in order to determine key constraints for the design of approximate multipliers that are employed in the resulting structure of NN. By means of a search based approximation method, approximate multipliers showing desired tradeoffs between the accuracy and implementation cost were created. Resulting approximate NNs, containing the approximate multipliers, were evaluated using standard benchmarks (MNIST dataset) and a real-world classification problem of Street-View House Numbers. Significant improvement in power efficiency was obtained in both cases with respect to regular NNs. In some cases, 91% power reduction of multiplication led to classification accuracy degradation of less than 2.80%. Moreover, the paper showed the capability of the back propagation learning algorithm to adapt with NNs containing the approximate multipliers.","doi":"10.1145/2966986.2967021","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Computer-Aided Design (ICCAD)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Computer-Aided Design (ICCAD)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7787013/7827541/07827658.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1145/2966986.2967021","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7827541","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design of power-efficient approximate multipliers for approximate artificial neural networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Design of power-efficient approximate multipliers for approximate artificial neural networks","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"23 January 2017","accessionNumber":"16618732","publicationDate":"Nov. 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7827658/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7827658/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-10 Nov. 2016","conferenceDate":"7-10 Nov. 2016","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design of power-efficient approximate multipliers for approximate artificial neural networks","confLoc":"Austin, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"6C_2.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056018S","chronDate":"7-10 Nov. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7787013","isNumber":"7827541","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7787013","citationCount":"42","xplore-issue":"7827541","articleId":"7827658","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ACM","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7827660,"authors":[{"name":"Arun Chandrasekharan","affiliation":["Group of Computer Architecture, University of Bremen, Germany"],"firstName":"Arun","lastName":"Chandrasekharan","id":"37085618934"},{"name":"Mathias Soeken","affiliation":["EPFL, Inteorated Systems Laboratory, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Mathias","lastName":"Soeken","id":"37391629800"},{"name":"Daniel Gro\u00dfe","affiliation":["Universitat Bremen, Bremen, Bremen, DE"],"firstName":"Daniel","lastName":"Gro\u00dfe"},{"name":"Rolf Drechsler","affiliation":["Cyber Physical Systems, DFKI GmbH, Bremen, Germany","Group of Computer Architecture, University of Bremen, Germany"],"firstName":"Rolf","lastName":"Drechsler","id":"37276502700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4503-4466-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3421-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2434"}],"articleNumber":"7827660","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":20,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":190},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7827660","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Approximation algorithms","Delays","Adders","Logic gates","Approximation error","Boolean functions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["approximation theory","rewriting systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["approximation-aware rewriting","AIG","error tolerant applications","automatic synthesis approach","and-inverter graphs","approximation errors","hand crafted adhoc approximation circuits","approximation adders","image compression"]}],"abstract":"Approximation circuits offer superior performance (speed and area) compared to traditional circuits at the cost of computational accuracy. The accuracy of the results in approximation circuits is evaluated based on several error metrics such as worst-case error, bit-flip error, or error-rate. Several applications have varied requirements in error metrics, i.e., all the error criteria have to be met together at a time, or in combinations. Nevertheless, all applications benefit from improved delay and area. An automated synthesis approach with formal guarantees on error metrics is very helpful in generating circuits that meet these criteria. Furthermore, each of these metrics are independent quantities (value of one metric does not correlate with the other), and automated synthesis can discover opportunities to trade off one or more of the relaxed metrics with a strict requirement on the other, resulting in better performance. In this paper, we present an automatic synthesis approach using And-Inverter Graphs (AIGs) based rewriting that not only improves the performance but also guarantees the bounds of approximation errors introduced. Our synthesis approach is evaluated on a wide range of designs and standard benchmark circuits to show the usefulness and applicability. In particular, we show that our synthesis results are even comparable with the optimization achieved with hand crafted adhoc approximation circuits such as approximation adders in a case study on image compression.","doi":"10.1145/2966986.2967003","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Computer-Aided Design (ICCAD)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Computer-Aided Design (ICCAD)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7787013/7827541/07827660.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1145/2966986.2967003","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7827541","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Approximation-aware rewriting of AIGs for error tolerant applications","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"7-10 Nov. 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7827660/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-10 Nov. 2016","displayDocTitle":"Approximation-aware rewriting of AIGs for error tolerant applications","dateOfInsertion":"23 January 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7827660/","accessionNumber":"16618749","publicationDate":"Nov. 2016","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Approximation-aware rewriting of AIGs for error tolerant applications","confLoc":"Austin, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"6C_4.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.092695S","chronDate":"7-10 Nov. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7787013","isNumber":"7827541","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7787013","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"7827541","articleId":"7827660","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ACM","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7827670,"authors":[{"name":"Matthew R.

The representation allows complex arithmetic to be performed with very simple logic, but it suffers from high latency and poor precision. Furthermore, the results are always somewhat inaccurate due to random fluctuations. The random or pseudorandom sources required to generate the representation are costly, consuming a majority of the circuit area (and diminishing the overall gains in area). In this paper, we show that randomness is not a requirement for this computational paradigm. If properly structured, the same arithmetical constructs can operate on deterministic bit streams, with the data represented uniformly by the fraction of 1's versus 0's. This paper presents three approaches for the computation: relatively prime stream lengths, rotation, and clock division. The three methods are evaluated on a collection of arithmetical functions. Unlike stochastic methods, all three of our deterministic methods produce completely accurate results. The cost of generating the deterministic streams is a small fraction of the cost of generating streams from random/pseudorandom sources. Most importantly, the latency is reduced by a factor of 1/2\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">n</sup>\n, where n is the equivalent number of bits of precision.","doi":"10.1145/2966986.2966988","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Computer-Aided Design (ICCAD)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Computer-Aided Design (ICCAD)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7787013/7827541/07827679.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1145/2966986.2966988","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7827541","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7827679","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A deterministic approach to stochastic computation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-10 Nov. 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7827679/","displayDocTitle":"A deterministic approach to stochastic computation","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7827679/","publicationDate":"Nov. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"23 January 2017","conferenceDate":"7-10 Nov. 2016","accessionNumber":"16618708","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A deterministic approach to stochastic computation","confLoc":"Austin, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"8C_1.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070834S","chronDate":"7-10 Nov. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7787013","isNumber":"7827541","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7787013","citationCount":"36","xplore-issue":"7827541","articleId":"7827679","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ACM","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7827680,"authors":[{"name":"Qin Wang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science & Technology, Tsinghua University"],"firstName":"Qin","lastName":"Wang","id":"37085658873"},{"name":"Zeyan Li","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science & Technology, Tsinghua University"],"lastName":"Zeyan Li","id":"37088723188"},{"name":"Haena Cheong","affiliation":["Sogang University, Mapo-gu, Seoul, KR"],"lastName":"Haena Cheong","id":"37088735494"},{"name":"Oh-Sun Kwon","affiliation":["Department of Chemistry & Institute of Biological Interfaces, Sogang University"],"lastName":"Oh-Sun Kwon","id":"37088739175"},{"name":"Hailong Yao","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science & Technology, Tsinghua University"],"lastName":"Hailong Yao","id":"37087264665"},{"name":"Tsung-Yi Ho","affiliation":["National Tsing Hua University","Institute for Advanced Study, Technical University of Munich (TUM)"],"lastName":"Tsung-Yi Ho","id":"37087699350"},{"name":"Kwanwoo Shin","affiliation":["Department of Chemistry & Institute of Biological Interfaces, Sogang University"],"firstName":"Kwanwoo","lastName":"Shin","id":"37087893367"},{"name":"Bing Li","affiliation":["Technische Universitat Munchen, Munchen, Bayern, DE"],"lastName":"Bing Li","id":"37087580450"},{"name":"Ulf Schlichtmann","affiliation":["Institute for Electronic Design Automation, Technical University of Munich (TUM)"],"firstName":"Ulf","lastName":"Schlichtmann","id":"37265854500"},{"name":"Yici Cai","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science & Technology, Tsinghua University"],"lastName":"Yici Cai","id":"37087065584"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4503-4466-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3421-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2434"}],"articleNumber":"7827680","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":13,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":327},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7827680","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Electrodes","Routing","Voltage control","Interference","Printers","Ink","Processor scheduling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biochemistry","biological techniques","bioMEMS","carbon nanotubes","drops","lab-on-a-chip","microelectrodes","microfluidics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["control-fluidic codesign","paper-based digital microfluidic biochip","biochemical assay","electrode","photo paper","inkjet printer","conductive ink","carbon nanotube control line","droplet movement","control line routing","fluidic droplet scheduling","droplet rescheduling"]}],"abstract":"Paper-based digital microfluidic biochips (P-DMFBs) have recently emerged as a promising low-cost and fast-responsive platform for biochemical assays. In P-DMFBs, electrodes and control lines are printed on a piece of photo paper using inkjet printer and conductive ink of carbon nanotubes (CNTs). Compared with traditional digital microfluidic biochips (DMFBs), P-DMFBs enjoy notable advantages, such as faster in-place fabrication with printer and ink, lower costs, better disposability, etc. Because electrodes and CNT control lines are printed on the same side of a paper, a new design challenge for P-DMFB is to prevent the interference between moving droplets and the voltages on CNT control lines. These interactions may result in unexpected droplet movements and thus incorrect assay outputs. To address the new challenges in automated design of P-DMFBs, this paper proposes the first control-fluidic codesign flow, which simultaneously adjusts the control line routing and fluidic droplet scheduling to achieve an optimized solution. As the control line routing may not be able to address all the interferences between moving droplets and the voltages on control lines, droplet rescheduling is performed to effectively deal with the remaining interferences in the routing solution. Computational simulation results on real-life bioassays show that the proposed codesign method successfully eliminates all the interferences, while a state-of-the-art maze routing method cannot solve any of the benchmarks without conflicts.","doi":"10.1145/2966986.2967018","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Computer-Aided Design (ICCAD)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Computer-Aided Design (ICCAD)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7787013/7827541/07827680.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1145/2966986.2967018","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7827541","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Control-fluidic codesign for paper-based digital microfluidic biochips","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7827680/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-10 Nov. 2016","displayDocTitle":"Control-fluidic codesign for paper-based digital microfluidic biochips","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2016","accessionNumber":"16618696","htmlLink":"/document/7827680/","dateOfInsertion":"23 January 2017","conferenceDate":"7-10 Nov. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Control-fluidic codesign for paper-based digital microfluidic biochips","confLoc":"Austin, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"8C_2.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.104033S","chronDate":"7-10 Nov. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7787013","isNumber":"7827541","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7787013","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"7827541","articleId":"7827680","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ACM","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7827681,"authors":[{"name":"Sean C.

Both the performance and computational complexity of such models are heavily dependant on the design of characteristic hyper-parameters (e.g., number of hidden layers, nodes per layer, or choice of activation functions), which have traditionally been optimized manually. With machine learning penetrating low-power mobile and embedded areas, the need to optimize not only for performance (accuracy), but also for implementation complexity, becomes paramount. In this work, we present a multi-objective design space exploration method that reduces the number of solution networks trained and evaluated through response surface modelling. Given spaces which can easily exceed 10\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">20</sup>\n solutions, manually designing a near-optimal architecture is unlikely as opportunities to reduce network complexity, while maintaining performance, may be overlooked. This problem is exacerbated by the fact that hyper-parameters which perform well on specific datasets may yield sub-par results on others, and must therefore be designed on a per-application basis. In our work, machine learning is leveraged by training an artificial neural network to predict the performance of future candidate networks. The method is evaluated on the MNIST and CIFAR-10 image datasets, optimizing for both recognition accuracy and computational complexity. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can closely approximate the Pareto-optimal front, while only exploring a small fraction of the design

recovery in a micro-electrode-dot-array digital microfluidic biochip","abstract":"A digital microfluidic biochip (DMFB) is an attractive technology platform for automating laboratory procedures in biochemistry. However, today's DMFBs suffer from several limitations: (i) constraints on droplet size and the inability to vary droplet volume in a fine-grained manner; (ii) the lack of integrated sensors for real-time detection; (iii) the need for special fabrication processes and the associated reliability/yield concerns. To overcome the above problems, DMFBs based on a micro-electrode-dot-array (MEDA) architecture have been proposed recently, and droplet manipulation on these devices has been experimentally demonstrated. Errors are likely to occur due to defects, chip degradation, and the lack of precision inherent in biochemical experiments. Therefore, an efficient error-recovery strategy is essential to ensure the correctness of assays executed on MEDA biochips. By exploiting MEDA-specific advances in droplet sensing, we present a novel error-recovery technique to dynamically reconfigure the biochip using real-time data provided by on-chip sensors. Local recovery strategies based on probabilistic-timed-automata are presented for various types of errors. A control flow is also proposed to connect local recovery procedures with global error recovery for the complete bioassay. Laboratory experiments using a fabricated MEDA chip are used to characterize the outcomes of key droplet operations. The PRISM model checker and three analytical chemistry benchmarks are used for an extensive set of simulations. Our results highlight the effectiveness of the proposed error-recovery strategy.\u03c3","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7827682/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-10 Nov. 2016","publicationDate":"Nov. 2016","conferenceDate":"7-10 Nov. 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7827682/","dateOfInsertion":"23 January 2017","accessionNumber":"16618776","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Error recovery in a micro-electrode-dot-array digital microfluidic biochip","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Error recovery in a micro-electrode-dot-array digital microfluidic biochip","confLoc":"Austin, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"8C_4.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.105304S","chronDate":"7-10 Nov. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7787013","isNumber":"7827541","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7787013","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"7827541","articleId":"7827682","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ACM","lastupdate":"2021-09-22"},{"_id":7827687,"authors":[{"name":"Sandeep Chatterjee","affiliation":["University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, CA"],"firstName":"Sandeep","lastName":"Chatterjee","id":"37085500758"},{"name":"Valeriy Sukharev","affiliation":["ECE Department, University of of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada"],"firstName":"Valeriy","lastName":"Sukharev","id":"37320942200"},{"name":"Farid N.

In this paper, we present a novel approach for EM checking using physics-based models of EM degradation, which effectively removes the inaccuracy, with negligible impact on run-time. Our main contribution is to extend the existing physical models for EMin metal branches to track the degradation in multi-branch interconnect trees. We also propose effective filtering and predictor-based schemes to speed up our implementation, with minimal impact on accuracy. Our results, for a number of IBM power grid benchmarks, confirm that Black's model is overly inaccurate. The lifetimes found using our physics-based approach are on average 3\u00d7 longer than those based on a (calibrated) Black's model, such as currently used in industry. For the two largest IBM benchmarks (700K branches each), our runtime is comparable to that of the Black's based approach, requiring 3 hours for the largest grid.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7827687/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-10 Nov. 2016","conferenceDate":"7-10 Nov. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"23 January 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7827687/","accessionNumber":"16618719","displayDocTitle":"Fast physics-based electromigration checking for on-die power grids","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fast physics-based electromigration checking for on-die power grids","confLoc":"Austin, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"9A_1.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.093868S","chronDate":"7-10 Nov. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7787013","isNumber":"7827541","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7787013","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"7827541","articleId":"7827687","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ACM","lastupdate":"2021-12-20"},{"_id":7827690,"authors":[{"name":"Zeyu Sun","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of California, Riverside, CA"],"lastName":"Zeyu Sun","id":"37085835987"},{"name":"Ertugrul Demircan","affiliation":["Physical Verification Group, NXP Semiconductors, Austin, TX 78735, United States of America"],"firstName":"Ertugrul","lastName":"Demircan"},{"name":"Mehul D.

Existing EM signoff mainly relies on current density-based assessment using Black's equation and Blech product. This model does not work well for multi-branch interconnect wires as the stresses developed in each wire segment is not independent of one another. In this paper, we present a novel and fast EM Immortality check for general multi-branch interconnect trees. Instead of using current density as the key parameter as in traditional methods, the new method estimates the EM-induced stress in general multi-branch interconnects based on the terminal voltages or potentials. It can be viewed as the Blech product for multi-branch interconnects for fast check of EM immortality of wires. Besides, this voltage-based EM (VBEM) assessment technique can naturally comprehend the impact of the topology of the wire structure on EM-induced stress. As a result, this new VBEM analysis method is very amenable to EM violation fixing as it brings new capabilities to the physical design stage. The VBEM stress estimation method is based on the fundamental steady-state stress equations. This approach eliminates the need for complex look-up tables for different geometries and can be implemented in CAD tools very easily as we demonstrate on real design examples. We show that its solution is consistent with the physics-based dynamic EM stress evaluations from the numerical analysis by COMSOL.","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Computer-Aided Design (ICCAD)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7787013/7827541/07827690.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Computer-Aided Design (ICCAD)","doi":"10.1145/2966986.2967083","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1145/2966986.2967083","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7827541","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7827690","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Voltage-based electromigration immortality check for general multi-branch interconnects","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Stress","Wires","Mathematical model","Steady-state","Metals","Current density","Cathodes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electromigration","integrated circuit design","integrated circuit interconnections","integrated circuit reliability","integrated circuit testing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["voltage based electromigration immortality check","general multibranch interconnects","VLSI","reliability issue","current density based assessment","Black equation","Blech product","physical design stage","VBEM stress estimation method"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7827690/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-10 Nov. 2016","displayDocTitle":"Voltage-based electromigration immortality check for general multi-branch interconnects","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7827690/","publicationDate":"Nov. 2016","accessionNumber":"16618735","dateOfInsertion":"23 January 2017","conferenceDate":"7-10 Nov. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Voltage-based electromigration immortality check for general multi-branch interconnects","confLoc":"Austin, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"9A_4.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.084911S","chronDate":"7-10 Nov. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7787013","isNumber":"7827541","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7787013","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"7827541","articleId":"7827690","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ACM","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7827691,"authors":[{"name":"Ye Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Texas at Austin, Austin, TX, USA"],"lastName":"Ye Wang","id":"37085519903"},{"name":"Constantine Caramanis","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Texas at Austin, Austin, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Constantine","lastName":"Caramanis","id":"37294840300"},{"name":"Michael Orshansky","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Texas at Austin, Austin, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Orshansky","id":"37274704100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4503-4466-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3421-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2434"}],"articleNumber":"7827691","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":269},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Transforms","Hardware","Smoothing methods","Principal component analysis","Algorithm design and analysis","Sparse matrices","Signal processing algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Big Data","energy conservation","field programmable gate arrays","learning (artificial intelligence)","matrix algebra","pattern classification","power aware computing","principal component analysis","random processes","transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Big-Data applications","hardware acceleration","energy-efficient hardware implementation","sketching","random projections","Johnson Lindenstrauss transform","projection matrix","highly efficient fixed-point arithmetic","machine-learning applications","smoothing property","JL transform","randomizing property","operand bit-width reduction","random matrix construction","sparsity structure","FPGA","k-nearest neighbor classification","principal component analysis","KNN","I/O streaming","hardware-efficient JL algorithm","PCA"]}],"abstract":"Energy-efficient processing of large matrices for big-data applications using hardware acceleration is an intense area of research. Sketching of large matrices into their lower-dimensional representations is an effective strategy. For the first time, this paper develops a highly energy-efficient hardware implementation of a class of sketching methods based on random projections, known as Johnson Lindenstrauss (JL) transform. Crucially, we show how the randomness inherent in the projection matrix can be exploited to create highly efficient fixed-point arithmetic realizations of several machine-learning applications. Specifically, the transform's random matrices have two key properties that allow for significant energy gains in hardware implementations. The first is the smoothing property that allows us to drastically reduce operand bit-width in computation of the JL transform itself. The second is the randomizing property that allows bit-width reduction in subsequent machine-learning applications. Further, we identify a random matrix construction method that exploits the special sparsity structure to result in the most hardware-efficient realization and implement the highly optimized transform on an FPGA. Experimental results on (1) the k-nearest neighbor (KNN) classification and (2) the principal component analysis (PCA) show that with the same bit-width the proposed flow utilizing random projection achieves an up to 7\u00d7 improvement in both latency and energy. Furthermore, by exploiting the smoothing and randomizing properties we are able to use a 1-bit instead of a 4-bit multiplier within KNN, which results in additional 50% and 6% improvement in area and energy respectively. The proposed I/O streaming strategy along with the hardware-efficient JL algorithm identified by us is able to achieve a 50% runtime reduction, a 17% area reduction in the stage of random projection compared to a standard design.","doi":"10.1145/2966986.2967038","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Computer-Aided Design (ICCAD)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Computer-Aided Design (ICCAD)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7787013/7827541/07827691.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1145/2966986.2967038","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7827541","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Exploiting randomness in sketching for efficient hardware implementation of machine learning applications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7827691","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Exploiting randomness in sketching for efficient hardware implementation of machine learning applications","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-10 Nov. 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7827691/","conferenceDate":"7-10 Nov. 2016","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2016","accessionNumber":"16618660","dateOfInsertion":"23 January 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7827691/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Exploiting randomness in sketching for efficient hardware implementation of machine learning applications","confLoc":"Austin, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"9B_1.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.10032S","chronDate":"7-10 Nov. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7787013","isNumber":"7827541","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7787013","xplore-issue":"7827541","articleId":"7827691","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ACM","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7827695,"authors":[{"name":"Linuo Xue","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of California, Santa Barbara, CA, USA"],"lastName":"Linuo Xue","id":"37086036710"},{"name":"Yuanqing Cheng","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of California, Santa Barbara, CA, USA"],"lastName":"Yuanqing Cheng","id":"37086032951"},{"name":"Jianlei Yang","affiliation":["BeiHang University, Beijing, P.R.China"],"lastName":"Jianlei Yang","id":"37085653591"},{"name":"Peiyuan Wang","affiliation":["Qualcomm Research, San Diego, CA, USA"],"lastName":"Peiyuan Wang","id":"38025779900"},{"name":"Yuan Xie","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of California, Santa Barbara, CA, USA"],"lastName":"Yuan Xie","id":"37085345895"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4503-4466-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3421-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2434"}],"articleNumber":"7827695","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":192},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7827695","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sensors","Microprocessors","Computer architecture","Magnetic tunneling","Resistance","Reliability","Scalability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cache storage","circuit reliability","MRAM devices","network synthesis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["1T-IMTJ cell structures","2T-2MTJ cell structures","storage density","2T-2MTJ cell designs","1T-1MTJ cell designs","switching current","cache memory","spin-transfer torque magnetic RAM","STT-RAM","3T-3MTJ cell design","ODESY","size 40 nm"]}],"doi":"10.1145/2966986.2967060","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Computer-Aided Design (ICCAD)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Computer-Aided Design (ICCAD)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7787013/7827541/07827695.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1145/2966986.2967060","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7827541","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"ODESY: A novel 3T-3MTJ cell design with optimized area density, scalability and latency","abstract":"The STT-RAM (Spin-Transfer Torque Magnetic RAM) technology is a promising candidate for cache memory because of its high density, low standy-power, and non-volatility. As technology scales, especially under 40nm technology node, the read disturbance becomes severe since the read current approaches closely to the switching current. In addition, the read latency and access performance degrade significantly as well. The conventional 1T-1MTJ and 2T-2MTJ cell designs cannot address these challenges efficiently. In this paper, we propose a novel 3T-3MTJ cell structure using the advanced perpendicular MTJ technology. This memory cell has higher storage density and better performance, and is particularly suitable for the deeply scaled technology node. A two-stage sensing scheme is also proposed to facilitate the read operation of the 3T-3MTJ cell design. Circuit-level and architecture-level simulations show that the proposed 3T-3MTJ cell structure can achieve a better tradeoff between storage density, access performance, energy consumption, and reliability compared to the prior 1T-1MTJ and 2T-2MTJ cell structures.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7827695/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-10 Nov. 2016","publicationDate":"Nov. 2016","conferenceDate":"7-10 Nov. 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7827695/","dateOfInsertion":"23 January 2017","accessionNumber":"16618745","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"ODESY: A novel 3T-3MTJ cell design with optimized area density, scalability and latency","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"ODESY: A novel 3T-3MTJ cell design with optimized area density, scalability and latency","confLoc":"Austin, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"9C_1.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063901S","chronDate":"7-10 Nov. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7787013","isNumber":"7827541","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7787013","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"7827541","articleId":"7827695","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ACM","lastupdate":"2021-10-09"},{"_id":7827696,"authors":[{"name":"Debjyoti Bhattacharjee","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"firstName":"Debjyoti","lastName":"Bhattacharjee","id":"37085368882"},{"name":"Anupam Chattopadhyay","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"firstName":"Anupam","lastName":"Chattopadhyay","id":"37085342202"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4503-4466-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3421-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2434"}],"articleNumber":"7827696","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":11,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":340},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Delay-optimal technology mapping for In-Memory Computing using ReRAM devices","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7827696","keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["logic design","resistive RAM"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["delay-optimal technology mapping","in-memory computing","ReRAM devices","energy-efficiency","in-memory arithmetic circuits","neural networks","CAM","cache hierarchy","programmable processors","design automation tools","logic operation","logic synthesis flows","delay-optimal solution","heuristics","device count reduction","delay optimization","parallel instruction dispatch"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Resistive RAM","In-memory computing","Dispatch parallelism"]}],"doi":"10.1145/2966986.2967020","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Computer-Aided Design (ICCAD)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Computer-Aided Design (ICCAD)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7787013/7827541/07827696.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1145/2966986.2967020","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7827541","abstract":"Recent propositions of diverse In-Memory Computing platforms have shown a promising alternative to classical Von Neumann computing models. Significant benefits, in terms of energy-efficiency and performance, are reported for in-memory arithmetic circuits, neural networks, CAM, cache hierarchy and even fully programmable processors. In contrast, design automation tools supporting the development of such designs are still in a nascent phase. By leveraging the native stateful logic operation capability of ReRAM devices, several logic synthesis flows have been reported. In this paper, we complement these flows with a detailed study on the technology mapping phase for ReRAM devices. We provide a delay-optimal solution for technology mapping without area constraint and propose further heuristics to achieve device count reduction and to support delay optimization under the constraint of parallel instruction dispatch. We report at least 3\u00d7 less delay compared to the na\u00efve technology mapping adopted in recent studies. The proposed heuristics achieve 56% on average reduction in device count. Finally, a range of performance trade-offs is identified by applying the constraint of parallel instruction dispatch without noticeable degradation of delay.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7827696/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-10 Nov. 2016","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7827696/","publicationDate":"Nov. 2016","accessionNumber":"16618738","dateOfInsertion":"23 January 2017","conferenceDate":"7-10 Nov. 2016","displayDocTitle":"Delay-optimal technology mapping for In-Memory Computing using ReRAM devices","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Delay-optimal technology mapping for In-Memory Computing using ReRAM devices","confLoc":"Austin, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"9C_2.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.074463S","chronDate":"7-10 Nov. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7787013","isNumber":"7827541","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7787013","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"7827541","articleId":"7827696","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ACM","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7827697,"authors":[{"name":"Yue Zha","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI"],"lastName":"Yue Zha","id":"37085991612"},{"name":"Jing Li","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI"],"lastName":"Jing Li","id":"37085469824"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4503-4466-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3421-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2434"}],"articleNumber":"7827697","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":11,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":912},"abstract":"Driven by recent advances in resistive random-access memory (RRAM), there have been growing interests in exploring alternative computing concept, i.e., in-memory processing, to address the classical von Neumann bottlenecks. Despite of their great promise in improving performance and energy efficiency, most existing works are built on the inherent matrix-vector multiplication capability of RRAM crossbar structure, and thus lack the flexibility to adapt to future market/technology induced changes in data-intensive applications. To address these challenges, we propose an in-memory reconfigurable architecture based on RRAM crossbar structure. For the first time, it achieves a full programmability across computation and storage, and thereby provides more flexibilities of partitioning the hardware resources based on applications' needs. We further develop two complete CAD design flows to facilitate development of applications written in hardware description languages (HDLs) for our architecture, based on: 1) adaption from existing tool set developed for FPGA, 2) a custom tool design optimized towards the new architecture. Our experiments show that, both design flows are effective in exploiting flexible resources offered by our architecture and thus achieves better efficiency than state-of-art FPGAs (30% improvement in performance with 66% reduction in area). In addition, compared to adapted design flow, our custom design flow achieves speedup by 3.3\u00d7, and further improves mapping quality.","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7827697","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Field programmable gate arrays","Random access memory","Routing","Hardware","Arrays","Bars"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","reconfigurable architectures","resistive RAM"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["reconfigurable in-memory computing","resistive memory crossbar","resistive random-access memory","alternative computing concept","in-memory processing","von Neumann bottlenecks","energy efficiency","matrix-vector multiplication capability","RRAM crossbar structure","data-intensive applications","in-memory reconfigurable architecture","programmability","hardware resources","CAD design flows","hardware description languages","HDL","FPGA","custom tool design","adapted design flow"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["RRAM","Reconfigurable","In-memory Computing"]}],"publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Computer-Aided Design (ICCAD)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Computer-Aided Design (ICCAD)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7787013/7827541/07827697.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7827541","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1145/2966986.2967069","doi":"10.1145/2966986.2967069","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reconfigurable in-memory computing with resistive memory crossbar","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-10 Nov. 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7827697/","displayDocTitle":"Reconfigurable in-memory computing with resistive memory crossbar","isDynamicHtml":true,"isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"7-10 Nov. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"23 January 2017","publicationDate":"Nov. 2016","accessionNumber":"16618780","htmlLink":"/document/7827697/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reconfigurable in-memory computing with resistive memory crossbar","confLoc":"Austin, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"9C_3.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.18769S","chronDate":"7-10 Nov. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7787013","isNumber":"7827541","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7787013","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"7827541","articleId":"7827697","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ACM","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7827698,"authors":[{"name":"Xunzhao Yin","affiliation":["Department of CSE University of Notre Dame, Notre Dame, IN, USA"],"lastName":"Xunzhao Yin","id":"37085776453"},{"name":"Ahmedullah Aziz","affiliation":["Department of ECE, Pennsylvania State University, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Ahmedullah","lastName":"Aziz","id":"37085589751"},{"name":"Joseph Nahas","affiliation":["Department of CSE University of Notre Dame, Notre Dame, IN, USA"],"firstName":"Joseph","lastName":"Nahas","id":"38562884200"},{"name":"Suman Datta","affiliation":["Department of EE, University of Notre Dame, Notre Dame, IN, USA"],"firstName":"Suman","lastName":"Datta","id":"37085420463"},{"name":"Sumeet Gupta","affiliation":["Department of ECE, Pennsylvania State University, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Sumeet","lastName":"Gupta","id":"37279067800"},{"name":"Michael Niemier","affiliation":["Department of CSE University of Notre Dame, Notre Dame, IN, USA"],"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Niemier","id":"37274671800"},{"name":"Xiaobo Sharon Hu","affiliation":["Department of CSE University of Notre Dame, Notre Dame, IN, USA"],"lastName":"Xiaobo Sharon Hu","id":"37280709800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4503-4466-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3421-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2434"}],"articleNumber":"7827698","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":30,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1171},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7827698","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Iron","Magnetic tunneling","Hysteresis","MOSFET","Capacitance","Mathematical model"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ferroelectric devices","field effect transistors","logic circuits","logic design","low-power electronics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ferroelectric FET","low-power non-volatile logic-in-memory circuits","complementary circuit design","dynamic current mode circuit design","dynamic logic circuit design"]}],"abstract":"Numerous research efforts are targeting new devices that could continue performance scaling trends associated with Moore's Law and/or accomplish computational tasks with less energy.

Our designs are compared with existing approaches for LiM (i.e., based on magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs), CMOS, etc.) that afford the same circuit-level functionality. Assuming similar feature sizes, non-volatile FeFET-based LiM circuits are more efficient than functional equivalents based on MTJs when considering metrics such as propagation delay (2.9\u00d7, 6.8\u00d7) and dyanmic power (3.7\u00d7, 2.3\u00d7) (for 45 nm, 22 nm technology respectively).

Application characteristics and hardware non-idealities of conventional architectures (optimized for the nominal voltage) prevent us from fully leveraging the potential of NTC systems. Further, the popular approach of increasing the computational core count to compensate for the performance loss severely burdens the on-chip communication fabric with an increased communication demand. In this work, we quantitatively analyze the performance bottleneck created by a conventional NoC architecture in many-core NTC systems. To reclaim the performance lost due to a sub-optimal NoC, we propose BoostNoC - a power efficient, multi-layered network-on-chip architecture. BoostNoC improves the system performance by nearly 2\u00d7 over a conventional NTC system. Further, we improve the energy efficiency by 1.4\u00d7 with the use of drowsy routers.","doi":"10.1145/2966986.2967009","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Computer-Aided Design (ICCAD)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Computer-Aided Design (ICCAD)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7787013/7827541/07827701.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1145/2966986.2967009","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7827541","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"BoostNoC: Power efficient network-on-chip architecture for near threshold computing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7827701","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-10 Nov. 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7827701/","displayDocTitle":"BoostNoC: Power efficient network-on-chip architecture for near threshold computing","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2016","accessionNumber":"16618781","htmlLink":"/document/7827701/","conferenceDate":"7-10 Nov. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"23 January 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"BoostNoC: Power efficient network-on-chip architecture for near threshold computing","confLoc":"Austin, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"9D_3.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073352S","chronDate":"7-10 Nov. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7787013","isNumber":"7827541","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7787013","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7827541","articleId":"7827701","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ACM","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7827718,"authors":[{"name":"Javad Gholinezhad","affiliation":["Faculty of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Birjand, Birjand, Iran"],"firstName":"Javad","lastName":"Gholinezhad","id":"37703958000"},{"name":"Mahmoud Ebadian","affiliation":["Faculty of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Birjand, Birjand, Iran"],"firstName":"Mahmoud","lastName":"Ebadian","id":"37393178900"},{"name":"Mohammad R.

Despite the many advantages that their introduction into the grid has, it may cause some problems. One of the problems is increasing the short-circuit current and the loss of protective devices coordination. To deal with this problem, many different approaches have been proposed. One of the best promising approaches of resolving the problem is using a fault current limiter (FCL) to limit DG's current during a short circuit fault. In this paper, a parallel-resonance-type fault current limiter is used in the interconnection point of the DG to the grid to keep its current at its pre-fault value during a short circuit fault. A comparative study is carried out through the short-circuit tests to demonstrate the superiority of using this kind of FCL over the conventional resonance-type one. The novelty of this paper is that by using the mentioned FCL, operating times of the recloser and fuse will be maintained at their values before the introduction of DG. So, the recloser-fuse coordination can be restored with higher coincidence with the pre-introduction of DG condition. Furthermore, using this kind of FCL has less effect on the normal system condition.","doi":"10.1109/IPSC.2015.7827747","publicationTitle":"2015 30th International Power System Conference (PSC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 30th International Power System Conference (PSC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7811889/7827713/07827747.pdf","startPage":"190","endPage":"194","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7827713","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IPSC.2015.7827747","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Application of a parallel-resonance-type FCL for maintaining the recloser-fuse coordination in a power distribution system with a dispersed generation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7827747/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-25 Nov. 2015","displayDocTitle":"Application of a parallel-resonance-type FCL for maintaining the recloser-fuse coordination in a power distribution system with a dispersed generation","htmlLink":"/document/7827747/","dateOfInsertion":"23 January 2017","publicationDate":"Nov. 2015","accessionNumber":"16618894","conferenceDate":"23-25 Nov. 2015","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Application of a parallel-resonance-type FCL for maintaining the recloser-fuse coordination in a power distribution system with a dispersed generation","confLoc":"Tehran, Iran","sourcePdf":"30.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.074614S","chronDate":"23-25 Nov. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7811889","isNumber":"7827713","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7811889","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7827713","articleId":"7827747","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7827750,"authors":[{"name":"Sadegh Hesari","affiliation":["Amirkabir University of Technology, Tehran, lran"],"firstName":"Sadegh","lastName":"Hesari","id":"37085443305"},{"name":"Mohammad Bagher Naghibi Sistani","affiliation":["Ferdowsi University, Mashhad, lran"],"firstName":"Mohammad Bagher Naghibi","lastName":"Sistani","id":"37400029100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2705-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2706-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7827750","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":267},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Induction motors","Optimization","Torque","Mathematical model","Rotors","Algorithm design and analysis","Genetic algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["energy conservation","energy consumption","fuzzy control","genetic algorithms","induction motors","machine vector control","magnetic flux","rotors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fuzzy-genetic algorithm","induction motor efficiency improvement","electric energy consumption optimization","energy saving","electric energy consumption reduction","motor flux","inductive motor loss","rotor flux vector control"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["induction motor","Loss Minimization","genetic algorithm","fuzzy logic"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7827750","abstract":"In most industrial zones, electric energy is one of the most important energy sources. Since electrical motors are the main energy consumers of industrial factories, consumption optimization in these motors can be considered as a main option related to energy saving. One very effective way to reduce the consumption of these equipment is to use a motor speed controllers or drives. Since the loss of inductive motor has a direct relationship with motor flux, in this paper, the rotor flux vector control has been used. Due to the strength of fuzzy controllers in load failure and noise generation states, this controller has been used to adjust the drive speed. Two fuzzy logic inputs including speed error and speed variation derivative, and a fuzzy output, motor reference torque (Te*) are estimated. The genetic optimization algorithm has been used in order to improve the Efficiency and reduce the losses. As such, the drive performance in GA and Fuzzy-Genetic (FG) states is reviewed and the simulation results are presented. Finally, the obtained results in this paper have been compared to the results of FOC inductive motor with PI controller and without optimization. It can be seen that when FG method is employed, the results show a higher performance and losses are reduced up to almost 40 to 50% in different loads, and the amount of input power is also reduced up to approximately 30%.","doi":"10.1109/IPSC.2015.7827750","startPage":"210","endPage":"216","publicationTitle":"2015 30th International Power System Conference (PSC)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IPSC.2015.7827750","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7827713","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 30th International Power System Conference (PSC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7811889/7827713/07827750.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficiency improvement of induction motor using fuzzy-genetic algorithm","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7827750/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Efficiency improvement of induction motor using fuzzy-genetic algorithm","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7827750/","accessionNumber":"16618886","publicationDate":"Nov. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"23 January 2017","conferenceDate":"23-25 Nov. 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-25 Nov. 2015","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficiency improvement of induction motor using fuzzy-genetic algorithm","confLoc":"Tehran, Iran","sourcePdf":"33.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.082558S","chronDate":"23-25 Nov. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7811889","isNumber":"7827713","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7811889","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7827713","articleId":"7827750","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":7827771,"authors":[{"name":"Sadegh Etemad","affiliation":["School of Computer Engineering, Iran University of Science and Technology, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Sadegh","lastName":"Etemad","id":"37086136897"},{"name":"Nasser Mozayani","affiliation":["School of Computer Engineering, Iran University of Science and Technology, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Nasser","lastName":"Mozayani","id":"37320696000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2705-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2706-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7827771","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":509},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7827771","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Batteries","Learning (artificial intelligence)","Microgrids","Wind turbines","Load modeling","Renewable energy sources"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed power generation","learning (artificial intelligence)","power engineering computing","power generation faults","power generation reliability","power supply quality","power system stability","power transmission lines","wind power"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["smart energy storage source","reinforcement learning","microgrid","power transmission line","power generation fault","voltage drop","power system reliability","electrical stability","power quality","peak power load improvement","production uncertainty","consumer battery","wind energy random nature"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["reinforcement learning","microgrid","renewable energy","battery","Q learning","intelligence agent"]}],"abstract":"The use of renewable energy in power generation, sudden changes in load and fault in power transmission lines, causing a voltage drop in the system and challenge the reliability of the system.

Privacy is measured as the variation of the power withdrawn from the grid from a fixed target value. Assuming non-causal knowledge of the household's aggregate power demand profile and the electricity prices at the energy management unit (EMU), the privacy-cost trade-off is formulated as a convex optimization problem, and a low-complexity backward water-filling algorithm is proposed to compute the optimal EM policy. The problem is studied also in the online setting assuming that the power demand profile is known to the EMU only causally, and the optimal EM policy is obtained numerically through dynamic programming (DP). Due to the high computational cost of DP, a low-complexity heuristic EM policy with a performance close to the optimal online solution is also proposed, exploiting the water-filling algorithm obtained in the offline setting. As an alternative, information theoretic leakage rate is also evaluated, and shown to follow a similar trend as the load variance, which supports the validity of the load variance as a measure of privacy. Finally, the privacy-cost trade-off, and the impact of the size of the storage unit on this trade-off are studied through numerical simulations using real smart meter data in both the offline and online settings.","doi":"10.1109/TIFS.2017.2656469","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7867904","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIFS.2017.2656469","endPage":"1469","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security","pdfPath":"/iel7/10206/7867904/07827910.pdf","startPage":"1458","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Privacy-Cost Trade-offs in Demand-Side Management With Storage","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 January 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7827910/","displayDocTitle":"Privacy-Cost Trade-offs in Demand-Side Management With Storage","volume":"12","issue":"6","accessionNumber":"16741798","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7827910/","publicationDate":"June 2017","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Catalan Government","grantNumber":"SGR2014-1567"},{"fundingName":"Spanish Government (INTENSYV)","grantNumber":"TEC2013-44591-P"},{"fundingName":"European Unions Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Programme","grantNumber":"646469"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000266","fundingName":"U.K. Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)","grantNumber":"EP/NO21738/1"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Privacy-Cost Trade-offs in Demand-Side Management With Storage","sourcePdf":"tifs-tan-2656469-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.106709S","chronDate":"June  2017","xplore-pub-id":"10206","isNumber":"7867904","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10206","citationCount":"34","xplore-issue":"7867904","articleId":"7827910","onlineDate":"20 January 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7827928,"authors":[{"name":"Mina Taheri","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, New Jersey Institute of Technology"],"bio":{"p":["Mina Taheri Hosseinabadi received the B.Sc degree in electrical engineering with a focus on electronics, the M.Sc degree in electrical engineering with a specialization in communication (network) from Isfahan University of Technology (IUT) in 2007 and 2010, respectively, and a Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from New Jersey Institute of Technology (NJIT), Newark in 2016.

Train-to-ground communications mostly suffers from frequent handoffs due to the high mobility of the trains. To provision high-speed Internet services in HSTs, we propose a novel solution named Free-space OptiCs Utilization in high-Speed trains (FOCUS). Our solution takes advantage of the high optical bandwidth of free space optics (FSO) to provide high data rates. FOCUS aims to improve the trainto- ground communications system by deploying on-roof FSO transceivers. To minimize the number of handoff processes, the control unit inside the train forwards each request to go through the proper transceiver. The proposed mechanism decreases the packet loss ratio and increases network performance in high-speed train communications.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7994878","publicationTitle":"IEEE Network","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Network","pdfPath":"/iel7/65/7994878/07827928.pdf","doi":"10.1109/MNET.2017.1600167NM","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MNET.2017.1600167NM","startPage":"96","endPage":"101","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Provisioning Internet Access Using FSO in High-Speed Rail Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 January 2017","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"July-August  2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7827928/","displayDocTitle":"Provisioning Internet Access Using FSO in High-Speed Rail Networks","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7827928/","volume":"31","issue":"4","accessionNumber":"17063237","dateOfInsertion":"28 July 2017","publicationDate":"July-August 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Provisioning Internet Access Using FSO in High-Speed Rail Networks","sourcePdf":"022ANSARI_LAYOUT.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.03957S","chronDate":"July-August  2017","xplore-pub-id":"65","isNumber":"7994878","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"65","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"7994878","articleId":"7827928","onlineDate":"20 January 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-09"},{"_id":7827956,"authors":[{"name":"A.

Stacks of noise cross correlations are now routinely used to extract empirical Green's functions between station pairs. In regional and global scale studies, mostly surface waves are extracted due to their dominance in seismic noise wave fields. Group arrival times measured from the time-frequency representation of frequency dispersive surface waves are further used in tomographic inversions to image seismic structure. Often, the group arrivals are not clearly identified or ambiguous depending on the signal and noise characteristics. Here, we present a procedure to robustly measure group velocities using the time-frequency domain phase-weighted stack (PWS) combined with data resampling and decision strategies. The time-frequency PWS improves signal extraction through incoherent signal attenuation during the stack of the noise cross correlations. Resampling strategies help to identify signals robust against data variations and to assess their errors. We have gathered these ingredients in an algorithm where the decision strategies and tuning parameters are reduced for semiautomated processing schemes. Our numerical and field data examples show a robust assignment of surface-wave group arrivals. The method is computational efficient thanks to an implementation based on pseudoanalytic frames of wavelets and enables processing large amounts of data.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7864502","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2016.2631445","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel7/36/7864502/07828001.pdf","startPage":"1928","endPage":"1935","doi":"10.1109/TGRS.2016.2631445","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Measuring Group Velocity in Seismic Noise Correlation Studies Based on Phase Coherence and Resampling Strategies","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2017","displayDocTitle":"Measuring Group Velocity in Seismic Noise Correlation Studies Based on Phase Coherence and Resampling Strategies","volume":"55","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/7828001/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"April 2017","accessionNumber":"16706659","dateOfInsertion":"24 February 2017","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7828001/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 January 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Project MISTERIOS","grantNumber":"CGL2013-48601-C2-1-R"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001665","fundingName":"MIMOSA","grantNumber":"ANR-14-CE01-0012"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000921","fundingName":"COST Action ES1401 TIDES"},{"fundingName":"AGAUR"},{"fundingName":"FP7 Marie Curie Project through SV\u2019s Beatriu de Pinos Fellowship","grantNumber":"600385"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Measuring Group Velocity in Seismic Noise Correlation Studies Based on Phase Coherence and Resampling Strategies","sourcePdf":"tgrs-schimmel-2631445-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.080561S","chronDate":"April  2017","xplore-pub-id":"36","isNumber":"7864502","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"7864502","articleId":"7828001","onlineDate":"20 January 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-04"},{"_id":7828005,"authors":[{"name":"Yong-Hun Kim","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejeon, Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8919/7887772/7828005/ykim-2630119-small.gif","p":["Yong-Hun Kim (S\u201913-16) received the B.S and M.S degrees in electrical engineering from the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST), Daejeon, South Korea in 2011 and 2013, respectively, and he is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree in electronic engineering from KAIST, Daejeon.","His research interests include mixed-signal IC design for wireline communications, high speed serial links, and system design for equalization."]},"firstName":"Yong-Hun","lastName":"Kim","id":"37066738600"},{"name":"Taeho Lee","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejeon, Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8919/7887772/7828005/tlee-2630119-small.gif","p":["Taeho Lee (S\u201913-15) received the B.S. degree in electrical and electronic engineering from Yonsei University, Seoul, South Korea, in 2010, the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST), Daejeon, South Korea in 2012 and 2016, respectively.","He is currently working in Samsung electronics, Hwasung, South Korea, since 2016.

However, the resolution of captured depth image is much lower than that of its corresponding color image, which affects its application performance. In this paper, we propose a novel depth map super-resolution (SR) method by taking view synthesis quality into account. The proposed approach mainly includes two technical contributions. First, since the captured low-resolution (LR) depth map may be corrupted by noise and occlusion, we propose a credibility based multi-view depth maps fusion strategy, which considers the view synthesis quality and interview correlation, to refine the LR depth map. Second, we propose a view synthesis quality based trilateral depth-map up-sampling method, which considers depth smoothness, texture similarity and view synthesis quality in the up-sampling filter. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art depth SR methods for both super-resolved depth maps and synthesized views. Furthermore, the proposed method is robust to noise and achieves promising results under noise-corruption conditions.","doi":"10.1109/TIP.2017.2656463","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/83/7864504/07828010.pdf","startPage":"1732","endPage":"1745","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIP.2017.2656463","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7864504","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Depth Map Super-Resolution Considering View Synthesis Quality","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7828010","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 January 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7828010/","displayDocTitle":"Depth Map Super-Resolution Considering View Synthesis Quality","volume":"26","issue":"4","publicationDate":"April 2017","accessionNumber":"16706717","pubMedId":"28113341","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7828010/","dateOfInsertion":"24 February 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61271324, 61520106002, 61471262, 91320201 and 61672378"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Depth Map Super-Resolution Considering View Synthesis Quality","sourcePdf":"tip-yue-2656463-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.169374S","chronDate":"April  2017","xplore-pub-id":"83","isNumber":"7864504","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"33","xplore-issue":"7864504","articleId":"7828010","onlineDate":"20 January 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7828014,"authors":[{"name":"Youbao Tang","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Technology, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/83/7855880/7828014/tang-2656474-small.gif","p":["Youbao Tang received the B.S. and M.Sc. degrees in computer science from Harbin Institute of Technology (HIT), Harbin, China, in 2009 and 2011 respectively, where he is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree in computer science.

This paper proposes a novel method for scene text detection and segmentation based on cascaded convolution neural networks (CNNs). In this method, a CNN-based text-aware candidate text region (CTR) extraction model (named detection network, DNet) is designed and trained using both the edges and the whole regions of text, with which coarse CTRs are detected. A CNN-based CTR refinement model (named segmentation network, SNet) is then constructed to precisely segment the coarse CTRs into text to get the refined CTRs. With DNet and SNet, much fewer CTRs are extracted than with traditional approaches while more true text regions are kept. The refined CTRs are finally classified using a CNN-based CTR classification model (named classification network, CNet) to get the final text regions. All of these CNN-based models are modified from VGGNet-16. Extensive experiments on three benchmark data sets demonstrate that the proposed method achieves the state-of-the-art performance and greatly outperforms other scene text detection and segmentation approaches.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Scene Text Detection and Segmentation Based on Cascaded Convolution Neural Networks","doi":"10.1109/TIP.2017.2656474","startPage":"1509","endPage":"1520","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIP.2017.2656474","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7855880","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/83/7855880/07828014.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7828014","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 January 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7828014/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2017","displayDocTitle":"Scene Text Detection and Segmentation Based on Cascaded Convolution Neural Networks","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"26","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/7828014/","dateOfInsertion":"29 March 2017","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 2017","accessionNumber":"16772272","pubMedId":"28113342","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61472102 and 61672194"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Scene Text Detection and Segmentation Based on Cascaded Convolution Neural Networks","sourcePdf":"tip-wu-2656474-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.137183S","chronDate":"March  2017","xplore-pub-id":"83","isNumber":"7855880","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"57","xplore-issue":"7855880","articleId":"7828014","onlineDate":"20 January 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7828015,"authors":[{"name":"Jin Jin","affiliation":["School of Information and Engineering, Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/7859429/7828015/jin-2656558-small.gif","p":["Jin Jin received the Ph.D. degree in communications and information systems from Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China, in 2014.

In this paper, we show that using n \u2265 3 time slots, the achievable DoF is (n - 1)M/n, which is higher than the previous result of 2M/3 DoF for the case of n \u2265 4. The achievability is shown by a new relaying protocol, which combines the alternate transmission strategy with an interference cancellation technique. A major implication of the derived result is that a normalized DoF of one can be achieved asymptotically without requiring global CSI at the source and relay nodes.","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2656558","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/7859429/07828015.pdf","startPage":"1376","endPage":"1381","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2656558","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7859429","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Achievable Degrees of Freedom for the Two-Cell Two-Hop MIMO Interference Channel With Half-Duplex Relays","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7828015","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 January 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7828015/","displayDocTitle":"Achievable Degrees of Freedom for the Two-Cell Two-Hop MIMO Interference Channel With Half-Duplex Relays","volume":"5","publicationDate":"2017","accessionNumber":"16720324","isOpenAccess":true,"isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7828015/","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61501404"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004605","fundingName":"Startup Research Fund of Zhengzhou University","grantNumber":"1512318005"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004543","fundingName":"China Scholarship Council"},{"fundingName":"China National 863 Project","grantNumber":"2014AA01A705"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61640003 and U1204607"},{"fundingName":"Outstanding Young Talent Research Fund of ZZU","grantNumber":"1521318003"},{"fundingName":"Major Projects in Henan Province","grantNumber":"161100210200"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003488","fundingName":"Doctoral Scientific Funds of Henan Polytechnic University","grantNumber":"B2016-34"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61571402"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Achievable Degrees of Freedom for the Two-Cell Two-Hop MIMO Interference Channel With Half-Duplex Relays","sourcePdf":"access-jin-2656558-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.060775S","chronDate":"2017","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"7859429","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"7859429","articleId":"7828015","onlineDate":"20 January 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7828023,"authors":[{"name":"Nir Shlezinger","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, Be\u2019er-Sheva, Israel"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/7900485/7828023/shlez-2655526-small.gif","p":["Nir Shlezinger (S\u201914) received the B.Sc. and M.Sc. degrees in electrical and computer engineering from Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, Israel, in 2011 and 2013, respectively, where he is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering.

In many practical digital communications scenarios, including, for example, interference-limited wireless and wireline communications, as well as narrowband power line communications, the considered signals are jointly cyclostationary. Yet, most works on adaptive filtering of cyclostationary signals used ad hoc application of adaptive algorithms designed for stationary signals, e.g., the least-mean-squares (LMS). It is known that these algorithms may not converge for jointly cyclostationary signals. In this paper, we rigorously study the optimal adaptive filtering of jointly cyclostationary signals. We first identify the relevant objective as the time-averaged mean-squared error criterion (TA-MSE), and obtain an adaptive algorithm as the stochastic approximation of the TA-MSE minimizer. When the considered signals are jointly stationary, the algorithm specializes to the standard LMS algorithm. We provide a comprehensive transient and steady-state performance analysis without imposing a specific distribution on the considered signals, and derive conditions for convergence and stability. The algorithm, which we call time-averaged LMS, is applied to practical scenarios in a simulations study, and an excellent agreement between the theoretical and the empirical performance is observed.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2017.2655526","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7900485","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2017.2655526","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/7900485/07828023.pdf","startPage":"1746","endPage":"1761","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive Filtering Based on Time-Averaged MSE for Cyclostationary Signals","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 January 2017","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive Filtering Based on Time-Averaged MSE for Cyclostationary Signals","volume":"65","issue":"4","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2017","dateOfInsertion":"14 April 2017","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7828023/","publicationDate":"April 2017","accessionNumber":"16808446","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7828023/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Ministry of Economy of Israel through the Israeli Smart Grid Consortium"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003977","fundingName":"Israel Science Foundation","grantNumber":"1685/16"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive Filtering Based on Time-Averaged MSE for Cyclostationary Signals","sourcePdf":"tcomm-shlezinger-2655526-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.127054S","chronDate":"April  2017","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"7900485","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"7900485","articleId":"7828023","onlineDate":"20 January 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7828028,"authors":[{"name":"Francesco Setti","affiliation":["Vision, Image Processing and Sound Laboratory, University of Verona, Verona, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/76/8425815/7828028/setti-2656718-small.gif","p":["Francesco Setti received the M.S. degree in mechatronics engineering from the University of Trento, Trento, Italy, in 2006, and the Ph.D. degree in mechanical measurements from the University of Padua, Padua, Italy, in 2010.

In this paper, we provide a solid solution to this task using a differential geometry approach, operating on Lie algebra, and exploiting a mixture of templates. The proposed method asks the user to locate a few instances of the target patterns (seeds) that become visual templates used to explore the image. We propose an iterative algorithm to locate patches similar to the seeds working in three steps: first, clustering the detected patches to generate templates of different classes, then looking for the affine transformations, living on a Lie algebra that best links the templates and the detected patches, and finally detecting new patches with a convolutional strategy. The process ends when no new patches are found. We will show how our method is able to process heterogeneous unstructured images with multiple visual motifs and extremely crowded scenarios with high precision and recall, outperforming all the state-of-the-art methods.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8425815","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSVT.2017.2656718","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/76/8425815/07828028.pdf","startPage":"1798","endPage":"1806","doi":"10.1109/TCSVT.2017.2656718","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Count on Me: Learning to Count on a Single Image","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2018","displayDocTitle":"Count on Me: Learning to Count on a Single Image","volume":"28","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/7828028/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2018","accessionNumber":"17974436","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2018","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7828028/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 January 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Count on Me: Learning to Count on a Single Image","sourcePdf":"tcsvt-setti-2656718-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.095341S","chronDate":"Aug.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"76","isNumber":"8425815","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"76","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"8425815","articleId":"7828028","onlineDate":"20 January 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":7828037,"authors":[{"name":"Jiawei Xu","affiliation":["Holst Centre, Eindhoven, The Netherlands"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4664312/8241891/7828037/xu-2656388-small.gif","p":["Jiawei Xu (M'14) received the M.Sc. and Ph.D. degrees from Delft\n University of Technology, Delft, The Netherlands, in 2006 and 2016, respectively, both in microelectronics.","Since 2006, he has been with imec/Holst Centre, Eindhoven, The Netherlands, where he has developed ICs for\n low-power ECG and EEG acquisition.

The proposed method hinges on a chance-constrained AC OPF formulation, where probabilistic constraints are utilized to enforce voltage regulation with prescribed probability. A computationally more affordable convex reformulation is developed by resorting to suitable linear approximations of the AC power-flow equations as well as convex approximations of the chance constraints. The approximate chance constraints provide conservative bounds that hold for arbitrary distributions of the forecasting errors. An adaptive strategy is then obtained by embedding the proposed AC OPF task into a model predictive control framework. Finally, a distributed solver is developed to strategically distribute the solution of the optimization problems across utility and customers.","chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/59/8012582/7828060-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7828060/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 January 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7828060/","dateOfInsertion":"17 August 2017","publicationDate":"Sept. 2017","accessionNumber":"17121841","volume":"32","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Chance-Constrained AC Optimal Power Flow for Distribution Systems With Renewables","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000015","fundingName":"U.S. Department of Energy","grantNumber":"DE-AC36-08GO28308"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100006233","fundingName":"National Renewable Energy Laboratory"},{"fundingName":"Laboratory Directed Research and Development Program at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory"},{"fundingName":"Grid Modernization Laboratory Consortium"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","chorusFlag":"true","title":"Chance-Constrained AC Optimal Power Flow for Distribution Systems With Renewables","sourcePdf":"tpwrs-dallanese-2656080-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.466301S","chronDate":"Sept.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"59","isNumber":"8012582","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"53","xplore-issue":"8012582","articleId":"7828060","onlineDate":"20 January 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":7828061,"authors":[{"name":"Yongkai Huo","affiliation":["College of Computer Science and Software Engineering, Shenzhen University, Shenzhen, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/8008868/7828061/huo-2656798-small.gif","p":["Yongkai Huo received the B.Eng. degree with distinction in computer\n science and technology from Hefei University of Technology, Hefei, China, in 2006; the M.Eng. degree in computer\n software and theory from University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, in 2009; and the Ph.D. degree from the\n Wireless Communications Group, School of Electronics and Computer Science, University of Southampton, Southampton,\n U.K., in 2014.","He was a Research Fellow until September 2016 with the University of Southampton.

Since the conventional enhancement techniques developed for bit-flipping decoding require soft information, the long latency taken to generate the soft information, makes it hard to apply them to practical NAND storage systems. The proposed algorithm requires only hard information and achieves the better performance than previous hard-information-based algorithms. The proposed method flips multiple bits in each iteration, but the maximum number of bits to be flipped in an iteration is restricted to prevent overcorrection. To relax the hardware complexity of sorting, in addition, an efficient approximation method is proposed, reducing the hardware complexity of a 512-input sorter by 48.3% without degrading the performance noticeably.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7828079/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 January 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2017","volume":"21","issue":"5","dateOfInsertion":"08 May 2017","publicationDate":"May 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7828079/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Multi-Bit Flipping Decoding of LDPC Codes for NAND Storage Systems","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"MSIP as GFP","grantNumber":"CISS-2011-0031860"},{"fundingName":"SK Hynix"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multi-Bit Flipping Decoding of LDPC Codes for NAND Storage Systems","sourcePdf":"lcomm-park-2656119-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.111866S","chronDate":"May  2017","xplore-pub-id":"4234","isNumber":"7921536","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4234","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"7921536","articleId":"7828079","onlineDate":"20 January 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Letter","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7828081,"authors":[{"name":"Minghai Qin","affiliation":["WDC Research, Milpitas, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Minghai","lastName":"Qin","orcid":"0000-0001-5172-5309","id":"37086037767"},{"name":"Jing Guo","affiliation":["Department of Engineering, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, U.K."],"firstName":"Jing","lastName":"Guo","id":"37076035000"},{"name":"Aman Bhatia","affiliation":["SK Hynix Memory Solutions, San Jose, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Aman","lastName":"Bhatia","id":"38241557000"},{"name":"Albert Guill\u00e9n i F\u00e0bregas","affiliation":["Department of Engineering, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, U.K.","Instituci\u00f3 Catalana de Recerca i Estudis Avan\u00e7ats, Barcelona, Spain","Department of Information and Communication Technologies, Universitat Pompeu Fabra, Barcelona, Spain"],"firstName":"Albert","lastName":"Guill\u00e9n i F\u00e0bregas","id":"37562950700"},{"name":"Paul H.

Thus application aware OMP algorithm implementation is important. In this paper, we propose two different modifications to OMP algorithm named Thresholding technique for OMP (tOMP) and Gradient Descent OMP (GDOMP) to reduce hardware complexity of OMP algorithm. tOMP modifies identification stage of OMP algorithm to reduce reconstruction time and GDOMP modifies residual update phase to reduce chip area. To demonstrate reconstruction efficiency of proposed OMP modifications, we compare signal-to-reconstruction error rate (SRER), signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), and Structural Similarity index (SSIM) of previously proposed matching pursuit algorithms such as Subspace Pursuit (SP), Look Ahead OMP (LAOMP), and OMP, with tOMP, and GDOMP. We implemented reconfigurable, parallel, and pipelined architectures for three algorithms including OMP, tOMP, and GDOMP which can reconstruct different data vector sizes ranging from 128 to 1024, on 65 nm CMOS technology operating at 1 V supply voltage. The post place and route analysis on area, power, and latency show that, tOMP requires 33% less reconstruction time, and GDOMP consumes 44% less chip area when compared to OMP ASIC implementation. Compared to previously published work, the proposed architectures achieve 2.1 times improvement in Area-Delay product (ADP) and consume 40% less energy.","doi":"10.1109/TCSI.2017.2648854","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSI.2017.2648854","startPage":"1468","endPage":"1480","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","pdfPath":"/iel7/8919/7934110/07828082.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7934110","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Low Overhead Architectures for OMP Compressive Sensing Reconstruction Algorithm","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7828082/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 January 2017","displayDocTitle":"Low Overhead Architectures for OMP Compressive Sensing Reconstruction Algorithm","volume":"64","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"25 May 2017","accessionNumber":"16918006","publicationDate":"June 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7828082/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low Overhead Architectures for OMP Compressive Sensing Reconstruction Algorithm","sourcePdf":"tcsi-kulkarni-2648854-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.114253S","chronDate":"June  2017","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"7934110","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"40","xplore-issue":"7934110","articleId":"7828082","onlineDate":"20 January 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7828088,"authors":[{"name":"Zhong Zheng","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Texas at Dallas, Richardson, TX, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/7900485/7828088/zheng-2656129-small.gif","p":["Zhong Zheng (S\u201910\u2013M\u201915) received the B.Eng. degree from the Beijing University of Technology, China, in 2007, the M.Sc. degree from the Helsinki University of Technology, Finland, in 2010, and the D.Sc. degree from Aalto University, Finland, in 2015.

To best serve the communicating nodes, the node clusters are continuously reconfigured due to the node mobility and varying channel conditions. The frequency of reconfiguration depends on the required system performance, exhibiting a tradeoff between performance and complexity. We propose a practical node selection scheme, which activates only a small subset of transmitters. We evaluate the asymptotic performance of the scheme as a function of the number of recruited nodes, demonstrating that there is an optimal number of such nodes. Compared with the system that blindly activates all available transmitting nodes, our results show that the proposed RD-MIMO architecture with node selection achieves superior performance, especially as evident at low SNR. Furthermore, assuming the Brownian motion model, an analytical expression for the reconfiguration time to select a new cluster of transmitting nodes is obtained. Numerical results show that the obtained expression serves as a good estimation for the order of magnitude of the cluster reconfiguration time for other mobility patterns, such as the random walk model.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2017.2656129","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7900485","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2017.2656129","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/7900485/07828088.pdf","startPage":"1609","endPage":"1622","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the Performance of Reconfigurable Distributed MIMO in Mobile Networks","chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/26/7900485/7828088-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 January 2017","displayDocTitle":"On the Performance of Reconfigurable Distributed MIMO in Mobile Networks","volume":"65","issue":"4","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2017","dateOfInsertion":"14 April 2017","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7828088/","publicationDate":"April 2017","accessionNumber":"16808431","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7828088/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"NSF","grantNumber":"ECCS-1308208 and ECCS-1533282"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","chorusFlag":"true","title":"On the Performance of Reconfigurable Distributed MIMO in Mobile Networks","sourcePdf":"tcomm-zheng-2656129-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.158042S","chronDate":"April  2017","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"7900485","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"7900485","articleId":"7828088","onlineDate":"20 January 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7828093,"authors":[{"name":"Hua Shen","affiliation":["School of Computer Science, Hubei University of Technology, Wuhan, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/10206/7867904/7828093/hshen-2656475-small.gif","p":["Hua Shen received the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees from Wuhan University, Wuhan, China, in 2007 and 2014, respectively.

However, data concerning user's electricity consumption might reveal sensitive information, such as living habits and lifestyles. In order to solve this problem, this paper proposes a privacy-preserving cube-data aggregation scheme for electricity consumption. In our scheme, a data item is described as a multi-dimensional data structure (l-dimensional), and users form and live in multiple residential areas (m areas, and at most n users in each area). Based on Horner's Rule, for each user, we construct a user-level polynomial to store dimensional values in a single data space by using the first Horner parameter. After embedding the second Horner parameter into the polynomial, the polynomial is hidden by using Paillier cryptosystem. By aggregating data from m areas, we hide the area-level polynomial into the final output. Moreover, we propose a batch verification scheme in multi-dimensional data to reduce authentication cost. Finally, our analysis shows that the proposed scheme is efficient in terms of computation and communication costs, suitable for massive user groups, and supports the flexible and rapid growth of residential scales in smart grids.","doi":"10.1109/TIFS.2017.2656475","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security","pdfPath":"/iel7/10206/7867904/07828093.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIFS.2017.2656475","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7867904","startPage":"1369","endPage":"1381","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient Privacy-Preserving Cube-Data Aggregation Scheme for Smart Grids","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7828093","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Efficient Privacy-Preserving Cube-Data Aggregation Scheme for Smart Grids","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7828093/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 January 2017","isJournal":true,"volume":"12","issue":"6","publicationDate":"June 2017","accessionNumber":"16721078","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7828093/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61370224 and 61672010"},{"fundingName":"CICAEET fund"},{"fundingName":"PAPD fund"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient Privacy-Preserving Cube-Data Aggregation Scheme for Smart Grids","sourcePdf":"tifs-zhang-2656475-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.092982S","chronDate":"June  2017","xplore-pub-id":"10206","isNumber":"7867904","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10206","citationCount":"57","xplore-issue":"7867904","articleId":"7828093","onlineDate":"20 January 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-22"},{"_id":7828097,"authors":[{"name":"Gaojie Chen","affiliation":["Department of Engineering Science, University of Oxford, Oxford, U.K"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/10206/7862329/7828097/chen-2656462-small.gif","p":["Gaojie Chen (S\u201909\u2013M\u201912) received the B.

We compare the cases, where the receiving user equipment (UE) operates in half-duplex (HD) mode and full-duplex (FD) mode. In the latter case, the UE simultaneously receives the intended downlink message and transmits a jamming signal to strengthen secrecy. We investigate two models of (semi)passive eavesdropping: 1) EDs act independently and 2) EDs collude to intercept the transmitted message. For both of these models, we obtain expressions for the secrecy outage probability in the downlink for the HD and FD UE operation. The expressions for the HD systems have very accurate approximate or exact forms in terms of elementary and/or special functions for all path loss exponents. Those related to the FD systems have exact integral forms for general path loss exponents, while exact closed forms are given for specific exponents. A closed-form approximation is also derived for the FD case with colluding EDs. The resulting analysis shows that the reduction in the secrecy outage probability is logarithmic in the number of antennas used for TAS and identifies conditions, under which HD operation should be used instead of FD jamming at the UE. These performance trends and exact relations between system parameters can be used to develop adaptive power allocation and duplex operation methods in practice. Examples of such techniques are alluded to herein.","doi":"10.1109/TIFS.2017.2656462","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security","pdfPath":"/iel7/10206/7862329/07828097.pdf","startPage":"1195","endPage":"1206","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7862329","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIFS.2017.2656462","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Secrecy Outage Analysis for Downlink Transmissions in the Presence of Randomly Located Eavesdroppers","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7828097","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2017","displayDocTitle":"Secrecy Outage Analysis for Downlink Transmissions in the Presence of Randomly Located Eavesdroppers","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7828097/","isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"May 2017","dateOfInsertion":"06 May 2019","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"16690589","htmlLink":"/document/7828097/","volume":"12","issue":"5","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 January 2017","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000266","fundingName":"Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council","grantNumber":"EP/N002350/1 (\u201cSpatially Embedded Networks\u201d)"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Secrecy Outage Analysis for Downlink Transmissions in the Presence of Randomly Located Eavesdroppers","sourcePdf":"tifs-chen-2656462-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.105527S","chronDate":"May  2017","xplore-pub-id":"10206","isNumber":"7862329","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10206","citationCount":"62","xplore-issue":"7862329","articleId":"7828097","onlineDate":"20 January 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7828099,"authors":[{"name":"Hiroki Okada","affiliation":["Department of Applied Mathematics and Physics, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/10206/7862329/7828099/okada-2656473-small.gif","p":["Hiroki Okada received the B.Sc. degree in informatics from Kyoto University, Japan, in 2014, and the M.Sc. degree in informatics from the Department of Applied Mathematics and Physics, Graduate School of Informatics, Kyoto University, in 2016.

The most crucial problem in the DFT test is that its reference distribution of the test statistic is not derived mathematically but rather numerically estimated; the DFT test for randomness is based on a pseudo-random number generator (PRNG). Therefore, the present DFT test should not be used unless the reference distribution is mathematically derived. Here, we prove that a power spectrum, which is a component of the test statistic, follows a chi-squared distribution with two degrees of freedom. Based on this fact, we propose a test, whose reference distribution of the test statistic is mathematically derived. Furthermore, the results of testing non-random sequences and several PRNGs showed that the proposed test is more reliable and definitely more sensitive than the present DFT test.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Randomness Evaluation With the Discrete Fourier Transform Test Based on Exact Analysis of the Reference Distribution","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security","doi":"10.1109/TIFS.2017.2656473","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security","pdfPath":"/iel7/10206/7862329/07828099.pdf","startPage":"1218","endPage":"1226","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIFS.2017.2656473","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7862329","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7828099","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7828099/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 January 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2017","displayDocTitle":"Randomness Evaluation With the Discrete Fourier Transform Test Based on Exact Analysis of the Reference Distribution","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"12","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/7828099/","dateOfInsertion":"22 February 2017","publicationDate":"May 2017","accessionNumber":"16690591","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Randomness Evaluation With the Discrete Fourier Transform Test Based on Exact Analysis of the Reference Distribution","sourcePdf":"tifs-okada-2656473-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.085111S","chronDate":"May  2017","xplore-pub-id":"10206","isNumber":"7862329","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10206","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"7862329","articleId":"7828099","onlineDate":"20 January 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7828102,"authors":[{"name":"Chao Bu","affiliation":["College of Software, Northeastern University, Shenyang, China"],"firstName":"Chao","lastName":"Bu","orcid":"0000-0003-2918-4643","id":"37086293021"},{"name":"Xingwei Wang","affiliation":["College of Software, Northeastern University, Shenyang, China"],"firstName":"Xingwei","lastName":"Wang","orcid":"0000-0003-2856-4716","id":"37085557064"},{"name":"Min Huang","affiliation":["College of Information Science and Engineering, Northeastern University, Shenyang, China"],"firstName":"Min","lastName":"Huang","id":"37273546000"},{"name":"Keqin Li","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, State University of New York, New Paltz, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Keqin","lastName":"Li","id":"37086290273"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-7798"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2558"},{"format":"CD","value":"2373-7891"}],"articleNumber":"7828102","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":10,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":612},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7828102","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Network function virtualization","Software","Control systems","Internet","Real-time systems","Bandwidth","Security"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer network management","Internet","software defined networking","virtualisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distinctive communication demands","diversified network applications","special packet processing operations","dynamic network function deployment model","diverse network functions","special-purpose communication features","dynamic network function deployment mechanism","appropriate functions","requested functions","Internet","packet forwarding","software defined networking","network function virtualization","network status"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Software defined networking","network function virtualization","function deployment","prediction"]}],"abstract":"Oriented to the distinctive communication demands of diversified network applications, the current Internet should be able to provide special packet processing operations beyond simple packet forwarding.

As the DAQ works under harsh radiation environment, there is a fair chance of data corruption due to various energetic particles like alpha, beta, or neutron. Hence, a major challenge in the development of DAQ in the HEP experiment is to establish an error resilient communication system between front-end sensors or detectors and back-end data processing computing nodes. Here, we have implemented the DAQ using field-programmable gate array (FPGA) due to some of its inherent advantages over the application-specific integrated circuit. A novel orthogonal concatenated code and cyclic redundancy check (CRC) have been used to mitigate the effects of data corruption in the user data. Scrubbing with a 32-b CRC has been used against error in the configuration memory of FPGA. Data from front-end sensors will reach to the back-end processing nodes through multiple stages that may add an uncertain amount of delay to the different data packets. We have also proposed a novel memory management algorithm that helps to process the data at the back-end computing nodes removing the added path delays. To the best of our knowledge, the proposed FPGA-based DAQ utilizing optical link with channel coding and efficient memory management modules can be considered as first of its kind. Performance estimation of the implemented DAQ system is done based on resource utilization, bit error rate, efficiency, and robustness to radiation.","doi":"10.1109/TNS.2017.2656464","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","pdfPath":"/iel7/23/7890364/07828104.pdf","startPage":"933","endPage":"944","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7890364","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNS.2017.2656464","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An FPGA-Based High-Speed Error Resilient Data Aggregation and Control for High Energy Physics Experiment","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 January 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7828104/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2017","displayDocTitle":"An FPGA-Based High-Speed Error Resilient Data Aggregation and Control for High Energy Physics Experiment","htmlLink":"/document/7828104/","dateOfInsertion":"30 March 2017","publicationDate":"March 2017","accessionNumber":"16775458","isJournal":true,"volume":"64","issue":"3","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Bose Institute Indo FAIR Coordination Committee, India"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002781","fundingName":"TEQIP-II project, University of Calcutta"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An FPGA-Based High-Speed Error Resilient Data Aggregation and Control for High Energy Physics Experiment","sourcePdf":"tns-mandal-2656464-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.13227S","chronDate":"March  2017","xplore-pub-id":"23","isNumber":"7890364","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7890364","articleId":"7828104","onlineDate":"20 January 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7828105,"authors":[{"name":"Ali Khoshniat","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Utah State University, Logan, UT, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5503870/7843693/7828105/khosh-2646484-small.gif","p":["Ali Khoshniat received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering from the K.

Due to the limited capacity of backhaul, less power should be allocated to users whose requested contents do not exist in the local caches to maximize the performance of caching. In this paper, power allocation is considered to improve the performance of cache-aided small-cell networks with limited backhaul, where interference alignment is used to manage interferences among users. Specifically, three power allocation algorithms are proposed. First, we come up with a power allocation algorithm to maximize the sum transmission rate of the network, considering the limitation of backhaul. Second, to have more users meet their rate requirements, a power allocation algorithm to minimize the average outage probability is also proposed. Third, to further improve the users' experience, a power allocation algorithm that maximizes the average satisfaction of all users is also designed. Simulation results are provided to show the effectiveness of the three proposed power allocation algorithms for cache-aided small-cell networks with limited backhaul.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Power Allocation for Cache-Aided Small-Cell Networks With Limited Backhaul","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2656384","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/7859429/07828114.pdf","startPage":"1272","endPage":"1283","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2656384","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7859429","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7828114","topic":"Wireless Cachiing Technique for 5G","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7828114/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 January 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"2017","displayDocTitle":"Power Allocation for Cache-Aided Small-Cell Networks With Limited Backhaul","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"5","htmlLink":"/document/7828114/","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"2017","accessionNumber":"16720384","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"Xinghai Scholars Program and National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61671101"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"51678108"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61501045"},{"fundingName":"State Major Science and Technology Special Projects","grantNumber":"2016ZX03001017-004"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Power Allocation for Cache-Aided Small-Cell Networks With Limited Backhaul","sourcePdf":"access-zhao-2656384-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.091906S","chronDate":"2017","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"7859429","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"7859429","topics":["Wireless Cachiing Technique for 5G"],"articleId":"7828114","onlineDate":"20 January 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7828118,"authors":[{"name":"Pydi Ganga Bahubalindruni","affiliation":["IIITD, Okhla Industrial Estate, Phase III, New Delhi, India","CENIMAT/I3N, Universidade Nova de Lisboa and CEMOP-UNINOVA, Caparica, Portugal"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8919/7907349/7828118/bahub-2635442-small.gif","p":["Pydi Ganga Bahubalindruni received the Ph.D. degree from the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, FEUP/INESC, Portugal, in 2014.

Experiments were set to show summation of up to four signals. However, the design can easily be expanded to add higher number of signals, by appending a single TFT at the input per each additional signal. The circuit is simple, uses a single power supply irrespective to the number of input voltage signals, and shows good accuracy over a reasonable range of input values. By choosing proper TFT dimensions, the topology can replace the typical output drivers of TFT amplifiers, namely the common-drain with current source biasing, or the common-source with diode connected load. The circuit was fabricated with a temperature that does not exceeds 200 \u00b0C. Its performance is characterized from measurements at room temperature and normal ambient, with a power supply voltage of 12 V and a load of \u2248 4 pF. The proposed circuit has shown a linearity error less than 3.2% (up to an input signal peak-to-peak value of 2 V), a power consumption of 78 \u03bcW and a bandwidth of 115 kHz, under worst case condition (when it is adding four signals with the same frequency). It has shown superior performance in terms of linearity when compared to the typical drivers considered in this study. In addition, it has shown almost the same behavior when measurements were repeated after one year. Therefore, the proposed circuit is a robust viable alternative to conventional approaches, being more compact, and contributes to increase the functionality of large-area flexible electronics.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7828118/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 January 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2017","volume":"64","issue":"5","accessionNumber":"16823929","dateOfInsertion":"24 April 2017","publicationDate":"May 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7828118/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A Low-Power Analog Adder and Driver Using a-IGZO TFTs","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Low-Power Analog Adder and Driver Using a-IGZO TFTs","sourcePdf":"tcsi-bahubalindruni-2635442-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.084905S","chronDate":"May  2017","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"7907349","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"7907349","articleId":"7828118","onlineDate":"20 January 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7828121,"authors":[{"name":"Wenbin Cheng","affiliation":["Zhongshan Institute, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Zhongshan, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/7859429/7828121/cheng-2656378-small.gif","p":["Wenbin Cheng received the M.S. degree in electric engineering from the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, China, in 2006.

In practice, data graphs can be extremely large, e.g., a Web-scale graph containing billions of vertices. The state-of-the-art approaches employ centralized algorithms to process graph keyword searches, and thus they are infeasible for such large graphs, due to the limited computational power and storage space of a centralized server. To address this problem, we investigate keyword search for Web-scale graphs deployed in a distributed environment. We first give a naive search algorithm to answer the query efficiently. However, the naive search algorithm uses a flooding search strategy that incurs large time and network overhead. To remedy this shortcoming, we then propose a signature-based search algorithm. Specifically, we design a vertex signature that encodes the shortest-path distance from a vertex to any given keyword in the graph. As a result, we can find query answers by exploring fewer paths, so that the time and communication costs are low. Moreover, we reorganize the graph data in the cluster after its initial random partitioning so that the signature-based techniques are more effective. Finally, our experimental results demonstrate the feasibility of our proposed approach in performing keyword searches over Web-scale graph data.","doi":"10.1109/TKDE.2017.2656079","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering","startPage":"1212","endPage":"1225","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on

high force density, easy maintenance, rapid dynamic response, and so on. This paper proposes an LVPMM structure, which has a similar secondary as that of a regular linear PM machine, while its primary mover is composed of three modules, and the modules are separated by flux barriers. Since high-precision servo systems have rigorous demands on the force ripple of the drive motors, two methods are introduced to minimize the force ripple of the LVPMM. One is to choose an optimal length of flux barriers; the other is to change the three-phase winding connection. The effectiveness of both methods is verified by time-stepping finite element analysis. It is found that the force ripple can be reduced from 10.6% to 2.4% by the proposed two methods.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","pdfPath":"/iel7/20/7934107/07828128.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","doi":"10.1109/TMAG.2017.2656178","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMAG.2017.2656178","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7934107","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7828128","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Force Ripple Minimization of a Linear Vernier Permanent Magnet Machine for Direct-Drive Servo Applications","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Force","Forging","Windings","Optimization","Servomotors","Induction motors","Permanent magnet motors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dynamic response","finite element analysis","linear machines","machine windings","motor drives","permanent magnet machines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["force ripple minimization","linear vernier permanent magnet machine","LVPMM structure","direct-drive servo applications","dynamic response","flux barriers","drive motors","three-phase winding connection","time-stepping finite element analysis"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cogging force","finite element analysis (FEA)","linear vernier permanent magnet (LVPM) machine","servo application"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7828128/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 January 2017","displayDocTitle":"Force Ripple Minimization of a Linear Vernier Permanent Magnet Machine for Direct-Drive Servo Applications","volume":"53","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/7828128/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"June 2017","accessionNumber":"16914058","dateOfInsertion":"25 May 2017","externalId":"7001905","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Force Ripple Minimization of a Linear Vernier Permanent Magnet Machine for Direct-Drive Servo Applications","sourcePdf":"tmag-li-2656178-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.09491S","chronDate":"June  2017","xplore-pub-id":"20","isNumber":"7934107","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"20","citationCount":"34","xplore-issue":"7934107","articleId":"7828128","onlineDate":"20 January 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7828132,"authors":[{"name":"Behnam Tayebi","affiliation":["Department of Brain and Cognitive Engineering, Korea University, Seoul, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/3516/8293754/7828132/tayeb-2656160-small.gif","p":["Behnam Tayebi received the B.Sc. and M.Sc. degrees in solid state\n physics from K.N.

In general, monitoring multiple objects with fixed optical resolution in a total area larger than the sensor size of the camera requires asynchronous scanning; therefore, the recorded images of different scanned areas are asynchronous. We have developed a novel single-shot triple field of view (FOV) interferometric technique that rectifies this asynchronous problem and the effect of high-frequency noise due to the motorized scanning components utilized to extend imaging area. The proposed technique is a novel setup, calibration, and correction algorithm that facilitates a wider 3-D imaging area and higher mechanical stability with fixed imaging parameters. In addition, objects are exposed to a low-power light source and images can be formed with lower intensity light, which is important for sensitive objects in practical applications. The technique separates the light exiting a microscope using four mirrors, which results in all beams having the same intensity and the recorded image possessing a higher fringe contrast than with techniques that use beam splitters. Furthermore, the arrangement it adopts, in which a pinhole is employed to produce a clear reference beam, makes it appropriate for complex industrial fabrication monitoring. A sub-Nyquist sampling scheme is also employed to facilitate recording of the maximum possible FOV for single-shot three holograms recording, and the phase retrieval process is modified to refocus the beam on different image planes. The feasibility of the proposed technique for monitoring multiple biological cells with different morphologies is demonstrated by using it to image human embryonic kidney 293 cells.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Real-Time Triple Field of View Interferometry for Scan-Free Monitoring of Multiple Objects","publicationTitle":"IEEE/ASME Transactions on Mechatronics","doi":"10.1109/TMECH.2017.2656160","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE/ASME Transactions on Mechatronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/3516/8293754/07828132.pdf","startPage":"160","endPage":"166","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMECH.2017.2656160","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8293754","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7828132","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7828132/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 January 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2018","displayDocTitle":"Real-Time Triple Field of View Interferometry for Scan-Free Monitoring of Multiple Objects","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"23","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/7828132/","dateOfInsertion":"16 February 2018","publicationDate":"Feb. 2018","accessionNumber":"17581401","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Ministry of Science, ICT, and Future Planning (MSIP)"},{"fundingName":"Institute for Information and Communications Technology Promotion (IITP)","grantNumber":"IITP-2016-R2720-16-0007"},{"fundingName":"Korea University Future Research Grant"},{"fundingName":"BK21 Plus Global Leader Development Division"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Real-Time Triple Field of View Interferometry for Scan-Free Monitoring of Multiple Objects","sourcePdf":"tmech-han-2656160-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.081015S","chronDate":"Feb.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"3516","isNumber":"8293754","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3516","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"8293754","articleId":"7828132","onlineDate":"20 January 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7828139,"authors":[{"name":"Amin Khalili Moghaddam","affiliation":["Faculty of Engineering, University of Malaya, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8919/7887772/7828139/mogha-2623821-small.gif","p":["Amin Khalili Moghaddam (S\u201916) received the B.Eng. degree in electrical electronics engineering from Islamic Azad University, Bojnord, Iran, in 2004 and the M.Eng degree in telecommunications from University of Malaya (UM), Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, in 2009.

The conventional source-to-body, and the proposed technique known as Lower DC Feeding (LDCF), were fabricated in the 130-nm CMOS and compared at the operation frequency of 500 MHz, 953 MHz and 2 GHz along with a corresponding load of 2 kQ, 10 kQ and 50 kQ. The technique allows the PMOS transistors to operate with a dynamic threshold voltage (V\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">th</sub>\n) which improves the power conversion efficiency (PCE) when the rectifier is operating at a smaller received power. A 9.5% of improvement is achieved at the peak PCE when the rectifier is operating at 953 MHz, and driving a 10 kQ load. A maximum PCE of 73.9% is measured at 2 GHz when driving a 2-kQ load. The LDCF technique also offers a self-limiting capability for its output voltage, by reducing the PCE at larger received power. A limit-voltage level of 3.5 V is measured irrespective to the operating frequency and load. This capability aids the protection of the subsequent circuits in a wireless sensor from being overpowered.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7828139/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 January 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2017","volume":"64","issue":"4","accessionNumber":"16775956","dateOfInsertion":"27 March 2017","publicationDate":"April 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7828139/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A 73.9%-Efficiency CMOS Rectifier Using a Lower DC Feeding (LDCF) Self-Body-Biasing Technique for Far-Field RF Energy-Harvesting Systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A 73.9%-Efficiency CMOS Rectifier Using a Lower DC Feeding (LDCF) Self-Body-Biasing Technique for Far-Field RF Energy-Harvesting Systems","sourcePdf":"tcsi-ramiah-2623821-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.136239S","chronDate":"April  2017","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"7887772","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"45","xplore-issue":"7887772","articleId":"7828139","onlineDate":"20 January 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7828141,"authors":[{"name":"Yousef Atoum","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Michigan State University, East Lansing, MI, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6046/7949123/7828141/atoum-2656064-small.gif","p":["Yousef Atoum received the B.S. degree in computer engineering from\n Yarmouk University, Irbid, Jordan, in 2009, the M.S. degree in electrical and computer engineering from Western\n Michigan University, Kalamazoo, MI, USA, in 2012, and is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree in electrical and\n computer engineering at Michigan State University, East Lansing, MI, USA.","His research interests include object tracking, computer vision, and pattern recognition."]},"firstName":"Yousef","lastName":"Atoum","id":"37085345692"},{"name":"Liping Chen","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Michigan State University, East Lansing, MI, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6046/7949123/7828141/chen-2656064-small.gif","p":["Liping Chen received the B.S. degree in information and computational\n mathematics from the Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Nanjing, China, in 2006, and is currently\n working toward the M.S. degree in computer science and engineering and the Ph.D. degree in mathematics at Michigan\n State University, East Lansing, MI, USA.","His research interests include numerical analysis, tensor eigenvalue, and computer vision."]},"firstName":"Liping","lastName":"Chen","id":"37086157520"},{"name":"Alex X.

The ability to efficiently proctor remote online examinations is an important limiting factor to the scalability of this next stage in education. Presently, human proctoring is the most common approach of evaluation, by either requiring the test taker to visit an examination center, or by monitoring them visually and acoustically during exams via a webcam. However, such methods are labor intensive and costly. In this paper, we present a multimedia analytics system that performs automatic online exam proctoring. The system hardware includes one webcam, one wearcam, and a microphone for the purpose of monitoring the visual and acoustic environment of the testing location. The system includes six basic components that continuously estimate the key behavior cues: user verification, text detection, voice detection, active window detection, gaze estimation, and phone detection. By combining the continuous estimation components, and applying a temporal sliding window, we design higher level features to classify whether the test taker is cheating at any moment during the exam. To evaluate our proposed system, we collect multimedia (audio and visual) data from $\\text{24}$ subjects performing various types of cheating while taking online exams. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the accuracy, robustness, and efficiency of our online exam proctoring system.","doi":"10.1109/TMM.2017.2656064","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Multimedia","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Multimedia","pdfPath":"/iel7/6046/7949123/07828141.pdf","startPage":"1609","endPage":"1624","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7949123","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMM.2017.2656064","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Automated Online Exam Proctoring","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7828141","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2017","displayDocTitle":"Automated Online Exam Proctoring","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7828141/","publicationDate":"July 2017","dateOfInsertion":"15 June 2017","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"16970128","htmlLink":"/document/7828141/","volume":"19","issue":"7","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 January 2017","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Michigan State University Targeted Support Grants for Technology Development program"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Automated Online Exam Proctoring","sourcePdf":"tmm-liu-2656064-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.08046S","chronDate":"July  2017","xplore-pub-id":"6046","isNumber":"7949123","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6046","citationCount":"34","xplore-issue":"7949123","articleId":"7828141","onlineDate":"20 January 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7828153,"authors":[{"name":"Elissa D.

Stair ascent experiments were performed with three unilateral transfemoral amputee subjects, comparing the oxygen consumption required to ascend stairs using the powered prosthesis (with a step-over gait), relative to using their daily-use energetically passive prostheses (with a step-to gait). Results indicate on average a 24% reduction in oxygen consumption and a 30% reduction in stair ascent timewhen using the powered prosthesis, relative to when using the passive prostheses. All subjects expressed a strong preference for ascending stairs using the powered prosthesis.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Systems and Rehabilitation Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel7/7333/8000746/07828153.pdf","startPage":"917","endPage":"924","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Systems and Rehabilitation Engineering","doi":"10.1109/TNSRE.2017.2656467","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNSRE.2017.2656467","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8000746","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7828153","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Control and Evaluation of a Powered Transfemoral Prosthesis for Stair Ascent","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Prosthetics","Knee","Legged locomotion","Torque","Protocols","Steady-state","Foot"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["gait analysis","medical disorders","prosthetics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["powered transfemoral prosthesis","metabolic effort","transfemoral amputee","powered knee prosthesis","powered ankle prosthesis","stair ascent biomechanics","passive prosthesis","oxygen consumption"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Powered prosthetics","transfemoral prosthesis","amputees","stair ascent","metabolics","unsteady-state"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Artificial Limbs","Electric Power Supplies","Equipment Design","Equipment Failure Analysis","Exoskeleton Device","Feedback","Female","Gait","Humans","Leg","Male","Middle Aged","Oxygen Consumption","Pilot Projects","Reproducibility of Results","Robotics","Sensitivity and Specificity","Treatment Outcome"]}],"chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/7333/8000746/7828153-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7828153/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 January 2017","displayDocTitle":"Control and Evaluation of a Powered Transfemoral Prosthesis for Stair Ascent","volume":"25","issue":"7","htmlLink":"/document/7828153/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"July 2017","accessionNumber":"17136248","pubMedId":"28113346","dateOfInsertion":"03 August 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship","grantNumber":"DGE-1445197"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","chorusFlag":"true","title":"Control and Evaluation of a Powered Transfemoral Prosthesis for Stair Ascent","sourcePdf":"tnsre-ledoux-2656467-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.094735S","chronDate":"July  2017","xplore-pub-id":"7333","isNumber":"8000746","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7333","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"8000746","articleId":"7828153","onlineDate":"20 January 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7828156,"authors":[{"name":"Teklemariam Tsegay Tesfay","affiliation":["Laboratory for Communications and Applications 2, \u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5165411/8443168/7828156/tesfa-2656067-small.gif","p":["Teklemariam Tsegay Tesfay received the B.Sc. degree in computer science and engineering from the Mekelle Institute of Technology, Ethiopia, in 2007, and the M.Sc. degree in computer science and engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology Bombay, India, in 2009.

One of the biggest challenges for multicast in smart grid is ensuring source authentication without violating the stringent time requirement. The research community and standardization bodies have proposed several authentication mechanisms for smart grid multicast applications. In this paper, we evaluate different authentication schemes and identify the best candidates for phasor data communication in wide area monitoring systems (WAMS). We first do an extensive literature review of existing solutions and establish a short list of schemes to evaluate. Second, we make an experimental comparison of the chosen schemes in an operational smart grid pilot and evaluate the performance of these schemes by using the following metrics: computation, communication, and key management overheads. The best candidates we consider are two variants of ECDSA, TV-HORS and three variants of incomplete-key-set. We find ECDSA without pre-computed tokens and all the incomplete-key-set variants are inapplicable for WAMS due to their high computation overhead. The ECDSA variant that uses pre-computed tokens and TV-HORS perform well in all metrics; however, TV-HORS has potential drawbacks due to a large key management overhead as a result of the frequent distribution of a large public key per source.","doi":"10.1109/TSG.2017.2656067","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid","pdfPath":"/iel7/5165411/8443168/07828156.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSG.2017.2656067","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8443168","startPage":"4394","endPage":"4404","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Experimental Comparison of Multicast Authentication for Wide Area Monitoring Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7828156","chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/5165411/8443168/7828156-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Experimental Comparison of Multicast Authentication for Wide Area Monitoring Systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7828156/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 January 2017","isJournal":true,"isOpenAccess":true,"volume":"9","issue":"5","publicationDate":"Sept. 2018","accessionNumber":"18042612","dateOfInsertion":"21 August 2018","htmlLink":"/document/7828156/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Nano-Tera Swiss National Science Foundation Project S3-Grids"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","chorusFlag":"true","title":"Experimental Comparison of Multicast Authentication for Wide Area Monitoring Systems","sourcePdf":"tsg-tesfay-2656067-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.159198S","chronDate":"Sept.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"5165411","isNumber":"8443168","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5165411","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"8443168","articleId":"7828156","onlineDate":"20 January 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7828170,"authors":[{"name":"Peng Huang","affiliation":["Institute of Microelectronics, Peking University, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/16/7828063/7828170/huang-2643162-small.gif","p":["Peng Huang (M\u201916) received the B.S. degree from Xidian University, Xi\u2019an, China, in 2010, and the Ph.D. degree in microelectronics from Peking University, Beijing, China, in 2015.","He is currently a Post-Doctoral Associate with the Institute of Micro-electronics, Peking University.

To meet the codesign requirement of HfOx-based electronic synapses with CMOS neurons in the neuromorphic computing systems, a compact model that can capture the synaptic futures of HfOx-based resistive switching device is developed. The developed model can accurately describe the multilevel conductance transition behaviors during RESET process for depression learning as well as the binary stochastic transition behavior during SET process for potentiation learning. After the verification with experimental data, the model is used to simulate a winner-take-all neural network to classify patterns with unsupervised competitive learning algorithm. Simulation results imply that the average recognition accuracy would decrease with the increase of the resistance variation of low resistance state (LRS) due to the \u201ctrap\u201d effect. Guided by the simulation, a synapse cell consisted of a HfOX-based device and a fixed resistor series connection is proposed to achieve almost 100% recognition accuracy even if the resistance variation of LRS is 50%.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7828170/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 January 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2017","volume":"64","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"20 January 2017","publicationDate":"Feb. 2017","accessionNumber":"16618179","htmlLink":"/document/7828170/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Compact Model of HfO<sub><i>X</i></sub>-Based Electronic Synaptic Devices for Neuromorphic Computing","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61334007, 61421005 and 61404006"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Compact Model of HfO<sub><italic>X</italic></sub>-Based Electronic Synaptic Devices for Neuromorphic Computing","sourcePdf":"ted-huang-2643162-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.120939S","chronDate":"Feb.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"16","isNumber":"7828063","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"29","xplore-issue":"7828063","articleId":"7828170","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7828208,"authors":[{"name":"Peng Liu","affiliation":["School of Automation, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, China, and the Key Laboratory of Image Processing and Intelligent Control of Education Ministry of China, Wuhan 430074, P.R.C. liupengjz@163.com"],"firstName":"Peng","lastName":"Liu"},{"name":"Zhigang Zeng","affiliation":["School of Automation, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, China, and the Key Laboratory of Image Processing and Intelligent Control of Education Ministry of China, Wuhan 430074, P.R.C. zgzeng@hust.edu.cn"],"firstName":"Zhigang","lastName":"Zeng"},{"name":"Jun Wang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, City University of Hong Kong, Kowloon, Hong Kong jwang.cs@cityu.edu.hk"],"firstName":"Jun","lastName":"Wang"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0899-7667"}],"articleNumber":"7828208","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7828208","abstract":"<para xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">This letter studies the multistability analysis of delayed recurrent neural networks with Mexican hat activation function.

Among all emerging technologies tackling these challenges, SDNs decouple the control plane from the data plane to provide network programmability, and virtualization can share network and radio resources among various applications. On the other hand, fog computing offloads computing services from the cloud to the edge of networks, offering real-time data services to nearby data terminals. In this article, we present an integrated architecture for software defined and virtualized radio access networks with fog computing. We propose a design of software as a service called OpenPipe, which enables network-level virtualization. To integrate SDNs and network virtualization with fog computing, we adopt a hybrid control model with two hierarchical control levels, where an SDN controller forms the higher level and local controllers comprise the lower level. Typical use cases of the proposed network architecture are validated through laboratory demonstrations.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Integrated Architecture for Software Defined and Virtualized Radio Access Networks with Fog Computing","publicationTitle":"IEEE Network","doi":"10.1109/MNET.2017.1600027NM","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Network","pdfPath":"/iel7/65/7828253/07828266.pdf","startPage":"80","endPage":"87","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MNET.2017.1600027NM","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7828253","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7828266","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7828266/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 January 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"January/February  2017","displayDocTitle":"An Integrated Architecture for Software Defined and Virtualized Radio Access Networks with Fog Computing","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"31","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/7828266/","dateOfInsertion":"20 January 2017","publicationDate":"January/February 2017","accessionNumber":"16618297","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Integrated Architecture for Software Defined and Virtualized Radio Access Networks with Fog Computing","sourcePdf":"014CHEN2_LAYOUT.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.047111S","chronDate":"January/February  2017","xplore-pub-id":"65","isNumber":"7828253","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"65","citationCount":"69","xplore-issue":"7828253","articleId":"7828266","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-18"},{"_id":7828267,"authors":[{"name":"Claas Lorenz","affiliation":["genua GmbH, Germany"],"bio":{"p":["Claas Lorenz (claas.lorenz@genua.de) is a security researcher at genua GmbH in Kirchheim, Germany.

Despite these attacks, the main security systems, for example network firewalls, have remained rather unchanged. In addition, new challenges arise not only to the level of provided security, but also to the scalability and manageability of the deployed countermeasures such as firewalls and intrusion detection systems. Due to the tight integration into the physical network's infrastructure, a dynamic resource allocation to adapt the security measures to the current network conditions is a difficult undertaking.

Since the solution depends on the amount of functional units available and the fault rate, fault injection and mapping were simulated considering different fault rates and architecture size. The results demonstrate that even at fault rates over 50% in functional units, the runtime mapping algorithm was able to map instructions into the architecture in most of the tested applications.

Machine learning has been successfully introduced into SpMT to improve its performance. An appropriate sample set is important for machine learning-based (ML-based) thread partition. Conventionally, heuristic rules-based (HR-based) sample generation approach can not generate adaptive samples, which conform to ML-based thread partition platform and characteristics of source applications. A hybrid sample generation approach is proposed. With this method, we firstly automatically generate samples which are mips codes consisting spawning points (SP) and control quasi-independent points (CQIP) by heuristic rules, then manually adjust the positions of SP and CQIP and rebuild pre-computation slice (p-slice) to obtain better performance for every application. During the implementation of this approach, three measures: bias weighting, reservation of optimal solutions, summary of greedy rules are carried out. In this way, we enhance the adjustment frequency for the subroutine with high called number, achieving a stable improvement of speedups. On Prophet, which is a generic SpMT processor to evaluate the performance of multithreaded programs, Olden benchmarks are used to realize the approach. Experiments show that the approach can obtain better sample sets, which deliver a better performance improvement of about 10% on a 32 core than conventional heuristic-based approach. Experiments also prove that this approach is effective to get sample sets for ML-based thread partition methods.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7828357/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 Dec. 2016","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"12-14 Dec. 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7828357/","dateOfInsertion":"26 January 2017","publicationDate":"Dec. 2016","accessionNumber":"16637526","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A Hybrid Samples Generation Approach in Speculative Multithreading","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Hybrid Samples Generation Approach in Speculative Multithreading","confLoc":"Sydney, NSW, Australia","sourcePdf":"4297a035.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069221S","chronDate":"12-14 Dec. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7819725","isNumber":"7828341","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7819725","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7828341","articleId":"7828357","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":7828389,"authors":[{"name":"Zhengguo Chen","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of High Performance Computing, National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, China"],"firstName":"Zhengguo","lastName":"Chen","id":"37085680400"},{"name":"Nong Xiao","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of High Performance Computing, National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, China","School of Data and Computer Science, Sun yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Nong","lastName":"Xiao","id":"37410882700"},{"name":"Fang Liu","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of High Performance Computing, National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, China"],"firstName":"Fang","lastName":"Liu","id":"37534563000"},{"name":"Zhiguang Chen","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of High Performance Computing, National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, China"],"firstName":"Zhiguang","lastName":"Chen","id":"37577505500"},{"name":"Wei Chen","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of High Performance Computing, National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, China"],"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Chen","id":"37597877600"},{"name":"Yuxuan Xing","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of High Performance Computing, National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, China"],"firstName":"Yuxuan","lastName":"Xing","id":"37085459649"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4297-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4298-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7828389","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":167},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Random access memory","Arrays","Flash memories","Conferences","Phase change materials","High performance computing","Computers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cache storage","DRAM chips","flash memories"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["LazyFlush","history-aware identification","cold cache lines","hot cache lines","hybrid memory system","ultra-DIMM","flash-based main memory system","DRAM","tail buffer construction","TBuffer"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Flash-based main memory system","TBuffer","History-aware identification","LazyFlush"]}],"abstract":"The Ultra-DIMM constituted by DRAM and Flash memory is a promising solution used to tackle the challenges existing in traditional DRAM in terms of energy consuming and scalability. In this hybrid memory system, DRAM is used as the data buffer of Flash memory due to the performance and endurance gaps between main memory and Flash. However, the inconsistency of access granularity between the main memory and Flash makes the DRAM-based buffer complex. On the one hand, the basic access unit of Flash is page. However, buffering pages of Flash in DRAM without distinguishing the hot cache lines from cold cache lines within each page leads to a waste of cache capacity. On the other hand, general-purpose replacement schemes focus on high hit rate and do not consider the peculiarities of Flash, thus leads to performance and lifespan overhead. In this paper, we propose TBuffer, an additional buffer in DRAM enhanced by history-aware identification and LazyFlush. History-aware identification can increase hit rate by evicting cold cache lines and keeping more hot cache lines in DRAM, while LazyFlush can further improve performance and lifespan by delaying flushing dirty objects and reducing writes to Flash. We evaluate the TBuffer via trace-driven simulations. Experimental results have shown that it outperforms other existing schemes, increases hit rate by up to 12%, reduces the access latency by a factor of up to 50.8% with an average of 19.7%, and achieves 16.6% lifespan improvement on average.","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE 18th International Conference on High Performance Computing and Communications; IEEE 14th International Conference on Smart City; IEEE 2nd International Conference on Data Science and Systems (HPCC/SmartCity/DSS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE 18th International Conference on High Performance Computing and Communications; IEEE 14th International Conference on Smart City; IEEE 2nd International Conference on Data Science and Systems (HPCC/SmartCity/DSS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7819725/7828341/07828389.pdf","startPage":"276","endPage":"283","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"TBuffer: Constructing a Tail Buffer in DRAM for Flash-Based Main Memory System","doi":"10.1109/HPCC-SmartCity-DSS.2016.0048","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7828341","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/HPCC-SmartCity-DSS.2016.0048","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7828389","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7828389/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 Dec. 2016","displayDocTitle":"TBuffer: Constructing a Tail Buffer in DRAM for Flash-Based Main Memory System","dateOfInsertion":"26 January 2017","publicationDate":"Dec. 2016","accessionNumber":"16637479","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"12-14 Dec. 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7828389/","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"TBuffer: Constructing a Tail Buffer in DRAM for Flash-Based Main Memory System","confLoc":"Sydney, NSW, Australia","sourcePdf":"4297a276.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.083713S","chronDate":"12-14 Dec. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7819725","isNumber":"7828341","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7819725","xplore-issue":"7828341","articleId":"7828389","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7828407,"authors":[{"name":"Minghui Wu","affiliation":["City College, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, P.R.China"],"firstName":"Minghui","lastName":"Wu","id":"37277238000"},{"name":"Yulong Pei","affiliation":["College of Computer Science and Technology, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, P.R.China"],"firstName":"Yulong","lastName":"Pei","id":"37085759200"},{"name":"Licheng Yu","affiliation":["College of Computer Science and Technology, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, P.R.China"],"firstName":"Licheng","lastName":"Yu","id":"38237650400"},{"name":"Tianzhou Chen","affiliation":["College of Computer Science and Technology, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, P.R.China"],"firstName":"Tianzhou","lastName":"Chen","id":"37086159370"},{"name":"Xueqing Lou","affiliation":["College of Computer Science and Technology, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, P.R.China"],"firstName":"Xueqing","lastName":"Lou","id":"37528367500"},{"name":"Tiefei Zhang","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Information Engineering, Zhejiang Gongshang University, Hangzhou, P.R.China"],"firstName":"Tiefei","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37086164456"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4297-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4298-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7828407","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":247},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7828407","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Prefetching","Graphics processing units","Bandwidth","Computer architecture","Kernel","Wireless application protocol"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cache storage","graphics processing units","microprocessor chips","multiprocessing systems","storage management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["WAP","warp feature aware prefetching method","CPU-GPU heterogeneous architecture","nongraphic computing","chip","nongraphic programs","last-level cache","LLC hit rate","memory access performance","GPGPU-sim","GEM5","CPU-GPU heterogeneous many-core simulator","MAP method","IPC"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["prefetching","LLC","GPGPU","heterogeneous architecture"]}],"abstract":"Recently, researchers discovered a GPU has some advantages for non-graphic computing.

However, it is an extremely time-consuming application which takes researchers weeks or months to run a single simulation when simulation size scales up and computing demands keep growing.

The new implementation is extended from an existing implementation (i.e., LAMMPS) which widely uses the MD application. Sunway TaihuLight is a heterogeneous supercomputer with a fully customized integration approach and a brand new many-core processor SW26010. The Sunway TaihuLight takes the world's first place with peak performance over 100PFlops. We propose an optimization method of the MD simulation in three steps: paralleled extensions to SW26010, memory-access optimizations, and vectorization. After the optimization process, an 8x speedup is achieved on a single computing node. Superiorly, we also scale up to 95 thousands computing nodes (6 millions cores) with an almost leaner speedup. Besides, the proposed methods can also be applied to many other molecular dynamics codes, or similar applications.","doi":"10.1109/HPCC-SmartCity-DSS.2016.0070","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE 18th International Conference on High Performance Computing and Communications; IEEE 14th International Conference on Smart City; IEEE 2nd International Conference on Data Science and Systems (HPCC/SmartCity/DSS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE 18th International Conference on High Performance Computing and Communications; IEEE 14th International Conference on Smart City; IEEE 2nd International Conference on Data Science and Systems (HPCC/SmartCity/DSS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7819725/7828341/07828411.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/HPCC-SmartCity-DSS.2016.0070","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7828341","startPage":"443","endPage":"450","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Implementing Molecular Dynamics Simulation on Sunway TaihuLight System","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7828411","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Implementing Molecular Dynamics Simulation on Sunway TaihuLight System","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 Dec. 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7828411/","conferenceDate":"12-14 Dec. 2016","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2016","accessionNumber":"16621950","dateOfInsertion":"26 January 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7828411/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Implementing Molecular Dynamics Simulation on Sunway TaihuLight System","confLoc":"Sydney, NSW, Australia","sourcePdf":"4297a443.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.129006S","chronDate":"12-14 Dec. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7819725","isNumber":"7828341","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7819725","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"7828341","articleId":"7828411","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7828424,"authors":[{"name":"Xiangteng Zang","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Technology, Shandong University, Jinan, P.R.

However, the high write energy impedes the adoption of MLC STT-MRAM. In this paper, we focus on reducing the write energy consumption. For a 2-bit STT-MRAM cell, the energy consumption of flipping the left bit is greater than that of flipping the right bit. Beside, writing state '01' and state '10' consumes more energy than writing states '00' and '11'. To reduce the energy consumption during MLC STT-MRAM write operations, we propose an encoding scheme to minimize the number of the left bit flips and reduce the write count of states '01' and '10' by exchanging two states with different left bit, such as states '00' and '10', when exchanging two states can reduce the total write energy consumption of a cache line. The main idea of this scheme is state remapping. The experimental results show that the encoding scheme reduces 12.17% write energy consumption on average and up to 27.58% based on the complex write scheme.","doi":"10.1109/HPCC-SmartCity-DSS.2016.0083","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/HPCC-SmartCity-DSS.2016.0083","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE 18th International Conference on High Performance Computing and Communications; IEEE 14th International Conference on Smart City; IEEE 2nd International Conference on Data Science and Systems (HPCC/SmartCity/DSS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE 18th International Conference on High Performance Computing and Communications; IEEE 14th International Conference on Smart City; IEEE 2nd International Conference on Data Science and Systems (HPCC/SmartCity/DSS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7819725/7828341/07828424.pdf","startPage":"546","endPage":"553","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7828341","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Energy Optimization for Multi-level Cell STT-MRAM Using State Remapping","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7828424/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 Dec. 2016","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Energy Optimization for Multi-level Cell STT-MRAM Using State Remapping","conferenceDate":"12-14 Dec. 2016","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"26 January 2017","publicationDate":"Dec. 2016","accessionNumber":"16621894","htmlLink":"/document/7828424/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy Optimization for Multi-level Cell STT-MRAM Using State Remapping","confLoc":"Sydney, NSW, Australia","sourcePdf":"4297a546.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065256S","chronDate":"12-14 Dec. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7819725","isNumber":"7828341","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7819725","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"7828341","articleId":"7828424","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7828429,"authors":[{"name":"Guolu Wang","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Computer Architecture, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Guolu","lastName":"Wang","id":"37086037822"},{"name":"Jungang Xu","affiliation":["School of Computer and Control Engineering, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Jungang","lastName":"Xu","id":"37675423400"},{"name":"Ben He","affiliation":["School of Computer and Control Engineering, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Ben","lastName":"He","id":"38546770200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4297-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4298-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7828429","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":37,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1451},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7828429","abstract":"Apache Spark is an open source distributed data processing platform, which can use distributed memory abstraction to process large volume of data efficiently. With the application of Apache Spark more and more widely, some problems are exposed. One of the most important aspects is the performance problem. Apache Spark has more than 180 configuration parameters, which can be adjusted by users according to their own specific application so as to optimize the performance. Currently these parameters are tuned manually by trial and error, which is ineffective due to the large parameter space and the complex interactions among the parameters. In this paper, in order to make the parameter tuning process of Spark more effective, a novel method for tuning configuration of Spark based on machine learning is proposed, which is composed of binary classification and multi-classification. This method can be used to auto-tune the configuration parameters of Spark. Furthermore, several common machine learning algorithms based on the proposed method are explored, and experimental results show that decision tree model (C5.0) is the best model considering the accuracy and computational efficiency. Finally, the experimental results also show that the performance can get average 36% gain with the proposed method compared with the default configuration of Spark.","doi":"10.1109/HPCC-SmartCity-DSS.2016.0088","startPage":"586","endPage":"593","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE 18th International Conference on High Performance Computing and Communications; IEEE 14th International Conference on Smart City; IEEE 2nd International Conference on Data Science and Systems (HPCC/SmartCity/DSS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7819725/7828341/07828429.pdf","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE 18th International Conference on High Performance Computing and Communications; IEEE 14th International Conference on Smart City; IEEE 2nd International Conference on Data Science and Systems (HPCC/SmartCity/DSS)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/HPCC-SmartCity-DSS.2016.0088","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7828341","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Novel Method for Tuning Configuration Parameters of Spark Based on Machine Learning","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sparks","Data models","Tuning","Predictive models","Computational modeling","Big data","Optimization methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data structures","decision trees","distributed processing","learning (artificial intelligence)","pattern classification","public domain software"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["tuning configuration parameters","machine learning","Apache Spark","open source distributed data processing","distributed memory abstraction","binary classification","multiclassification","decision tree model"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Apache spark","configuration parameter","machine learning"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7828429/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 Dec. 2016","displayDocTitle":"A Novel Method for Tuning Configuration Parameters of Spark Based on Machine Learning","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7828429/","publicationDate":"Dec. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"26 January 2017","conferenceDate":"12-14 Dec. 2016","accessionNumber":"16637485","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Novel Method for Tuning Configuration Parameters of Spark Based on Machine Learning","confLoc":"Sydney, NSW, Australia","sourcePdf":"4297a586.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048785S","chronDate":"12-14 Dec. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7819725","isNumber":"7828341","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7819725","citationCount":"37","xplore-issue":"7828341","articleId":"7828429","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":7828456,"authors":[{"name":"Haomiao Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Auckland, New Zealand"],"firstName":"Haomiao","lastName":"Wang","id":"37085613599"},{"name":"Jo\u00e3o Gante","affiliation":["INESC-ID, Universidade de Lisboa, Portugal"],"firstName":"Jo\u00e3o","lastName":"Gante","id":"37085428480"},{"name":"Ming Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Auckland, New Zealand"],"firstName":"Ming","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37086039417"},{"name":"Gabriel Falc\u00e3o","affiliation":["Instituto de Telecomunica\u00e7\u00f5es, University of Coimbra, Portugal"],"firstName":"Gabriel","lastName":"Falc\u00e3o","id":"37394052900"},{"name":"Leonel Sousa","affiliation":["INESC-ID, Universidade de Lisboa, Portugal"],"firstName":"Leonel","lastName":"Sousa","id":"37085573189"},{"name":"Oliver Sinnen","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Auckland, New Zealand"],"firstName":"Oliver","lastName":"Sinnen","id":"37281741300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4297-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4298-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7828456","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":243},"abstract":"High-end FPGAs are widely adopted as hardware accelerators, due to their power efficiency, flexibility, and high-performance computing ability. They are, therefore, extremely useful devices for a project with challenges and constraints such as the Square Kilometre Array (SKA). However, the traditional design methods require expert hardware knowledge and long development times for each of the SKA's target applications, making it difficult to make the most out of an array of FPGAs as a shared resource. High-level development approaches are positioned to overcome this issue. In this paper, we investigate the development efficiency and achievable performance of two popular high-level methods, Maxeler's MaxCompiler and OpenCL. They are evaluated by implementing a lengthy FIR filter with complex single precision floating-point (SPF) numbers, both in time and frequency domains (TDFIR and FDFIR, respectively). Our results show that high performance can be achieved with low development effort using such high-level methods, where OpenCL outperforms the MaxCompiler for TDFIR. OpenCL is flexible enough to develop and compare different filter approaches quickly, and as expected FDFIR based implementations clearly outperform TDFIR based ones. To demonstrate OpenCL portability and to compare performance with GPUs, the filters are also evaluated on a GPU platform. The evaluation shows that while the GPU performs better in TDFIR, is is outperformed by the FPGA in FDFIR.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Field programmable gate arrays","Finite impulse response filters","Hardware design languages","Array signal processing","Arrays","Kernel","Java"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","FIR filters","graphics processing units","parallel processing","program compilers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["high-level designs","complex FIR filters","FPGA","SKA","hardware accelerators","high-performance computing","square kilometre array","high-level methods","Maxeler MaxCompiler","single precision floating-point numbers","SPF","TDFIR","FDFIR","OpenCL portability","GPU platform"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["FIR Filters","FPGA","OpenCL","Maxeler","SKA"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7828456","doi":"10.1109/HPCC-SmartCity-DSS.2016.0115","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE 18th International Conference on High Performance Computing and Communications; IEEE 14th International Conference on Smart City; IEEE 2nd International Conference on Data Science and Systems (HPCC/SmartCity/DSS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7819725/7828341/07828456.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/HPCC-SmartCity-DSS.2016.0115","startPage":"797","endPage":"804","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7828341","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE 18th International Conference on High Performance Computing and Communications; IEEE 14th International Conference on Smart City; IEEE 2nd International Conference on Data Science and Systems (HPCC/SmartCity/DSS)","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High-Level Designs of Complex FIR Filters on FPGAs for the SKA","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"High-Level Designs of Complex FIR Filters on FPGAs for the SKA","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7828456/","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 Dec. 2016","conferenceDate":"12-14 Dec. 2016","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7828456/","dateOfInsertion":"26 January 2017","publicationDate":"Dec. 2016","accessionNumber":"16637530","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High-Level Designs of Complex FIR Filters on FPGAs for the SKA","confLoc":"Sydney, NSW, Australia","sourcePdf":"4297a797.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.075077S","chronDate":"12-14 Dec. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7819725","isNumber":"7828341","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7819725","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7828341","articleId":"7828456","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7828462,"authors":[{"name":"Zheng Xu","affiliation":["Dept. of Electronics and Information Engineering, Jiangsu, P.R.China"],"firstName":"Zheng","lastName":"Xu","id":"37085665202"},{"name":"Runbin Shi","affiliation":["Dept. of Electronics and Information Engineering, Jiangsu, P.R.China"],"firstName":"Runbin","lastName":"Shi","id":"37085658805"},{"name":"Zhihao Sun","affiliation":["Dept. of Electronics and Information Engineering, Jiangsu, P.R.China"],"firstName":"Zhihao","lastName":"Sun","id":"37085665823"},{"name":"Yaqi Li","affiliation":["Dept. of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Case Western Reserve University, USA"],"firstName":"Yaqi","lastName":"Li","id":"37085997017"},{"name":"Yuanjia Zhao","affiliation":["Dept. of Electronics and Information Engineering, Jiangsu, P.R.China"],"firstName":"Yuanjia","lastName":"Zhao","id":"37085991155"},{"name":"Chenjian Wu","affiliation":["Dept. of Electronics and Information Engineering, Jiangsu, P.R.China","Soochow University, Jiangsu, P.R.China"],"firstName":"Chenjian","lastName":"Wu","id":"37085991435"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4297-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-4298-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7828462","dbTime":"21 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":318},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hardware","Computer architecture","Parallel processing","Face detection","Real-time systems","Algorithm design and analysis","Feature extraction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image classification","learning (artificial intelligence)","multiprocessing systems","object detection","real-time systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["heterogeneous system","real-time object detection","AdaBoost algorithm","cascaded classifier","ARM Cortex-A9 processor"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["FPGA Implementation","Adaboost","Face detection","Heterogeneous system"]}],"abstract":"AdaBoost algorithm based on Haar-like features can achieves high accuracy (above 95%) in object detection. Meanwhile massive computing power is needed to implement the cascaded classifiers involved in AdaBoost detection. To solve this problem, several dedicated hardware solutions have been proposed for real-time applications. In this work, a novel heterogeneous architecture of an AdaBoost detector is presented. This architecture achieves higher performance while consuming fewer hardware resources. By combining an integrated ARM Cortex-A9 processor with a dedicated accelerator, this architecture can be configured to realize various objects detection by simply loading different parameters. 2-D parallelism is involved in accelerator unit combination which brings more flexibility. This scheme is implemented on Xilinx ZC702 platform, the experiment result shows that 40 QVGA frames per second can be achieved for real-time face detection. The accelerator achieves more than 13 times improvement over the OpenCV implementation on a standalone Cortex-A9 w.r.t execution speed.

In this paper, we present a system call analysis approach to detect malware attacks which maliciously affect the legitimate programs running in Virtual Machines (VMs) and modify their behavior. Our approach is named as 'Malicious System Call Sequence Detection (MSCSD)' which is based on analysis of short sequence of system calls (n-grams). MSCSD employs an efficient feature representation method for system call patterns to improve the accuracy of attack detection and reduce the cost of storage with reduced false positives. MSCSD applies Machine Learning (Decision Tree C 4.5) over the collected n-gram patterns for learning the behavior of monitored programs and detecting malicious system call patterns in future. We have analyzed the performance of some other classifiers and compared our work with the existing work for securing virtual machine in cloud. A prototype implementation of the approach is carried out over UNM dataset and results seem to be promising.","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE 18th International Conference on High Performance Computing and Communications; IEEE 14th International Conference on Smart City; IEEE 2nd International Conference on Data Science and Systems (HPCC/SmartCity/DSS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7819725/7828341/07828482.pdf","startPage":"991","endPage":"998","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE 18th International Conference on High Performance Computing and Communications; IEEE 14th International Conference on Smart City; IEEE 2nd International Conference on Data Science and Systems (HPCC/SmartCity/DSS)","doi":"10.1109/HPCC-SmartCity-DSS.2016.0141","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/HPCC-SmartCity-DSS.2016.0141","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7828341","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7828482","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Securing Virtual Machines from Anomalies Using Program-Behavior Analysis in Cloud Environment","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cloud computing","Security","Databases","Malware","Virtual machining","Monitoring","Virtual machine monitors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","decision trees","invasive software","learning (artificial intelligence)","pattern recognition","program diagnostics","virtual machines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["virtual machine security","program-behavior analysis","cloud environment","cloud computing","malware attacks","systems call analysis","malicious system call sequence detection","MSCSD","machine learning","decision tree C 4.5","n-gram patterns"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cloud Security","Intrusion Detection","System call Analysis","Machine Learning","Anomaly Detection"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7828482/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 Dec. 2016","displayDocTitle":"Securing Virtual Machines from Anomalies Using Program-Behavior Analysis in Cloud Environment","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7828482/","publicationDate":"Dec. 2016","accessionNumber":"16621922","dateOfInsertion":"26 January 2017","conferenceDate":"12-14 Dec. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Securing Virtual Machines from Anomalies Using Program-Behavior Analysis in Cloud Environment","confLoc":"Sydney, NSW, Australia","sourcePdf":"4297a991.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063192S","chronDate":"12-14 Dec. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7819725","isNumber":"7828341","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7819725","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"7828341","articleId":"7828482","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7828498,"authors":[{"name":"Krishna T.

Unlike vendor-specific alternatives such as CUDA, they are designed to be portable across different accelerators, and therefore once necessary directives are added to an existing CPU-only code, it can be executed on different accelerator architectures depending on the availability of supporting compilers. However, it does not automatically mean that such code runs efficiently on different architectures, and in fact, architecture-specific coding such as choosing optimal data layouts is almost mandatory for optimal performance, imposing a significant burden if implemented manually. Towards realizing performance portability in accelerator programming, we propose a set of extended directives that allow the programmer to optimize data layouts for a given accelerator without modifying original program code. Unlike the manual approach, the code change is confined in the directives with the original code kept as it is. This paper evaluates the effectiveness of our proposed extensions in the OpenACC standard by extending UPACS and CCS-QCD OpenACC applications. A prototype source-to-source translator for the extensions achieves 123% and 120% of the baseline performance, respectively, which are comparable to manually tuned versions.","doi":"10.1109/HPCC-SmartCity-DSS.2016.0161","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE 18th International Conference on High Performance Computing and Communications; IEEE 14th International Conference on Smart City; IEEE 2nd International Conference on Data Science and Systems (HPCC/SmartCity/DSS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7819725/7828341/07828502.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/HPCC-SmartCity-DSS.2016.0161","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7828341","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE 18th International Conference on High Performance Computing and Communications; IEEE 14th International Conference on Smart City; IEEE 2nd International Conference on Data Science and Systems (HPCC/SmartCity/DSS)","startPage":"1147","endPage":"1154","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"12-14 Dec. 2016","displayDocTitle":"A Directive-Based Data Layout Abstraction for Performance Portability of OpenACC Applications","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7828502/","dateOfInsertion":"26 January 2017","accessionNumber":"16621891","publicationDate":"Dec. 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7828502/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 Dec. 2016","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Directive-Based Data Layout Abstraction for Performance Portability of OpenACC Applications","confLoc":"Sydney, NSW, Australia","sourcePdf":"4297b147.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049714S","chronDate":"12-14 Dec. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7819725","isNumber":"7828341","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7819725","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7828341","articleId":"7828502","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":7828534,"authors":[{"name":"Khalid Abdulla","affiliation":["Melbourne School of Engineering, The University of Melbourne, Melbourne, VIC, Australia"],"firstName":"Khalid","lastName":"Abdulla","id":"37085595832"},{"name":"Kent Steer","affiliation":["Melbourne School of Engineering, The University of Melbourne, Melbourne, VIC, Australia"],"firstName":"Kent","lastName":"Steer","id":"37085595897"},{"name":"Andrew Wirth","affiliation":["Melbourne School of Engineering, The University of Melbourne, Melbourne, VIC, Australia"],"firstName":"Andrew","lastName":"Wirth","id":"37356591400"},{"name":"Julian De Hoog","affiliation":["IBM Res.

Getting the most value from these distributed assets is often dependent on the ability to optimize their operation in a distributed manner. This distributed optimization, in turn, calls for effective short-term forecasts of the output of small-scale generating assets, and the demand of small-scale aggregations of users. This paper introduces the integration of data-driven forecasting and operational optimization methods into a single model, avoiding the need to explicitly produce forecasts. The method is tested against two empirical energy storage operational optimization problems, the minimization of peak energy drawn by a small aggregation of customers, and the minimization of the energy costs of a collection of households which have rooftop PV systems. The integrated forecasting and operational optimization approach performs well at the peak demand minimization problem for intermediate-sized aggregations (50 residential customers or more), while an approach with separate forecasting and optimization performed better on the energy cost minimization problem. These results suggest that the integrated approach can be effective in applications where (i) forecasting difficulty is intermediate, and (ii) the exact operational optimization formulation can be well approximated by a data-driven model trained on a small fraction of the available forecast training data.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Predictive models","Optimization","Forecasting","Energy storage","Training","Minimization","Data models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed power generation","energy storage","load forecasting","minimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data-driven forecasting","distributed energy storage","energy storage operational optimization problems","peak energy minimization","energy costs minimization","rooftop PV systems","peak demand minimization problem","intermediate-sized aggregations"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["operational optimization","forecasting","energy storage","model-free control"]}],"doi":"10.1109/HPCC-SmartCity-DSS.2016.0193","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE 18th International Conference on High Performance Computing and Communications;

Moreover, by putting this data on the Cloud and providing the functionality of the DNN to other organizations, they can obtain new knowledge and can subsequently create new services. However, because such DNNs are generated from sensitive attribute values, we cannot share them freely without the explicit consent of the persons whose data are used for the DNNs. On the other hand, in recent years, e-differential privacy has emerged as the de facto privacy metric. Many researchers use e-differential privacy for privacy-preserving data mining such as correlation analysis and association rule analysis. In this paper, we modify e-differential privacy for machine learning, and we propose three approaches for creating privacy-preserved DNNs based on the modified e-differential privacy. Our proposed approaches are experimentally evaluated using a real data set, and we show that our approaches can protect personal attribute values while maintaining the accuracy of the DNNs.","doi":"10.1109/HPCC-SmartCity-DSS.2016.0202","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE 18th International Conference on High Performance Computing and Communications; IEEE 14th International Conference on Smart City; IEEE 2nd International Conference on Data Science and Systems (HPCC/SmartCity/DSS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE 18th International Conference on High Performance Computing and Communications; IEEE 14th International Conference on Smart City; IEEE 2nd International Conference on Data Science and Systems (HPCC/SmartCity/DSS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7819725/7828341/07828543.pdf","startPage":"1418","endPage":"1425","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/HPCC-SmartCity-DSS.2016.0202","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7828341","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7828543","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Privacy-Preserving Publication of Deep Neural Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 Dec. 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7828543/","displayDocTitle":"Privacy-Preserving Publication of Deep Neural Networks","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7828543/","publicationDate":"Dec. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"26 January 2017","conferenceDate":"12-14 Dec. 2016","accessionNumber":"16621880","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Privacy-Preserving Publication of Deep Neural Networks","confLoc":"Sydney, NSW, Australia","sourcePdf":"4297b418.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.105244S","chronDate":"12-14 Dec. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7819725","isNumber":"7828341","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7819725","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"7828341","articleId":"7828543","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7828548,"authors":[{"name":"Tunzi Tan","affiliation":["School of Mathematical Sciences, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing"],"firstName":"Tunzi","lastName":"Tan","id":"37086159461"},{"name":"Suixiang Gao","affiliation":["School of Mathematical Sciences, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing"],"firstName":"Suixiang","lastName":"Gao","id":"37403626200"},{"name":"Wenguo Yang","affiliation":["School of Mathematical Sciences, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing"],"firstName":"Wenguo","lastName":"Yang","id":"37086163783"},{"name":"Yuezhong Song","affiliation":["IP technology research department, Huawei Technology Co.

They have been widely used in the system security field. This paper focuses on detecting anomalous behaviors of routers by analyzing router syslogs. For syslog data pre-processing, hierarchical clustering based on counting cousin distance between event patterns is used to cluster events. In order to construct a time series, the length for a time window is set and every time window has a score related to the event clusters in it. Instead of simply treating every event cluster equally in a time window, we assign weights to every event cluster by using four term weighting methods. Two of them-inverse document frequency (IDF) and residual inverse document frequency (RIDF) methods - are widely used in the information retrieval field. Due to their drawbacks, this paper proposes two new weighting methods. The first method, IDFVAR, is a modification of the RIDF method and takes data distribution, frequency, and several additional factors into consideration. In the second method, IDFJMP, JMP value is proposed to evaluate the degree of sudden change of an event cluster. In order to compare those term weighting methods, experiments are done on an estimated data set. Then, we detect anomalous behaviors by using a method derived from standard deviation on the chosen time series. Finally, we conduct experiments on real router syslogs.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Two New Term Weighting Methods for Router Syslogs Anomaly Detection","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE 18th International Conference on High Performance Computing and Communications; IEEE 14th International Conference on Smart City; IEEE 2nd International Conference on Data Science and Systems (HPCC/SmartCity/DSS)","doi":"10.1109/HPCC-SmartCity-DSS.2016.0207","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE 18th International Conference on High Performance Computing and Communications; IEEE 14th International Conference on Smart City; IEEE 2nd International Conference on Data Science and Systems (HPCC/SmartCity/DSS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7819725/7828341/07828548.pdf","startPage":"1454","endPage":"1460","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/HPCC-SmartCity-DSS.2016.0207","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7828341","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7828548","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7828548/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 Dec. 2016","displayDocTitle":"Two New Term Weighting Methods for Router Syslogs Anomaly Detection","conferenceDate":"12-14 Dec. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7828548/","dateOfInsertion":"26 January 2017","publicationDate":"Dec. 2016","accessionNumber":"16621900","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Two New Term Weighting Methods for Router Syslogs Anomaly Detection","confLoc":"Sydney, NSW, Australia","sourcePdf":"4297b454.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.079348S","chronDate":"12-14 Dec. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7819725","isNumber":"7828341","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7819725","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7828341","articleId":"7828548","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7828562,"authors":[{"name":"Lei Xu","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Engineering, Nanjing University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Lei","lastName":"Xu","id":"37085472434"},{"name":"Jun Wang","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Engineering, Nanjing University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Jun","lastName":"Wang","id":"37086136599"},{"name":"A.

Consequently, how to resolve the resource allocation and determine the transaction pricing between CSPs and users is a big challenge. In this paper, we propose a double auction-based cloud resource allocation and pricing model, which improves the auction efficiency. In this model, the profit of the middle auctioneer is taken into consideration, and a reliability mechanism is added to the model. The price for the CSPs is designed based on the resource price and the reliability index. Finally, a resource allocation algorithm is proposed. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm reduces the number of auction rounds, and improves the auction efficiency very well.","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE 18th International Conference on High Performance Computing and Communications; IEEE 14th International Conference on Smart City; IEEE 2nd International Conference on Data Science and Systems (HPCC/SmartCity/DSS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE 18th International Conference on High Performance Computing and Communications; IEEE 14th International Conference on Smart City; IEEE 2nd International Conference on Data Science and Systems (HPCC/SmartCity/DSS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7819725/7828341/07828562.pdf","startPage":"1538","endPage":"1543","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Resource Allocation Based on Double Auction for Cloud Computing System","doi":"10.1109/HPCC-SmartCity-DSS.2016.0221","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7828341","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/HPCC-SmartCity-DSS.2016.0221","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7828562","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7828562/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 Dec. 2016","displayDocTitle":"Resource Allocation Based on Double Auction for Cloud Computing System","dateOfInsertion":"26 January 2017","publicationDate":"Dec. 2016","accessionNumber":"16637484","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"12-14 Dec. 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7828562/","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Resource Allocation Based on Double Auction for Cloud Computing System","confLoc":"Sydney, NSW, Australia","sourcePdf":"4297b538.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05889S","chronDate":"12-14 Dec. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7819725","isNumber":"7828341","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7819725","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7828341","articleId":"7828562","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7828584,"authors":[{"name":"Anatolij Bezemskij","affiliation":["Department of Computing & Information Systems, University Of Greenwich, London, United Kingdom"],"firstName":"Anatolij","lastName":"Bezemskij","id":"37085673918"},{"name":"George Loukas","affiliation":["Department of Computing & Information Systems, University Of Greenwich, London, United Kingdom"],"firstName":"George","lastName":"Loukas","id":"37423875400"},{"name":"Richard J.

This is a critical issue for autonomous vehicles; if compromised in terms of their communications or computation they can cause considerable physical damage due to their mobility. Our aim here is to facilitate the automatic detection of cyber attacks on a robotic vehicle. For this purpose, we have developed a detection mechanism, which monitors real-time data from a large number of sources onboard the vehicle, including its sensors, networks and processing. Following a learning phase, where the vehicle is trained in a non-attack state on what values are considered normal, it is then subjected to a series of different cyber-physical and physical-cyber attacks. We approach the problem as a binary classification problem of whether the robot is able to self-detect when and whether it is under attack. Our experimental results show that the approach is promising for most attacks that the vehicle is subjected to. We further improve its performance by using weights that accentuate the anomalies that are less common thus improving overall performance of the detection mechanism for unknown attacks.","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 15th International Conference on Ubiquitous Computing and Communications and 2016 International Symposium on Cyberspace and Security (IUCC-CSS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7827384/7828567/07828584.pdf","startPage":"61","endPage":"68","publicationTitle":"2016 15th International Conference on Ubiquitous Computing and Communications and 2016 International Symposium on Cyberspace and Security (IUCC-CSS)","doi":"10.1109/IUCC-CSS.2016.017","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IUCC-CSS.2016.017","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7828567","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7828584","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Behaviour-Based Anomaly Detection of Cyber-Physical Attacks on a Robotic Vehicle","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Vehicles","Robot sensing systems","ZigBee","Real-time systems","Navigation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mobile robots","pattern classification","security of data","telerobotics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["behaviour-based anomaly detection","cyber-physical attacks","robotic vehicle","physical-cyber attacks","binary classification"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["cyber-physical","intrusion detection","anomaly detection"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7828584/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-16 Dec. 2016","displayDocTitle":"Behaviour-Based Anomaly Detection of Cyber-Physical Attacks on a Robotic Vehicle","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7828584/","publicationDate":"Dec. 2016","accessionNumber":"16662263","dateOfInsertion":"23 January 2017","conferenceDate":"14-16 Dec. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Behaviour-Based Anomaly Detection of Cyber-Physical Attacks on a Robotic Vehicle","confLoc":"Granada, Spain","sourcePdf":"5566a061.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071728S","chronDate":"14-16 Dec. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7827384","isNumber":"7828567","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7827384","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"7828567","articleId":"7828584","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7828623,"authors":[{"name":"Yuliana Melita Pranoto","affiliation":["Institut Sains Terapan dan Teknologi Surabaya, Surabaya, JAwa Timur, ID"],"firstName":"Yuliana Melita","lastName":"Pranoto"},{"name":"Endang Setyati","affiliation":["Institut Sains Terapan dan Teknologi Surabaya, Surabaya, JAwa Timur, ID"],"firstName":"Endang","lastName":"Setyati"},{"name":"Edwin Pramana","affiliation":["Institut Sains Terapan dan Teknologi Surabaya, Surabaya, JAwa Timur, ID"],"firstName":"Edwin","lastName":"Pramana"},{"name":"Yosi Kristian","affiliation":["Institut Sains Terapan dan Teknologi Surabaya, Surabaya, JAwa Timur, ID"],"firstName":"Yosi","lastName":"Kristian"},{"name":"Renato Budiman","affiliation":["Institut Sains Terapan dan Teknologi Surabaya, Surabaya, JAwa Timur, ID"],"firstName":"Renato","lastName":"Budiman"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1709-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1708-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1710-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7828623","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":339},"abstract":"Mathematic is an important subject, even in our daily live we use mathematic all the time. Calculator as a major tools to help calculate mathematic formulas has become a major requirement in mobile or desktop computer use. Calculator App nowdays can handle basic to complex mathematic formulas. Meanwhile, there are more and more touchscreen-based gadgets nowdays. This simple fact sparks the idea to do a research on online handwriting-based calculator so people can directly write the formula and get the result. This paper is the first phase of research to recognize mathematic expression from user handwriting. Hidden Markov Model (HMM) algorithm is chosen because this is one of the most used algorithms in pattern recognition, such as voice recognition, handwriting recognition, POS tagging and gesture. Every input from handwriting will be processed in several phases, starts from preprocessing and feature extraction. These features will then be transformed into a form of codeword based on codebook which is built by using training data with Vector Quantization. These set of codewords are then compared with HMM models previously built with training data. Experiment was performed covering two things: feature modication experiment and codewords number experiments. Best result is gained for four features combination and 60 units of codewords.","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 International Seminar on Intelligent Technology and Its Applications (ISITIA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7811892/7828613/07828623.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","publicationTitle":"2016 International Seminar on Intelligent Technology and Its Applications (ISITIA)","doi":"10.1109/ISITIA.2016.7828623","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISITIA.2016.7828623","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7828613","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7828623","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Real time handwriting recognition for mathematic expressions using Hidden Markov Model","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hidden Markov models","Feature extraction","Training","Training data","Mathematical model","Handwriting recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["handwriting recognition","hidden Markov models","pattern recognition","vector quantisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["real time handwriting recognition","mathematic expressions","hidden Markov model","pattern recognition","voice recognition","POS tagging","feature extraction","vector quantization"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Hidden Markov Model","mathematic expression","handwriting","codebook","codeword"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7828623/","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-30 July 2016","displayDocTitle":"Real time handwriting recognition for mathematic expressions using Hidden Markov Model","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7828623/","publicationDate":"July 2016","accessionNumber":"16618963","dateOfInsertion":"23 January 2017","conferenceDate":"28-30 July 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Real time handwriting recognition for mathematic expressions using Hidden Markov Model","confLoc":"Lombok, Indonesia","sourcePdf":"A11570241075.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058513S","chronDate":"28-30 July 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7811892","isNumber":"7828613","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7811892","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7828613","articleId":"7828623","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7828625,"authors":[{"name":"Teny Handhayani","affiliation":["Faculty of Information Technology, Tarumanagara University, Jakarta, Indonesia"],"firstName":"Teny","lastName":"Handhayani","id":"37085396730"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1709-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1708-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1710-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7828625","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":101},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Histograms","Entropy","Feature extraction","Classification algorithms","Training","Image classification","Image retrieval"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feature selection","image classification"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Batik Lasem images classification","Batik Lasem motifs","features variance","statistical features selection method","voting feature intervals 5 algorithm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["VFI5","batik classification"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Batik Lasem images classification using voting feature intervals 5 and statistical features selection approach","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7828625","doi":"10.1109/ISITIA.2016.7828625","startPage":"13","endPage":"16","publicationTitle":"2016 International Seminar on Intelligent Technology and Its Applications (ISITIA)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 International Seminar on Intelligent Technology and Its Applications (ISITIA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7811892/7828613/07828625.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISITIA.2016.7828625","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7828613","abstract":"Batik Lasem has the unique pattern and it consists of the main pattern and the additional ornaments.

One way to detect alcoholics from the brain is to record the electrical activity of the brain through the scalp or called electroencephalography (EEG). EEG records are often disturbed by noise such as muscle movements, eye blinking and heartbeat. Therefore, this research suggests Independent Component Analysis (ICA), as noise removal, Stationary Wavelet Transform (SWT) as a feature extraction method and are classified into two classes, namely alcoholism and normal using Probabilistic Neural Network (PNN).

Similar to any other languages, Javanese language also has homograph words, so different pronunciations for same word can produce different meanings. This condition then may cause confusion for Javanese language learners since one of the uniqueness of Javanese language lies in the vowels and consonants pronunciation. To overcome this problem, a method to help the classification of Javanese vowels sound with convolutional neural network (CNN) is proposed. To extract the features from the audio data, Mel-frequency spectral coefficients (MFSC) is used rather than standard Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCC).

Therefore, using wavelet filter increased accuracy from 44-58% into 69-83%. Using SVM is simpler than using Neural Networks therefore could lead to convergence and shorter training time. Therefore, the system can be developed with a large training data. The classification system trained with four subjects to obtain the separation coefficient of linear hyperplane of SVM.

Using the EKF for the training NN is proved gives excellent convergence performance in many applications. Simulation of the Backpropagation algorithm is also presented. The simulation result shows that in the training data the EKF provides the performance rates 100% and requires only 1 up to 4 epochs, while the Backpropagation provides the performance rates until 93.83% and requires 20 up to 100 epochs.

However, MIMO OFDM is often troubled by Peak to Average Power Ratio (PAPR), are due to the use of the powerful amplifier with a wide dynamic range and process Analog Digital Converter (ADC) in WARP (Wireless Access Research Platform). One of the ways to reduce PAPR is to apply the techniques Partial Transmit sequence (PTS) which essentially perform differently on each sub-block treatment to reduce the PAPR of MIMO OFDM and not reduce BER performance on the system (like Clipping scheme). PAPR itself can cause interference and degradation of Bit Error Rate (BER). PTS in WARP use two antennas transmitter where each an antenna has PTS scheme.

MMG system consists of several microgrids, microgrids with generator sets and microgrids with renewable energy sources. Combination of several microgrids into MMG system can minimize the use of generator sets or traditional generator and maximize the use of microgrid with renewable energy sources. The participations of those two types of microgrids are calculated based on their characteristics. The proposed method considers the microgrid as a power source or a load.

Changes in power demand can cause oscillations inside the generator. One of the additional equipment that is used to damp the oscillation is power system stabilizer. In this paper, power system stabilizer parameter is tuned using random drift particle swarm optimization algorithm. It hopefully can improve on oscillations reduction in the single machine infinite bus model of power system. Based on previous approach, equivalent impedance in single machine infinite bus is obtained using REI-Dimo, which is relatively a complicated method. It is commonly used to model multi-machine and also a kind of method that has some parameter needed to be adjusted subjectively. In this paper, the calculation method to approach the value of equivalent impedance is conducted using losses analysis contributed by a single machine that can be calculated with a much simpler way. The simulation results of power system stabilizer tuning using random drift particle swarm optimization will be compared with the method of conventional particle swarm optimization. Based on the simulation results using drift particle swarm optimization, damping ratio can be improved better than other algorithms.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7828741/","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-30 July 2016","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"28-30 July 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7828741/","dateOfInsertion":"23 January 2017","publicationDate":"July 2016","accessionNumber":"16619003","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Optimal tuning of PSS parameters for damping improvement in SMIB model using random drift PSO and network reduction with losses concept","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal tuning of PSS parameters for damping improvement in SMIB model using random drift PSO and network reduction with losses concept","confLoc":"Lombok, Indonesia","sourcePdf":"F141570282368.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047341S","chronDate":"28-30 July 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7811892","isNumber":"7828613","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7811892","xplore-issue":"7828613","articleId":"7828741","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-10"},{"_id":7828748,"authors":[{"name":"Li Bo","affiliation":["Xi'an ASN Technology Group Co.

To enhance cooling capacity, flooded motor is generally adopted as a solution, which utilizes oil for cooling and lubrication. However, oil-film lubrication always causes severe decline of system damping ratio and deteriorates control stability. In this paper, dual-feedback control strategy is proposed to improve system damping ratio and enhance control resolution. Firstly, dynamics model of flooded motor is set up. Based on this model, the underdamping characteristic is analyzed with dual-feedback and feed-forward controller proposed. In this controller, velocity and acceleration signals forms the dual-feedback channels; feed-forward channel is also included via reference signal.

The simulation results show that VSBP neural network identifier solved the problem that BP neural network identifier can not meet the needs of the online error correction control system, improved noise immunity and reliability of the spherical actuator control system.","doi":"10.1109/CGNCC.2016.7828849","startPage":"574","endPage":"579","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE Chinese Guidance, Navigation and Control Conference (CGNCC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7819651/7828746/07828849.pdf","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE Chinese Guidance, Navigation and Control Conference (CGNCC)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CGNCC.2016.7828849","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7828746","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Uncertain parameters variable structure neural network identifier in spherical actuator control system","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Biological neural networks","Training","Actuators","Neurons","Mathematical model"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["actuators","identification","neurocontrollers","variable structure systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["uncertain parameters variable structure neural network identifier","spherical actuator control system","BP neural network identifier","VSBP neural network identifier","online error correction control system"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7828849/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 Aug. 2016","displayDocTitle":"Uncertain parameters variable structure neural network identifier in spherical actuator control system","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7828849/","publicationDate":"Aug. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"23 January 2017","conferenceDate":"12-14 Aug. 2016","accessionNumber":"16619109","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Uncertain parameters variable structure neural network identifier in spherical actuator control system","confLoc":"Nanjing, China","sourcePdf":"0265.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06106S","chronDate":"12-14 Aug. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7819651","isNumber":"7828746","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7819651","xplore-issue":"7828746","articleId":"7828849","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":7828852,"authors":[{"name":"Minghuan Zhang","affiliation":["Northwestern Polytechnical University, National Key Laboratory of Aerospace Flight Dynamics, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Minghuan","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37086182131"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-8318-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"DVD ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-0165-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-8319-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7828852","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":339},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optimization","Algorithm design and analysis","Unmanned aerial vehicles","World Wide Web","Particle swarm optimization","Simulation","Robustness"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["aerospace control","autonomous aerial vehicles","control system synthesis","particle swarm optimisation","three-term control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["PID controller design","PSO","UAV formation flight controller","unmanned aerial vehicles","particle swarm optimization","formation keeping","formation transformation","Simulink","Matlab","fuzzy controller","quasi-optimal problem"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7828852","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"PSO&PID controller design of UAV formation flight","doi":"10.1109/CGNCC.2016.7828852","startPage":"592","endPage":"596","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE Chinese Guidance, Navigation and Control Conference (CGNCC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE Chinese Guidance, Navigation and Control Conference (CGNCC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7819651/7828746/07828852.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7828746","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CGNCC.2016.7828852","abstract":"An Unmanned Aerial Vehicles(UAV) formation flight controller is presented in this paper.

Traditional compressive tracking (CT) is an efficient, fast and accurate method suitable for the real-time requirement of UAV target tracking. However, the tracking box size in it remains fixed, which is likely to bring errors quickly when the target has a big pose or scale variation. In this paper, we propose an improved multi-scale compressive tracking (IMSCT) algorithm combining compressive tracking and particle filter. IMSCT can adjust the tracking box size according to the target size variation or pose change, which decreases errors during the tracking process. The experiments show that it performs better than the original one and achieves good results in terms of accuracy, efficiency and robustness. The experiment outputs coordinates of the moving target in the image, which can be turned into yaw, pitch and roll instructions by the UAV flight control system to realize the real-time target tracking.","doi":"10.1109/CGNCC.2016.7828962","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE Chinese Guidance, Navigation and Control Conference (CGNCC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE Chinese Guidance, Navigation and Control Conference (CGNCC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7819651/7828746/07828962.pdf","startPage":"1220","endPage":"1225","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CGNCC.2016.7828962","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7828746","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Target tracking for rotor UAV based on multi-scale compressive sensing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7828962","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 Aug. 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7828962/","displayDocTitle":"Target tracking for rotor UAV based on multi-scale compressive sensing","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2016","accessionNumber":"16619171","htmlLink":"/document/7828962/","conferenceDate":"12-14 Aug. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"23 January 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Target tracking for rotor UAV based on multi-scale compressive sensing","confLoc":"Nanjing, China","sourcePdf":"0466.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066158S","chronDate":"12-14 Aug. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7819651","isNumber":"7828746","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7819651","xplore-issue":"7828746","articleId":"7828962","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7829016,"authors":[{"name":"Junpeng Shi","affiliation":["Air and Missile Defense College, Air Force Engineering University, Xi'an, China"],"lastName":"Junpeng Shi","id":"37085804887"},{"name":"Guoping Hu","affiliation":["Air and Missile Defense College, Air Force Engineering University, Xi'an, China"],"lastName":"Guoping Hu","id":"37828013600"},{"name":"Hao Zhou","affiliation":["Air and Missile Defense College, Air Force Engineering University, Xi'an, China"],"lastName":"Hao Zhou","id":"37086054193"},{"name":"Mingjun Chen","affiliation":["Unit-94921 of the PLA, Jinjiang, China"],"lastName":"Mingjun Chen","id":"37085804188"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-8318-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"DVD ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-0165-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-8319-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7829016","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":274},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO radar","Radar antennas","Receivers","Transmitters","Scattering","Entropy"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["correlation methods","electromagnetic wave scattering","entropy","MIMO radar","multipath channels","radar cross-sections","radar detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["detection model","multiple input multiple output radar","MIMO radar","multipath environment","entropy theory","multipath distance difference","MDD","multipath scattering coefficient","multipath received signal model","multipath echo power","uncertainty analysis"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["MIMO radar","Multipath Distance Difference","entropy theory","scattering coefficient"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, a novel detection model for Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO) radar based on entropy theory in multipath environment is discussed.

A velocity damping algorithm based on Kalman filter is proposed to attenuate the oscillating errors in this paper. The differences between external velocity measurements, e.g. GPS or odometer velocity measurements, and INS velocity outputs are applied as control signals to add damping to the system. To find the optimal feedback gains for the control signals, an imaginary system model is developed according to the criterion that the estimation error vector of the states by Kalman filter is identical to the error vector of INS. Thus the elements in the gain matrix of Kalman filter are exactly the optimal gains to be determined. The horizontal velocity damping mechanization is first introduced; followed by the more complex one, i.e. absolute velocity damping mechanization. Simulations are presented in two sections respectively to illustrate the effectiveness of the above two mechanizations. The proposed method breeds a time-variant damping ratio, endowing the system with sound transient and steady-state performance. Finally, the performance of absolute velocity damping algorithm is verified on a dual-axis-rotation strapdown INS with GPS serving as the source of reference velocity.","doi":"10.1109/CGNCC.2016.7829179","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CGNCC.2016.7829179","startPage":"2462","endPage":"2467","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE Chinese Guidance, Navigation and Control Conference (CGNCC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7819651/7828746/07829179.pdf","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE Chinese Guidance, Navigation and Control Conference (CGNCC)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7828746","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Absolute velocity damping algorithm with varying damping ratio for inertial navigation systems based on Kalman filter","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 Aug. 2016","displayDocTitle":"Absolute velocity damping algorithm with varying damping ratio for inertial navigation systems based on Kalman filter","conferenceDate":"12-14 Aug. 2016","publicationDate":"Aug. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"23 January 2017","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7829179/","accessionNumber":"16619120","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7829179/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Absolute velocity damping algorithm with varying damping ratio for inertial navigation systems based on Kalman filter","confLoc":"Nanjing, China","sourcePdf":"0830.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061448S","chronDate":"12-14 Aug. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7819651","isNumber":"7828746","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7819651","xplore-issue":"7828746","articleId":"7829179","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":7829251,"authors":[{"name":"Ying Zhang","affiliation":["HiSilicon Technologies, Shenzhen, China","School of Microelectronics, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/8000711/7829251/zhang-2656466-small.gif","p":["Ying Zhang received the B.Sc. and M.Sc. degrees in microelectronics\n from Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, China, in 2012 and 2016, respectively.","He is currently with HiSilicon Technologies, Shenzhen, China, as an Analog Design Engineer.

On the contrary, a KY converter shows small output voltage ripples and fast transient response compared with the boost converter thanks to its buck-converter-like characteristics. In this study, a comprehensive study of an integrated KY converter considering parasitic resistance is presented as design guidelines for its IC implementation, and various aspects of KY converter versus boost converter are also analyzed to show its advantages. In particular, optimum transistor sizes, power losses, and output voltage ripples are analyzed in depth.

Measurements on 20 samples from one batch show that it achieves an inaccuracy of \u00b160 mK (3\u03c3) from -55 \u00b0C to +125\u00b0C, after a single room-temperature trim. This state-of-the-art result is mainly due to the extensive use of dynamic error cancellation techniques to generate the PNP's collector currents, thus minimizing the spread in their base-emitter voltages, together with a digital PTAT trim to correct for the spread in the PNP's saturation currents. The effect of process variation on the TDC's inaccuracy was investigated by measuring 80 samples from three different batches. Using the same calibration parameters, they exhibit a maximum untrimmed inaccuracy of \u00b12\u00b0C (3\u03c3) from -55\u00b0C to +125\u00b0C. This drops to \u00b1100 mK (3\u03c3) after a single point trim. The proposed TDC thus reduces calibration costs by obviating the need for batch-specific calibration parameters, which would otherwise require the multipoint calibration of several samples.

The proposed multi-dipole antenna with switchable 0\u00b0, +45\u00b0, 90\u00b0 and -45\u00b0 linear polarizations is able to overcome the polarization mismatching and multi-path distortion in complex wireless channels as in BWCS. To realize this reconfigurable feature for the first time among all the reported antenna designs, we assembled four dipoles together with 45\u00b0 rotated sequential arrangements. These dipoles are excited by the same feeding source provided by a ground tapered Balun. A metallic reflector is placed below the dipoles to generate a broadside radiation. By introducing eight PIN diodes as RF switches between the excitation source and the four dipoles, we can control a specific dipole to operate. As the results, 0\u00b0, +45\u00b0, 90\u00b0 and -45\u00b0 linear polarizations can be switched correspondingly to different operating dipoles. Experimental results agree with the simulation and show that the proposed antenna well works in all polarization modes with desirable electrical characteristics. The antenna has a wide impedance bandwidth of 34% from 2.2 to 3.1 GHz (for the reflection coefficient \u2264-10 dB) and exhibits a stable cardioid-shaped radiation pattern across the operating bandwidth with a peak gain of 5.2 dBi. To validate the effectiveness of the multi-dipole antenna for biomedical applications, we also designed a meandered PIFA as the implantable antenna. Finally, the communication link measurement shows that our proposed antenna is able to minimize the polarization mismatching and maintains the optimal communication link thanks to its polarization reconfigurability.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multi-Polarization Reconfigurable Antenna for Wireless Biomedical System","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Circuits and Systems","doi":"10.1109/TBCAS.2016.2636872","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/4156126/7933280/07829256.pdf","startPage":"652","endPage":"660","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TBCAS.2016.2636872","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7933280","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7829256","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7829256/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 May 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2017","displayDocTitle":"Multi-Polarization Reconfigurable Antenna for Wireless Biomedical System","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"11","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/7829256/","dateOfInsertion":"24 May 2017","publicationDate":"June 2017","accessionNumber":"16898990","pubMedId":"28129184","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Research Grants Council of the Hong Kong SAR, China","grantNumber":"CityU138413"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multi-Polarization Reconfigurable Antenna for Wireless Biomedical System","sourcePdf":"tbcas-lin-2636872-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.084902S","chronDate":"June  2017","xplore-pub-id":"4156126","isNumber":"7933280","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4156126","citationCount":"69","xplore-issue":"7933280","articleId":"7829256","onlineDate":"23 May 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-22"},{"_id":7829260,"authors":[{"name":"Haoyu Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering and Information Science, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, China","Key Laboratory of Electromagnetic Space Information, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Hefei, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/22/7963873/7829260/wang-2642945-small.gif","p":["Haoyu Wang was born in Deyang, China, in 1989.

The proposed approach utilizes only 1-bit-resolution analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) in the observation path to digitize the error signal between the input and output signals. The DPD coefficients are then estimated based on the direct learning architecture using the measured signs of the error signal. The proposed solution is proved feasible in theory, and the experimental results show that the proposed algorithm achieves the performance equivalent to that using the conventional method. Replacing high-resolution ADCs with 1-bit comparators in the feedback path can dramatically reduce the power consumption and cost of the DPD system.

Exploring deep CNNs knowledge to ocean front recognition is a challenging task, because the training data is very scarce. This letter overcomes this challenge using a sequence of transfer learning steps via fine-tuning. The core idea is to extract deep knowledge of the CNN model from a large data set and then transfer the knowledge to our ocean front recognition task on limited remote sensing (RS) images. We conducted experiments on two different RS image data sets, with different visual properties, i.e., colorful and gray-level data, which were both downloaded from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). The proposed method was compared with the conventional handcraft descriptor with bag-of-visual-words, original CNN model, and last-layer fine-tuned CNN model. Our method showed a significantly higher accuracy than other methods in both datasets.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Oceans","Feature extraction","Computer architecture","Machine learning","Training data","Neural networks","Data mining"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["geophysical image processing","image recognition","knowledge acquisition","learning (artificial intelligence)","neural nets","oceanographic techniques","remote sensing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["knowledge learning","knowledge transferring","convolutional neural network knowledge","ocean front recognition","deep learning method","fine-tuning","limited remote sensing images","colorful data","gray-level data","NOAA","handcraft descriptor","bag-of-visual-words","last-layer fine-tuned CNN model"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Convolutional neural networks (CNNs)","fine-tuning","ocean front recognition","transfer learning"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7829262","doi":"10.1109/LGRS.2016.2643000","startPage":"354","endPage":"358","publicationTitle":"IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/8859/7862865/07829262.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7862865","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LGRS.2016.2643000","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 January 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7829262/","displayDocTitle":"Learning and Transferring Convolutional Neural Network Knowledge to Ocean Front Recognition","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2017","volume":"14","issue":"3","publicationDate":"March 2017","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"16708626","htmlLink":"/document/7829262/","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"41576011 and 61401413"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100007129","fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of Shandong Province","grantNumber":"ZR2014FQ023"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100007065","fundingName":"NVIDIA Academic Hardware Grant"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Learning and Transferring Convolutional Neural Network Knowledge to Ocean Front Recognition","sourcePdf":"lgrs-lima-2643000-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.131264S","chronDate":"March  2017","xplore-pub-id":"8859","isNumber":"7862865","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8859","citationCount":"27","xplore-issue":"7862865","articleId":"7829262","onlineDate":"23 January 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7829265,"authors":[{"name":"Hui Cui","affiliation":["Secure Mobile Centre, School of Information Systems, Singapore Management University, Singapore"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6687317/8819924/7829265/cui-2656120-small.gif","p":["Hui Cui received the PhD degree from the School of Computing and Information Technology, University of Wollongong, Australia.

However, the standard ABE system does not support secure deduplication, which is crucial for eliminating duplicate copies of identical data in order to save storage space and network bandwidth. In this paper, we present an attribute-based storage system with secure deduplication in a hybrid cloud setting, where a private cloud is responsible for duplicate detection and a public cloud manages the storage. Compared with the prior data deduplication systems, our system has two advantages. First, it can be used to confidentially share data with users by specifying access policies rather than sharing decryption keys. Second, it achieves the standard notion of semantic security for data confidentiality while existing systems only achieve it by defining a weaker security notion. In addition, we put forth a methodology to modify a ciphertext over one access policy into ciphertexts of the same plaintext but under other access policies without revealing the underlying plaintext.","doi":"10.1109/TBDATA.2017.2656120","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Big Data","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Big Data","pdfPath":"/iel7/6687317/8819924/07829265.pdf","startPage":"330","endPage":"342","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TBDATA.2017.2656120","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8819924","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Attribute-Based Storage Supporting Secure Deduplication of Encrypted Data in Cloud","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7829265","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 January 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 1 2019","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7829265/","displayDocTitle":"Attribute-Based Storage Supporting Secure Deduplication of Encrypted Data in Cloud","volume":"5","issue":"3","publicationDate":"1 Sept. 2019","accessionNumber":"18941915","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7829265/","dateOfInsertion":"29 August 2019","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001381","fundingName":"National Research Foundation Singapore","grantNumber":"NRF2014NCR-NCR001-012"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Attribute-Based Storage Supporting Secure Deduplication of Encrypted Data in Cloud","sourcePdf":"tbdata-cui-2656120-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.23784S","chronDate":"Sept. 1 2019","xplore-pub-id":"6687317","isNumber":"8819924","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6687317","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"8819924","articleId":"7829265","onlineDate":"23 January 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-22"},{"_id":7829266,"authors":[{"name":"Saud Althunibat","affiliation":["Communications Engineering Department, Al-Hussein Bin Talal University, Ma\u2019an, Jordan"],"firstName":"Saud","lastName":"Althunibat","orcid":"0000-0002-5017-5007","id":"38519389900"},{"name":"Raed Mesleh","affiliation":["Communications Engineering Department, German Jordanian University, Amman, Jordan"],"firstName":"Raed","lastName":"Mesleh","orcid":"0000-0001-6838-2816","id":"37296995700"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-7798"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2558"},{"format":"CD","value":"2373-7891"}],"articleNumber":"7829266","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":19,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":740},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7829266","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Transmitting antennas","Hamming distance","Phase shift keying","Receiving antennas","Bit error rate"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Multiple input multiple output","spatial modulation","symbol mapping"]}],"abstract":"This letter presents a bit to symbol mapping scheme for spatial modulation multiple input single output systems.

As well, the proposed scheme is shown to be less complex as compared with the transmit antenna selection algorithms.","doi":"10.1109/LCOMM.2017.2656890","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LCOMM.2017.2656890","startPage":"995","endPage":"998","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/4234/7921536/07829266.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7921536","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Bit-to-Symbol Mapping Scheme for Spatial Modulation With Partial Channel State Information","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7829266/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 January 2017","displayDocTitle":"A Bit-to-Symbol Mapping Scheme for Spatial Modulation With Partial Channel State Information","volume":"21","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"08 May 2017","publicationDate":"May 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7829266/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Abdul Hameed Shoman Foundation","grantNumber":"5/2016"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Bit-to-Symbol Mapping Scheme for Spatial Modulation With Partial Channel State Information","sourcePdf":"lcomm-althunibat-2656890-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.06859S","chronDate":"May  2017","xplore-pub-id":"4234","isNumber":"7921536","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4234","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"7921536","articleId":"7829266","onlineDate":"23 January 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Letter","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7829268,"authors":[{"name":"Woo-Sung Jung","affiliation":["NeoReflection, Deajeon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Woo-Sung","lastName":"Jung","orcid":"0000-0003-2755-2721","id":"38186738900"},{"name":"Jinhyuk Yim","affiliation":["Department of Computer Engineering, Ajou University, Suwon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Jinhyuk","lastName":"Yim","id":"37085432997"},{"name":"Young-Bae Ko","affiliation":["Department of Computer Engineering, Ajou University, Suwon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Young-Bae","lastName":"Ko","orcid":"0000-0002-8799-1761","id":"37279008200"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-7798"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2558"},{"format":"CD","value":"2373-7891"}],"articleNumber":"7829268","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":15,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1774},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7829268","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Routing","Routing protocols","Robots","Delays","Mobile nodes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["learning (artificial intelligence)","mobile ad hoc networks","mobile robots","routing protocols"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["network overhead","high-mobility scenarios","machine-learning","route selection","mobile robotic devices","remote control","unmanned robotic networks","geographic ad hoc routing protocol","QGeo"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Geographic routing","machine learning","Q-learning"]}],"abstract":"This letter proposes a novel protocol that uses Q-learning-based geographic routing (QGeo) to improve the network performance of unmanned robotic networks. A rapid and reliable network is essential for the remote control and monitoring of mobile robotic devices. However, controlling the network overhead required for route selection and repair is still a notable challenge, owing to high mobility of the devices. To alleviate this problem, we propose a machine-learning-based geographic routing scheme to reduce network overhead in high-mobility scenarios. We evaluate the performance of QGeo in comparison with other methods using the NS-3 simulator. We find that QGeo has a higher packet delivery ratio and a lower network overhead than existing methods.","doi":"10.1109/LCOMM.2017.2656879","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8063256","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LCOMM.2017.2656879","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications

Smart sensor applications rely on ultralow-power energy harvesters to scavenge energy across a wide range of ambient power levels and charge the battery. Based on the key observation that energy source efficiency is higher than charge pump efficiency, we present a discontinuous harvesting technique that decouples the two efficiencies for a better tradeoff. By slowly accumulating charge on an input capacitor and then transferring it to a battery in burst mode, dc-dc converter switching and leakage losses can be optimally traded off with the loss incurred by nonideal maximum power point tracking operation. Harvester duty cycle is automatically modulated instead of charge pump operating frequency to match with the energy source input power level. The harvester uses a hybrid structure called a moving-sum charge pump for low startup energy upon a mode switch, an automatic conversion ratio modulator based on conduction loss optimization for fast conversion ratio increment, and a <;15-pW asynchronous mode controller for ultralow-power operation. In 180-nm CMOS, the harvester achieves >40% end-to-end efficiency from 113 pW to 1.5 \u03bcW with 20-pW minimum harvestable input power.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel7/4/7888613/07829281.pdf","startPage":"972","endPage":"984","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","doi":"10.1109/JSSC.2016.2645741","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSSC.2016.2645741","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7888613","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7829281","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A 20-pW Discontinuous Switched-Capacitor Energy Harvester for Smart Sensor Applications","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Charge pumps","Switches","Capacitors","Batteries","Maximum power point trackers","Intelligent sensors","Photovoltaic cells"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["charge pump circuits","DC-DC power convertors","energy harvesting","intelligent sensors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["discontinuous switched-capacitor energy harvester","smart sensor","switch capacitor dc-dc converters","ultralow-power energy harvesting","ultralow-power energy harvesters","energy scavenging","charge pump efficiency","discontinuous harvesting technique","nonideal maximum power point tracking operation","moving-sum charge pump","automatic conversion ratio modulator","conduction loss optimization"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["DC\u2013DC converter","discontinuous","energy harvesting","switched capacitor","ultralow power"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7829281/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 January 2017","displayDocTitle":"A 20-pW Discontinuous Switched-Capacitor Energy Harvester for Smart Sensor Applications","volume":"52","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/7829281/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"April 2017","accessionNumber":"16775881","dateOfInsertion":"29 March 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A 20-pW Discontinuous Switched-Capacitor Energy Harvester for Smart Sensor Applications","sourcePdf":"jssc-wu-2645741-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.111125S","chronDate":"April  2017","xplore-pub-id":"4","isNumber":"7888613","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"27","xplore-issue":"7888613","articleId":"7829281","onlineDate":"23 January 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7829285,"authors":[{"name":"Alhassan Khedr","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada"],"firstName":"Alhassan","lastName":"Khedr","orcid":"0000-0003-0372-8489","id":"38006990400"},{"name":"Glenn Gulak","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada"],"firstName":"Glenn","lastName":"Gulak","id":"38556845900"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2168-2194"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2168-2208"}],"articleNumber":"7829285","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":955},"abstract":"Sharing the medical records of individuals among healthcare providers and researchers around the world can accelerate advances in medical research. While the idea seems increasingly practical due to cloud data services, maintaining patient privacy is of paramount importance. Standard encryption algorithms help protect sensitive data from outside attackers but they cannot be used to compute on this sensitive data while being encrypted. Homomorphic Encryption presents a very useful tool that can compute on encrypted data without the need to decrypt it. In this paper, we describe an optimized NTRU-based implementation of the GSW homomorphic encryption scheme. Our results show a factor of 58 \u00d7 improvement in CPU performance compared to other recent work on encrypted medical data under the same security settings. Our system is built to be easily portable to GPUs resulting in an additional speedup of up to a factor of 104 \u00d7 (and 410 \u00d7) to offer an overall speedup of 6085 \u00d7 (and 24011 \u00d7) using a single GPU (or four GPUs), respectively.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics","pdfPath":"/iel7/6221020/8306527/07829285.pdf","startPage":"597","endPage":"606","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics","doi":"10.1109/JBHI.2017.2657458","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JBHI.2017.2657458","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8306527","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7829285","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"SecureMed: Secure Medical Computation Using GPU-Accelerated Homomorphic Encryption Scheme","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Encryption","Medical diagnostic imaging","Cloud computing","Matrix decomposition","Graphics processing units"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","cryptography","data protection","graphics processing units","medical information systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["SecureMed","secure medical computation","healthcare providers","medical research","cloud data services","patient privacy","standard encryption algorithms","GSW homomorphic encryption scheme","security settings","sensitive data protection","medical data encryption","GPU-accelerated homomorphic encryption scheme"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["FHE","GPU","homomorphic encryption","implementation","medical applications","NTRU","relational operations"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Algorithms","Cloud Computing","Computer Communication Networks","Computer Security","Confidentiality","Electronic Health Records","Humans"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7829285/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2018","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 January 2017","displayDocTitle":"SecureMed: Secure Medical Computation Using GPU-Accelerated Homomorphic Encryption Scheme","volume":"22","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/7829285/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 2018","accessionNumber":"17600116","pubMedId":"28129194","dateOfInsertion":"05 March 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000038","fundingName":"Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"SecureMed: Secure Medical Computation Using GPU-Accelerated Homomorphic Encryption Scheme","sourcePdf":"jbhi-khedr-2657458-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.116979S","chronDate":"March  2018","xplore-pub-id":"6221020","isNumber":"8306527","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6221020","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"8306527","articleId":"7829285","onlineDate":"23 January 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7829288,"authors":[{"name":"Abhishek Agrawal","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Oregon State University, Corvallis, OR, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/22/7919344/7829288/agraw-2647723-small.gif","p":["Abhishek Agrawal (S\u201914) received the B.Tech. degree in engineering physics from IIT Madras, Chennai, India, in 2008.

This allows the CMOS VCO to simultaneously achieving wide FTR, area efficiency, and low phase noise, demonstrating state-of-the-art figure of merit (FoM) for > 10-GHz octave-tuning range VCOs. We also analyze the relationship between Q and FTR across common resonator band-switching schemes, quantifying performance limits and highlighting the benefits of using mode-switching for wide-FTR VCOs. The proposed approach is demonstrated through a 6.4-14-GHz (74.6% FTR) VCO implemented in 65-nm CMOS that achieves 186-188-dB VCO FoM, demonstrating good FoM across the entire FTR. The scalability of this approach toward achieving even larger FTR is also demonstrated by a triple-mode 2.2-8.7-GHz (119% FTR) CMOS VCO.

Major contributions are as follows: first, in the absence of external disturbances, a nominal HFC framework is established to achieve exact trajectory tracking control of an ASV, whereby global finite-time stability is ensured by combining homogeneous analysis and Lyapunov approach; second, within the HFC scheme, a finite-time disturbance observer (FDO) is further nested to rapidly and accurately reject complex disturbances, and thereby contributing to an FDO-based HFC (FDO-HFC) scheme, which can realize exactness of trajectory tracking and disturbance observation; and third, aiming to exactly deal with complicated unknowns including unmodeled dynamics and/or disturbances, a finite-time unknown observer (FUO) is deployed as a patch for the nominal HFC framework, and eventually results in an FUO-based HFC (FUO-HFC) scheme, which guarantees that accurate trajectory tracking can be achieved for an ASV under harsh environments. Simulation studies and comprehensive comparisons conducted on a benchmark ship demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed HFC schemes.","doi":"10.1109/TIV.2017.2657379","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Vehicles","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Vehicles","pdfPath":"/iel7/7274857/7879184/07829290.pdf","startPage":"230","endPage":"243","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIV.2017.2657379","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7879184","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fast and Accurate Trajectory Tracking Control of an Autonomous Surface Vehicle With Unmodeled Dynamics and Disturbances","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7829290","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  2016","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7829290/","displayDocTitle":"Fast and Accurate Trajectory Tracking Control of an Autonomous Surface Vehicle With Unmodeled Dynamics and Disturbances","volume":"1","issue":"3","publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","accessionNumber":"16759977","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7829290/","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"51009017 and 51379002"},{"fundingName":"Fund for Dalian Distinguished Young Scholars","grantNumber":"2016RJ10"},{"fundingName":"Innovation Support Plan for Dalian High-Level Talents","grantNumber":"2015R065"},{"fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities","grantNumber":"3132016314"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fast and Accurate Trajectory Tracking Control of an Autonomous Surface Vehicle With Unmodeled Dynamics and Disturbances","sourcePdf":"tiv-wang-2657379-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.116381S","chronDate":"Sept.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"7274857","isNumber":"7879184","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7274857","citationCount":"63","xplore-issue":"7879184","articleId":"7829290","onlineDate":"23 January 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7829291,"authors":[{"name":"Haodong Li","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Information Technology","Guangdong Key Laboratory of Information Security Technology, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/10206/7862329/7829291/li-2656823-small.gif","p":["Haodong Li received the B.S. degree from Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China, in 2012, where he is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree with the School of Electronics and Information Technology.

Although it is able to detect tampered images at high accuracies based on some carefully designed mechanisms, localization of the tampered regions in a fake image still presents many challenges, especially when the type of tampering operation is unknown. Some researchers have realized that it is necessary to integrate different forensic approaches in order to obtain better localization performance. However, several important issues have not been comprehensively studied, for example, how to select and improve/readjust proper forensic approaches, and how to fuse the detection results of different forensic approaches to obtain good localization results. In this paper, we propose a framework to improve the performance of forgery localization via integrating tampering possibility maps. In the proposed framework, we first select and improve two existing forensic approaches, i.e., statistical feature-based detector and copy-move forgery detector, and then adjust their results to obtain tampering possibility maps. After investigating the properties of possibility maps and comparing various fusion schemes, we finally propose a simple yet very effective strategy to integrate the tampering possibility maps to obtain the final localization results. The extensive experiments show that the two improved approaches used in our framework significantly outperform the state-of-the-art techniques, and the proposed fusion results achieve the best F\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1</sub>\n-score in the IEEE IFS-TC Image Forensics Challenge.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7862329","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIFS.2017.2656823","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security","pdfPath":"/iel7/10206/7862329/07829291.pdf","startPage":"1240","endPage":"1252","doi":"10.1109/TIFS.2017.2656823","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Image Forgery Localization via Integrating Tampering Possibility Maps","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2017","displayDocTitle":"Image Forgery Localization via Integrating Tampering Possibility Maps","volume":"12","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/7829291/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May 2017","accessionNumber":"16690588","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7829291/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 January 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61672551, 61272191 and U1636202"},{"fundingName":"Shenzhen R&D Program","grantNumber":"JCYJ20160328144421330"},{"fundingName":"Fok Ying-Tong Education Foundation","grantNumber":"142003"},{"fundingName":"Special Research Plan of Guangdong Province","grantNumber":"2015TQ01X365"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Image Forgery Localization via Integrating Tampering Possibility Maps","sourcePdf":"tifs-luo-2656823-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.103969S","chronDate":"May  2017","xplore-pub-id":"10206","isNumber":"7862329","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10206","citationCount":"42","xplore-issue":"7862329","articleId":"7829291","onlineDate":"23 January 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-31"},{"_id":7829292,"authors":[{"name":"Xizhen Peng","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Specialty Fiber Optics and Optical Access Networks, Shanghai University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Xizhen","lastName":"Peng","id":"37086085657"},{"name":"Jian Chen","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Specialty Fiber Optics and Optical Access Networks, Shanghai University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Jian","lastName":"Chen","id":"37085872071"},{"name":"Yingchun Li","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Specialty Fiber Optics and Optical Access Networks, Shanghai University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Yingchun","lastName":"Li","id":"37538194400"},{"name":"Yingxiong Song","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Specialty Fiber Optics and Optical Access Networks, Shanghai University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Yingxiong","lastName":"Song","id":"37281076500"}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1943-0655"},{"format":"CD","value":"1943-0647"}],"articleNumber":"7829292","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":592},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Photonics Society","url":"http://www.PhotonicsSociety.org"}],"graphicalAbstract":{"summary":"Real-time experimental setup for OFDMA-PON.

These methods compute the time-frequency (TF) distribution of the stator current, where the patterns of the related fault components can be detected. A significant amount of recent proposals in this field have focused on improving the resolution of the TF distributions, allowing a better discrimination and identification of fault harmonic components. Nevertheless, as the resolution improves, computational requirements (power computing and memory) greatly increase, restricting its implementation in low-cost devices for performing on-line fault diagnosis. To address these drawbacks, in this paper, the use of the short-frequency Fourier transform (SFFT) for fault diagnosis of induction machines working under transient regimes is proposed. The SFFT not only keeps the resolution of traditional techniques, such as the short-time Fourier transform, but also achieves a drastic reduction of computing time and memory resources, making this proposal suitable for on-line fault diagnosis. This method is theoretically introduced and experimentally validated using a laboratory test bench.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Short-Frequency Fourier Transform for Fault Diagnosis of Induction Machines Working in Transient Regime","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement","doi":"10.1109/TIM.2016.2647458","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement","pdfPath":"/iel7/19/7847459/07829309.pdf","startPage":"432","endPage":"440","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIM.2016.2647458","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7847459","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7829309","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7829309/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 January 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2017","displayDocTitle":"Short-Frequency Fourier Transform for Fault Diagnosis of Induction Machines Working in Transient Regime","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"66","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/7829309/","dateOfInsertion":"08 February 2017","publicationDate":"March 2017","accessionNumber":"16652135","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003329","fundingName":"Spanish Ministerio de Econom\u00eda y Competitividad in the framework of the Programa Estatal de Investigaci\u00f3n, Desarrollo e Innovaci\u00f3n Orientada a los Retos de la Sociedad","grantNumber":"DPI2014-60881-R"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Short-Frequency Fourier Transform for Fault Diagnosis of Induction Machines Working in Transient Regime","sourcePdf":"tim-pinedasanchez-2647458-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.098045S","chronDate":"March  2017","xplore-pub-id":"19","isNumber":"7847459","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"19","citationCount":"44","xplore-issue":"7847459","articleId":"7829309","onlineDate":"23 January 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7829314,"authors":[{"name":"Boon-Eu Seow","affiliation":["Institute of Computer and Communication Engineering, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/22/7919344/7829314/seow-2647943-small.gif","p":["Boon-Eu Seow was born in George Town, Penang, Malaysia.

CNNs require large amounts of processing capacity and memory, which can exceed the resources of low power mobile and embedded systems. Several designs for hardware accelerators have been proposed for CNNs which typically contain large numbers of Multiply Accumulate (MAC) units. One approach to reducing data sizes and memory traffic in CNN accelerators is \u201cweight sharing\u201d, where the full range of values in a trained CNN are put in bins and the bin index is stored instead of the original weight value. In this paper we propose a novel MAC circuit that exploits binning in weight-sharing CNNs. Rather than computing the MAC directly we instead count the frequency of each weight and place it in a bin. We then compute the accumulated value in a subsequent multiply phase. This allows hardware multipliers in the MAC circuit to be replaced with adders and selection logic. Experiments show that for the same clock speed our approach results in fewer gates, smaller logic, and reduced power.","doi":"10.1109/LCA.2017.2656880","publicationTitle":"IEEE Computer Architecture Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Computer Architecture Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/10208/8240814/07829315.pdf","startPage":"132","endPage":"135","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LCA.2017.2656880","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8240814","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7829315","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Low Complexity Multiply Accumulate Unit for Weight-Sharing Convolutional Neural Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"July-Dec. 1 2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 January 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7829315/","displayDocTitle":"Low Complexity Multiply Accumulate Unit for Weight-Sharing Convolutional Neural Networks","volume":"16","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/7829315/","publicationDate":"1 July-Dec. 2017","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"27 December 2017","accessionNumber":"17468493","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001602","fundingName":"Science Foundation Ireland","grantNumber":"12/IA/1381"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low Complexity Multiply Accumulate Unit for Weight-Sharing Convolutional Neural Networks","sourcePdf":"lca-garland-2656880-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.085056S","chronDate":"July-Dec. 1 2017","xplore-pub-id":"10208","isNumber":"8240814","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10208","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"8240814","articleId":"7829315","onlineDate":"23 January 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7829316,"authors":[{"name":"Mohammadhassan Akbarpour","affiliation":["Intelligent RF Radio Laboratory, Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Calgary, Calgary, AB, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/22/7891659/7829316/akbar-2645149-small.gif","p":["Mohammadhassan Akbarpour (S\u201910\u2013M\u201916) received the M.Sc. degree in microwave and optics engineering from the Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Iran, in 2006, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from the University of Calgary, Calgary, AB, Canada, in 2015.","He is currently with EMSCAN Corporation, Calgary.

In the proposed biasing scheme, a constant current source is used as the power supply for the transistor's output terminal. A whole new family of amplifier classes can be defined using this biasing scheme. Analytical equations are obtained and verified for current and voltage waveforms of a current-biased transistor for both resistive and tuned load impedances. Using the proposed current biasing scheme, the transistor presents completely different behaviors compared with the conventional voltage biasing scheme. These properties can be utilized for new design concepts and can provide new possibilities in the future designs and applications. Some of the differences between current-biased and voltage-biased amplifiers are discussed. One of the different behaviors shown by the current-biased transistor amplifiers is the reversed load modulation. Using this property of the current-biased amplifiers, a reversed modulation dual branch (RMDB) amplifier structure is proposed for ultra-wideband high efficiency at power back-off. Due to the reversed load modulation of current-biased transistors, a multibranch amplifier can be implemented to obtain high efficiency at power back-off without the need for an impedance inverter at the output of the current-biased amplifier. By using the proposed amplifier structure, a wideband RMDB amplifier was fabricated and tested exhibiting higher than 37% efficiency for long-term evolution (LTE) signals in 0.8-2.2-GHz bandwidth, which is equivalent to 93% fractional bandwidth.","doi":"10.1109/TMTT.2016.2645149","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMTT.2016.2645149","startPage":"1257","endPage":"1271","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel7/22/7891659/07829316.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7891659","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Current-Biasing of Power-Amplifier Transistors and Its Application for Ultra-Wideband High Efficiency at Power Back-Off","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 January 2017","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2017","displayDocTitle":"Current-Biasing of Power-Amplifier Transistors and Its Application for Ultra-Wideband High Efficiency at Power Back-Off","publicationDate":"April 2017","dateOfInsertion":"03 April 2017","volume":"65","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7829316/","accessionNumber":"16806960","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7829316/","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000146","fundingName":"Alberta Innovates - Technology Futures"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000038","fundingName":"National Science and Engineering Research Council of Canada"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001804","fundingName":"Canada Research Chairs Program"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Current-Biasing of Power-Amplifier Transistors and Its Application for Ultra-Wideband High Efficiency at Power Back-Off","sourcePdf":"tmtt-akbarpour-2645149-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.096646S","chronDate":"April  2017","xplore-pub-id":"22","isNumber":"7891659","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"7891659","articleId":"7829316","onlineDate":"23 January 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":7829319,"authors":[{"name":"Sideng Hu","affiliation":["College of Electrical Engineering, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/7955109/7829319/hu-2656253-small.gif","p":["Sideng Hu (M'14) was born in China, in 1984.

But the load deviation reflected from secondary side to primary side will result in the frequency mismatch issue. Therefore, the contactless load detection technique is significant to ensure the power transfer efficiency and capacity. The emerging technique taking advantages of the amplitude decay rate in a transient process is promising. The robustness and practicability can get enhanced and the complicated steady circuit model is avoided. However, the accuracy for the small resistance application is still a challenge even with sophisticated compensation algorithms. This paper classified the system detectable region through the root locus method. The transient process in different subregions is excavated mathematically. It is revealed that the variation of the system from the second order to fourth order is the key issue for the detection error in the small load resistance application. The analysis brings out a novel automatic contactless load detection method to extend the detection range. Both simulation and experimental results verified the effectiveness of the proposed theory and detection method.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7829319/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 January 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7829319/","dateOfInsertion":"22 June 2017","publicationDate":"Nov. 2017","accessionNumber":"16969390","volume":"32","issue":"11","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Principle and Application of the Contactless Load Detection Based on the Amplitude Decay Rate in a Transient Process","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"51407159 and 51507152"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Principle and Application of the Contactless Load Detection Based on the Amplitude Decay Rate in a Transient Process","sourcePdf":"tpel-hu-2656253-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.073282S","chronDate":"Nov.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"7955109","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"7955109","articleId":"7829319","onlineDate":"23 January 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":7829326,"authors":[{"name":"David M.

We observe that large amplitude fluctuations occur more frequently immediately after programming and their frequency of occurrence decays in the tens of microseconds. The fluctuation amplitude, on the other hand, does not decay noticeably over the entire millisecond read time. While post-programming instability and post-programming resistance dispersion have both been reported in the literature, the relaxation in the frequency of occurrence without a commensurate amplitude decay is new. Since picosecond pulses were used for our RESET operation, post-programming thermalization occurs on the nanosecond time scale. This clearly eliminates a thermally driven mechanism as the cause of the observed fluctuation behavior. Furthermore, reducing the READ voltage by tenfold does not have any effect and also eliminates read disturb as possible cause.","doi":"10.1109/LED.2017.2656818","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Electron Device Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/55/7862302/07829326.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LED.2017.2656818","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7862302","publicationTitle":"IEEE Electron Device Letters","startPage":"326","endPage":"329","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 January 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Characteristics of Resistive Memory Read Fluctuations in Endurance Cycling","volume":"38","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/7829326/","dateOfInsertion":"22 February 2017","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"16690986","publicationDate":"March 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7829326/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2017","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100007769","fundingName":"Physical Measurement Laboratory","grantNumber":"70NANB16H175"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Characteristics of Resistive Memory Read Fluctuations in Endurance Cycling","sourcePdf":"led-nminibapiel-2656818-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.079318S","chronDate":"March  2017","xplore-pub-id":"55","isNumber":"7862302","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"55","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"7862302","articleId":"7829326","onlineDate":"23 January 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Letter","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7829329,"authors":[{"name":"Brock B\u00f6se","affiliation":["Northrop Grumman Corporation, Falls Church, VA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4267003/7959216/7829329/bose-2558507-small.gif","p":["Brock\u00a0B\u00f6se received Ph.D. degree in plasma physics from the\n Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, USA, in 2010.","He then joined Northrop Grumman Corporation, Falls Church, VA, USA, as a Future Technology Leader, where he is\n currently a Data Scientist with the ISR Division.

In this paper, important design and implementation aspects of polymer-jetting-based 3-D-printed EM components are discussed. A number of 3-D-printable polymer materials and their broadband EM characterization from GHz to THz are introduced. Design methodologies specific for 3-D-printed antennas and other EM components are presented. As examples, various 3-D-printed devices operating from GHz to THz frequency, including electromagnetic crystals (EMXT), waveguide, horn antenna, gradient index (GRIN) lenses, as well as 3-D AM-enabled new designs, such as millimeter wave (mmW)/THz, reflect array antennas, computer-generated THz holograms, and so on are reviewed. Moreover, current limitations and possible future improvements of the polymer jetting technique for EM applications are discussed.

We also apply Gauss-Hermite quadrature formula to obtain the closed-form solution for the system BER in the case of lognormal underwater fading channel.

Each source node transmits user and jamming signals with distinct precoding vectors. Based on the assumption that the channel state information relating to the eavesdropper is unknown by the legitimate nodes, new precoding design algorithms are proposed. The jamming signals are designed to ensure that minimum interference is perceived by the other source node. The precoding vectors of the user signals are designed to form two parallel vectors in the equivalent wiretap channel at the eavesdropper. Two algorithms are proposed based upon the zero-forcing and matched-filter schemes, which are dubbed the selective zero-forcing-based precoding (SZFP) and matched-filter-based precoding schemes. Analytical and simulation results are presented to demonstrate that the SZFP algorithm is more applicable when the eavesdropper is equipped with a large number of antennas or the eavesdropper's channels are in good condition.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security","pdfPath":"/iel7/10206/7867904/07829339.pdf","startPage":"1309","endPage":"1318","doi":"10.1109/TIFS.2017.2656846","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIFS.2017.2656846","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7867904","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Precoding and Cooperative Jamming in Multi- Antenna Two-Way Relaying Wiretap Systems Without Eavesdropper\u2019s Channel State Information","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7829339/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 January 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2017","displayDocTitle":"Precoding and Cooperative Jamming in Multi- Antenna Two-Way Relaying Wiretap Systems Without Eavesdropper\u2019s Channel State Information","htmlLink":"/document/7829339/","publicationDate":"June 2017","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","accessionNumber":"16707450","isJournal":true,"volume":"12","issue":"6","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"NSFC","grantNumber":"61302088"},{"fundingName":"Research Fund for the Doctoral Program of Higher Education","grantNumber":"20130005120003"},{"fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities under","grantNumber":"2014ZD03-03"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Precoding and Cooperative Jamming in Multi- Antenna Two-Way Relaying Wiretap Systems Without Eavesdropper\u2019s Channel State Information","sourcePdf":"tifs-long-2656846-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.112502S","chronDate":"June  2017","xplore-pub-id":"10206","isNumber":"7867904","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10206","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"7867904","articleId":"7829339","onlineDate":"23 January 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":7829341,"authors":[{"name":"Justin Salamon","affiliation":["Music and Audio Research Laboratory and the Center for Urban Science and Progress, New York University, New York, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Justin","lastName":"Salamon","id":"38233552700"},{"name":"Juan Pablo Bello","affiliation":["Music and Audio Research Laboratory and the Center for Urban Science and Progress, New York University, New York, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Juan Pablo","lastName":"Bello","id":"37265737000"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1070-9908"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2361"}],"articleNumber":"7829341","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":519,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":14194},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.signalprocessingsociety.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Convolution","Training","Neural networks","Data models","Shape","Training data","Time-frequency analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["audio signal processing","neural nets","signal classification"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["deep convolutional neural networks","audio data augmentation","environmental sound classification","discriminative spectro-temporal patterns","high-capacity models","augmented training set","class-conditional data augmentation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs)","deep learning","environmental sound classification","urban sound dataset"]}],"abstract":"The ability of deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to learn discriminative spectro-temporal patterns makes them well suited to environmental sound classification. However, the relative scarcity of labeled data has impeded the exploitation of this family of high-capacity models. This study has two primary contributions: first, we propose a deep CNN architecture for environmental sound classification. Second, we propose the use of audio data augmentation for overcoming the problem of data scarcity and explore the influence of different augmentations on the performance of the proposed CNN architecture. Combined with data augmentation, the proposed model produces state-of-the-art results for environmental sound classification. We show that the improved performance stems from the combination of a deep, high-capacity model and an augmented training set: this combination outperforms both the proposed CNN without augmentation and a \u201cshallow\u201d dictionary learning model with augmentation. Finally, we examine the influence of each augmentation on the model's classification accuracy for each class, and observe that the accuracy for each class is influenced differently by each augmentation, suggesting that the performance of the model could be improved further by applying class-conditional data augmentation.","doi":"10.1109/LSP.2017.2657381","publicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/97/7837777/07829341.pdf","startPage":"279","endPage":"283","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7837777","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LSP.2017.2657381","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Deep Convolutional Neural Networks and Data Augmentation for Environmental Sound Classification","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7829341","chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/97/7837777/7829341-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2017","displayDocTitle":"Deep Convolutional Neural Networks and Data Augmentation for Environmental Sound Classification","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7829341/","publicationDate":"March 2017","dateOfInsertion":"08 February 2017","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"16649593","htmlLink":"/document/7829341/","volume":"24","issue":"3","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 January 2017","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"NSF","grantNumber":"1544753"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","chorusFlag":"true","title":"Deep Convolutional Neural Networks and Data Augmentation for Environmental Sound Classification","sourcePdf":"lsp-salamon-2657381-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.103629S","chronDate":"March  2017","xplore-pub-id":"97","isNumber":"7837777","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"97","citationCount":"519","xplore-issue":"7837777","articleId":"7829341","onlineDate":"23 January 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":7829354,"authors":[{"name":"Wenhui Cao","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University College Dublin, Dublin 4, Ireland"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/22/7963873/7829354/cao-2640318-small.gif","p":["Wenhui Cao (S\u201915) received the B.E. degree in automation from the Beijing University of Chemical Technology, Beijing, China, in 2013.

In this paper, a detailed parametric study by varying the dimensions of fin and perforation is carried out to obtain a physical insight into the enhanced heat transfer characteristics of a perforated fin. The perforated fins are found to have an augmented heat transfer rate compared to the solid fins having same contact area. This paper uses a computationally efficient algorithm using soft computing to determine the optimized geometry with a limited set of numerical solutions. This is achieved with the help of artificial neural network (ANN). To reduce the effort in determining suitable parameters for ANN, genetic algorithm (GA) is used. The ANN is trained based on a minimal set of numerical/computational fluid dynamics (CFD) results. The trained ANN can then predict the base plate temperature for any other untrained set of parameters in the same range. A multiobjective optimization of the perforated fin is carried out with two objectives: minimum base plate temperature and maximum weight reduction. This is carried out by applying the GA on the ANN as the fitness function to obtain the multiobjective optimal. The obtained optimized fin geometry can thus be used effectively in many heat transfer applications that necessitate heat transfer enhancement with reduced weight compared to the conventional fins.","doi":"10.1109/TCPMT.2016.2646718","startPage":"208","endPage":"216","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Components, Packaging and Manufacturing Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/5503870/7843693/07829361.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Components, Packaging and Manufacturing Technology","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCPMT.2016.2646718","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7843693","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Computational Heat Transfer Analysis and Genetic Algorithm\u2013Artificial Neural Network\u2013Genetic Algorithm-Based Multiobjective Optimization of Rectangular Perforated Plate Fins","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Heat transfer","Optimization","Heating","Mathematical model","Geometry","Genetic algorithms","Numerical models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["aluminium","computational fluid dynamics","genetic algorithms","heat transfer","neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["rectangular perforated plate fins","computational heat transfer analysis","genetic algorithm","artificial neural network","multiobjective optimization","longitudinal rectangular perforations","aluminum base plate","laminar natural convection conditions","augmented heat transfer rate","soft computing","computational fluid dynamics","base plate temperature","fitness function","fin geometry","Al"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Genetic algorithm\u2013artificial neural network\u2013genetic algorithm (GA-ANN-GA)","heat transfer","optimization","perforated fins"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7829361/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 January 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2017","displayDocTitle":"Computational Heat Transfer Analysis and Genetic Algorithm\u2013Artificial Neural Network\u2013Genetic Algorithm-Based Multiobjective Optimization of Rectangular Perforated Plate Fins","volume":"7","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/7829361/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"06 February 2017","accessionNumber":"16652215","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Computational Heat Transfer Analysis and Genetic Algorithm\u2013Artificial Neural Network\u2013Genetic Algorithm-Based Multiobjective Optimization of Rectangular Perforated Plate Fins","sourcePdf":"tcpmt-muniyandi-2646718-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.085993S","chronDate":"Feb.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"5503870","isNumber":"7843693","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5503870","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7843693","articleId":"7829361","onlineDate":"23 January 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":7829364,"authors":[{"name":"Zaifeng Yang","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/22/7870723/7829364/yang-2645148-small.gif","p":["Zaifeng Yang (S\u201912) received the B.Eng. and M.Eng. degrees from the School of Communication and Information Engineering, Shanghai University, Shanghai, China.

The proposed methods are unconditionally stable and capable of treating multiple main transmission lines and stubs interconnected at various interjunctions using time step larger than Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy limit. Fundamental scheme-based IM1-D FADI- and FLOD-FDTD methods are derived to enhance the efficiency with matrix-operator-free right-hand sides. The methods involve one-step update procedure optimized for simulation of main transmission lines and stubs on mobile device. Using proper treatments at the interjunctions for various interconnection conditions, the electromagnetic fields in all interconnected main transmission lines and stubs can be updated cooperatively and efficiently to solve practical problems. A microstrip line loaded with stubs and a branch-line coupler are simulated to show the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed methods. To extend the applicability for handling the couplings between two transmission lines via gaps, a microstrip circuit with gaps is simulated using the proposed methods incorporated with equivalent circuit models involving capacitances. Real-time simulations of these numerical examples provide much intuitional insight for one to observe the electromagnetic waves propagation in time domain on computer or mobile device.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel7/22/7870723/07829364.pdf","startPage":"684","endPage":"692","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","doi":"10.1109/TMTT.2016.2645148","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMTT.2016.2645148","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7870723","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7829364","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Interconnected Multi-1-D FADI- and FLOD-FDTD Methods for Transmission Lines With Interjunctions","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power transmission lines","Integrated circuit interconnections","Finite difference methods","Time-domain analysis","Mobile handsets","Transmission line matrix methods","Integrated circuit modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["directional couplers","equivalent circuits","finite difference time-domain analysis","microstrip circuits","microstrip lines","transmission line theory","transmission lines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["interconnected multi1D FADI-methods","FLOD-FDTD methods","interconnected multione dimensional fundamental alternating-direction-implicit finite-difference time-domain method","fundamental locally 1D finite-difference time-domain methods","interjunctions","multiple main transmission lines","stubs","matrix-operator-free right-hand sides","one-step update procedure","mobile device","electromagnetic fields","interconnection conditions","microstrip line","branch-line coupler","microstrip circuit","equivalent circuit models","real-time simulations","electromagnetic waves propagation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Electromagnetic waves\u2019 propagation","fundamental alternating-direction-implicit finite-difference time-domain (FADI-FDTD)","fundamental locally 1-D finite-difference time-domain (FLOD-FDTD)","fundamental schemes","mobile device","time-domain simulation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7829364/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 January 2017","displayDocTitle":"Interconnected Multi-1-D FADI- and FLOD-FDTD Methods for Transmission Lines With Interjunctions","volume":"65","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/7829364/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 2017","accessionNumber":"16721499","dateOfInsertion":"03 March 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"research projects","grantNumber":"DSOCL12016 and MOE TRF 2015-1-TR15"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Interconnected Multi-1-D FADI- and FLOD-FDTD Methods for Transmission Lines With Interjunctions","sourcePdf":"tmtt-yang-2645148-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.13261S","chronDate":"March  2017","xplore-pub-id":"22","isNumber":"7870723","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"7870723","articleId":"7829364","onlineDate":"23 January 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7829367,"authors":[{"name":"Mahbub Alam","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7298/7872491/7829367/alam-2656839-small.gif","p":["Md Mahbub Alam (S\u201916) received the B.S. degree in electrical and electrical engineering from the Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology in 2011.

Although it is a nondestructive process, electrical functionalities of IC under long time radiation has yet to be fully investigated. This paper analyzes the impact of X-ray tomography on the reliability of ICs with different fabrication technologies. We perform a 3-D imaging on Intel flash memories, Macronix flash memories, Xilinx Spartan 3, and Spartan 6 FPGAs and test the electrical functionalities after each round of tomography. We examine the impact of tomography on erase time, read margin, and program operation in flash memories. The change of ring oscillators frequency mapped in FPGAs is also investigated. A major finding is that tomography increases the erase time of flash memory of older technology nodes, eventually resulting in failure. In contrast, the flash and Xilinx FPGAs of newer technologies seem much less sensitive to tomography, as only minor degradations are observed. Degradation of IC performance is explained by considering total ionization dose effect due to tomography. Counterfeit detection requires approximately 2 h of tomography and no IC failed permanently during this time period.","doi":"10.1109/TDMR.2017.2656839","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7872491","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TDMR.2017.2656839","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Device and Materials Reliability","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Device and Materials Reliability","pdfPath":"/iel7/7298/7872491/07829367.pdf","startPage":"59","endPage":"68","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Impact of X-Ray Tomography on the Reliability of Integrated Circuits","chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/7298/7872491/7829367-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 January 2017","displayDocTitle":"Impact of X-Ray Tomography on the Reliability of Integrated Circuits","volume":"17","issue":"1","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2017","dateOfInsertion":"06 March 2017","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7829367/","publicationDate":"March 2017","accessionNumber":"16725041","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7829367/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"CCF-1423282 and CNS-1558516"},{"fundingName":"AFOSR MURI","grantNumber":"FA9550-14-1-0351"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","chorusFlag":"true","title":"Impact of X-Ray Tomography on the Reliability of Integrated Circuits","sourcePdf":"tdmr-alam-2656839-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.098053S","chronDate":"March  2017","xplore-pub-id":"7298","isNumber":"7872491","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7298","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"7872491","articleId":"7829367","onlineDate":"23 January 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7829368,"authors":[{"name":"Kazi Masudul Alam","affiliation":["Multimedia Computing Research Laboratory, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, ON, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/7859429/7829368/alam-2657006-small.gif","p":["Kazi Masudul Alam has received the B.Eng. degree from Khulna University, Bangladesh, and the M.C.S. degree from the University of Ottawa, Canada, in 2012, where he is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree in electrical and computer engineering.

Contemporary researchers recommend integrating cloud technologies in the CPS cyber layer to ensure the scalability of storage, computation, and cross domain communication capabilities. Though there exist a few descriptive models of the cloud-based CPS architecture, it is important to analytically describe the key CPS properties: computation, control, and communication. In this paper, we present a digital twin architecture reference model for the cloud-based CPS, C2PS, where we analytically describe the key properties of the C2PS. The model helps in identifying various degrees of basic and hybrid computation-interaction modes in this paradigm. We have designed C2PS smart interaction controller using a Bayesian belief network, so that the system dynamically considers current contexts. The composition of fuzzy rule base with the Bayes network further enables the system with reconfiguration capability. We also describe analytically, how C2PS subsystem communications can generate even more complex system-of-systems. Later, we present a telematics-based prototype driving assistance application for the vehicular domain of C2PS, VCPS, to demonstrate the efficacy of the architecture reference model.","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2657006","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2657006","startPage":"2050","endPage":"2062","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/7859429/07829368.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7859429","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"C2PS: A Digital Twin Architecture Reference Model for the Cloud-Based Cyber-Physical Systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7829368/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 January 2017","displayDocTitle":"C2PS: A Digital Twin Architecture Reference Model for the Cloud-Based Cyber-Physical Systems","volume":"5","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"09 March 2017","accessionNumber":"16720312","isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"2017","htmlLink":"/document/7829368/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"T","title":"C2PS: A Digital Twin Architecture Reference Model for the Cloud-Based Cyber-Physical Systems","sourcePdf":"access-alam-2657006-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.114809S","chronDate":"2017","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"7859429","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"240","xplore-issue":"7859429","articleId":"7829368","onlineDate":"23 January 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-23"},{"_id":7829370,"authors":[{"name":"Hang Chang","affiliation":["Berkeley Biomedical Data Science Center, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Berkeley, CA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/34/8329157/7829370/chang-2656884-small.gif","p":["Hang Chang received the PhD degree from the Institute of Automation,\n Chinese Academy of Sciences, in 2008.

They are evolving into cyber-physical systems (CPS) with sophisticated interactions between physical and computational processes, making them vulnerable to cyber attacks. This paper presents a framework to detect possible false-data injection attacks (FDIAs) in cyber-physical dc microgrids. The detection problem is formalized as identifying a change in sets of inferred candidate invariants. Invariants are microgrids properties that do not change over time. Both the physical plant and the software controller of CPS can be described as Simulink/Stateflow (SLSF) diagrams. The dynamic analysis infers the candidate invariants over the input/output variables of SLSF components. The reachability analysis generates the sets of reachable states (reach sets) for the CPS modeled as hybrid automata. The candidate invariants that contain the reach sets are called the actual invariants. The candidate invariants are then compared with the actual invariants, and any mismatch indicates the presence of FDIA. To evaluate the proposed methodology, the hybrid automaton of a dc microgrid, with a distributed cooperative control scheme, is presented. The reachability analysis is performed to obtain the reach sets and, hence, the actual invariants. Moreover, a prototype tool, HYbrid iNvariant GEneratoR, is extended to instrument SLSF models, obtain candidate invariants, and identify FDIA.","doi":"10.1109/TII.2017.2656905","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics","pdfPath":"/iel7/9424/8059716/07829372.pdf","startPage":"2693","endPage":"2703","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8059716","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TII.2017.2656905","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Detection of False-Data Injection Attacks in Cyber-Physical DC Microgrids","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7829372","chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/9424/8059716/7829372-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2017","displayDocTitle":"Detection of False-Data Injection Attacks in Cyber-Physical DC Microgrids","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7829372/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"05 October 2017","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"17240826","htmlLink":"/document/7829372/","volume":"13","issue":"5","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 January 2017","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"ECCS-1405173, CNS 1464311 and SHF 1527398"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100006602","fundingName":"Air Force Research Laboratory","grantNumber":"FA8750-15-1-0105"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000181","fundingName":"Air Force Office of Scientific Research","grantNumber":"FA9550-15-1-0258 and FA9550-16-1-0246"},{"fundingName":"US Office of the Naval Research","grantNumber":"N00014-14-1-0718"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","chorusFlag":"true","title":"Detection of False-Data Injection Attacks in Cyber-Physical DC Microgrids","sourcePdf":"tii-davoudi-2656905-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.134464S","chronDate":"Oct.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"9424","isNumber":"8059716","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9424","citationCount":"69","xplore-issue":"8059716","articleId":"7829372","onlineDate":"23 January 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"Traditional","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7829385,"authors":[{"name":"Junaid Imtiaz","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Bahria University, Islamabad, Pakistan","Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, Hanyang University, ERICA, Ansan, South Korea"],"firstName":"Junaid","lastName":"Imtiaz","orcid":"0000-0003-0625-3810","id":"37967226800"},{"name":"Dongwoo Kim","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, Hanyang University, ERICA, Ansan, South Korea"],"firstName":"Dongwoo","lastName":"Kim","orcid":"0000-0001-5541-5738","id":"37086007862"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-7798"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2558"},{"format":"CD","value":"2373-7891"}],"articleNumber":"7829385","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":423},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7829385","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Throughput","Sensors","Energy consumption","Cognitive radio","Diversity methods","Probability density function","Signal to noise ratio"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cogntive radio system","energy efficiency","throughput"]}],"abstract":"In cooperative cognitive radio systems (CRSs), where battery-powered cognitive radio terminals (CTs) frequently sense and report primary user\u2019s (PU\u2019s) existence to exploit a spectrum hole, \n<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">energy efficiency</i>\n (EE) is a challenging design issue. To improve EE in CRSs, letting only some of the CTs be active in sensing and reporting [called a quality-based activation (QBA)] is proposed in this letter. With QBA, CTs that have good channel quality in a data channel (DCH) as well as a reporting channel (RCH) are allowed to sense and report. A possible drawback of such conditional activation is that it could limit the participation of CTs in a scheduling procedure, and hence, may result in losing certain system throughput. Throughput and EE of CRSs with the proposed QBA are investigated and it is shown, with numerical examples, that QBA does not decrease the throughput and provides significant improvement in EE.","doi":"10.1109/LCOMM.2017.2656910","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7921536","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LCOMM.2017.2656910","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/4234/7921536/07829385.pdf","startPage":"1171","endPage":"1174","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Energy-Efficient Management of Cognitive Radio Terminals With Quality-Based Activation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 January 2017","displayDocTitle":"Energy-Efficient Management of Cognitive Radio Terminals With Quality-Based Activation","volume":"21","issue":"5","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2017","dateOfInsertion":"08 May 2017","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7829385/","publicationDate":"May 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7829385/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002380","fundingName":"Hanyang University","grantNumber":"HY-2015-P"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy-Efficient Management of Cognitive Radio Terminals With Quality-Based Activation","sourcePdf":"lcomm-kim-2656910-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.065591S","chronDate":"May  2017","xplore-pub-id":"4234","isNumber":"7921536","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4234","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"7921536","articleId":"7829385","onlineDate":"23 January 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Letter","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7829386,"authors":[{"name":"Saijirou Yoshioka","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical and Energy Systems Engineering, Oita University, Oita, Japan"],"firstName":"Saijirou","lastName":"Yoshioka","id":"37086041572"},{"name":"Takafumi Tujigou","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical and Energy Systems Engineering, Oita University, Oita, Japan"],"firstName":"Takafumi","lastName":"Tujigou","id":"37086042259"},{"name":"Yuji Gotoh","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical and Energy Systems Engineering, Oita University, Oita, Japan"],"firstName":"Yuji","lastName":"Gotoh","orcid":"0000-0001-5977-9520","id":"37085459239"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9464"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0069"}],"articleNumber":"7829386","dbTime":"21 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":241},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Magnetics Society","url":"http://www.ieeemagnetics.org/"}],"abstract":"The nondestructive evaluation of the opposite side defects of the steel wall in the petrochemical plant is necessary for safe maintenance.

To reduce the feedback overhead, an effective codebook based on channel statistics has been designed, where the required number of feedback bits only scales linearly with the rank of the channel correlation matrix. However, this attractive conclusion was only proved under a particular channel assumption in the literature. To provide a rigorous theoretical proof under a general channel assumption, in this paper, we quantitatively analyze the performance of the channel-statistics-based codebook. Specifically, we first introduce the rate gap between the ideal case of perfect channel state information at the transmitter and the practical case of limited channel feedback, where we find that the rate gap depends on the quantization error of the codebook. Then, we derive an upper bound of the quantization error, based on which we prove that the required number of feedback bits to ensure a constant rate gap only scales linearly with the rank of the channel correlation matrix. Finally, numerical results are provided to verify this conclusion.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/25/8008868/07829396.pdf","startPage":"7553","endPage":"7557","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2017.2656908","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2017.2656908","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8008868","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7829396","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the Performance of Channel-Statistics-Based Codebook for Massive MIMO Channel Feedback","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Quantization (signal)","MIMO","Correlation","Precoding","Antenna feeds","Upper bound","Interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feedback","matrix algebra","MIMO communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel feedback overhead","massive multiple-input multiple-output systems","base station antennas","feedback bits","channel correlation matrix","channel assumption","channel-statistics-based codebook","perfect channel state information","limited channel feedback","quantization error","constant rate gap"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Channel feedback","codebook","massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)","performance analysis"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7829396/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 January 2017","displayDocTitle":"On the Performance of Channel-Statistics-Based Codebook for Massive MIMO Channel Feedback","volume":"66","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/7829396/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2017","accessionNumber":"17135851","dateOfInsertion":"11 August 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"National Key Basic Research Program of China","grantNumber":"2013CB329203"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61571270 and 61571267"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004826","fundingName":"Beijing Natural Science Foundation","grantNumber":"4142027"},{"fundingName":"Foundation of Shenzhen Government"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the Performance of Channel-Statistics-Based Codebook for Massive MIMO Channel Feedback","sourcePdf":"tvt-shen-2656908-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.087539S","chronDate":"Aug.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"8008868","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"8008868","articleId":"7829396","onlineDate":"23 January 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7829400,"authors":[{"name":"Kishore Jaganathan","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/7858803/7829400/jagan-2656844-small.gif","p":["Kishore Jaganathan was born in Tamil Nadu, India, in 1989.

Due to the absence of phase information, some form of additional information is required in order to be able to uniquely identify the signal of interest. In this paper, we focus our attention on discrete-time sparse signals (of length n). We first show that if the discrete Fourier transform dimension is greater than or equal to 2n, then almost all signals with aperiodic support can be uniquely identified by their Fourier transform magnitude (up to time shift, conjugate flip, and global phase). Then, we develop an efficient two-stage sparse-phase retrieval algorithm (TSPR), which involves: identifying the support, i.e., the locations of the nonzero components, of the signal using a combinatorial algorithm; and identifying the signal values in the support using a convex algorithm. We show that TSPR can provably recover most O(n\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1/2-\u03b5</sup>\n)-sparse signals (up to a time shift, conjugate flip, and global phase).

These recovery guarantees are asymptotic in nature. Numerical experiments complement our theoretical analysis and verify the effectiveness of TSPR.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sparse Phase Retrieval: Uniqueness Guarantees and Recovery Algorithms","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2017.2656844","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/78/7858803/07829400.pdf","startPage":"2402","endPage":"2410","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2017.2656844","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7858803","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7829400","chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/78/7858803/7829400-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7829400/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 January 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"May1, 1 2017","displayDocTitle":"Sparse Phase Retrieval: Uniqueness Guarantees and Recovery Algorithms","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"65","issue":"9","htmlLink":"/document/7829400/","dateOfInsertion":"24 February 2017","publicationDate":"1 May1, 2017","accessionNumber":"16705735","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"CCF-0729203, CNS-0932428 and CIF-1018927"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000006","fundingName":"Office of Naval Research","grantNumber":"N00014-08-1-0747"},{"fundingName":"Qualcomm, Inc."}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","chorusFlag":"true","title":"Sparse Phase Retrieval: Uniqueness Guarantees and Recovery Algorithms","sourcePdf":"tsp-jaganathan-2656844-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.178128S","chronDate":"May1, 1 2017","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"7858803","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"35","xplore-issue":"7858803","articleId":"7829400","onlineDate":"23 January 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7829401,"authors":[{"name":"Taha Bouchoucha","affiliation":["Computer, Electrical, Mathematical Sciences and Engineering, Division of King Abdullah University of Science and Technology, Thuwal, Saudi Arabia","University of California Davis, Davis, CA, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Taha Bouchoucha (S\u201914) received the Dipl\u00f4me\n d\u2019Ing\u00e9nieur degree from the Ecole Polytechnique de Tunisie, Carthage, Tunisia, in 2013, and the M.S.\n degree in electrical engineering from King Abdullah University of Science and Technology, Thuwal, Saudi Arabia, in\n 2015.

To design such waveforms, conventional MIMO radar methods use two steps. In the first step, the waveforms covariance matrix R is synthesized to achieve the desired beampattern. Whereas in the second step, to realize the synthesized covariance matrix, actual waveforms are designed. Most of the existing methods use iterative algorithms to solve these constrained optimization problems. The computational complexity of these algorithms is very high, which makes them difficult to use in practice. In this paper, to achieve the desired beampattern, a low complexity discrete-Fourier-transform based closed-form covariance matrix design technique is introduced for an MIMO radar. The designed covariance matrix is then exploited to derive a novel closed-form algorithm to directly design the finite-alphabet constant-envelope waveforms for the desired beampattern.

However, most of the existing SNSS methods do not distinguish if primary users (PUs) are present or absent in the concerned spectrum band and directly pursue support recovery of the PUs. This may lead to a high false alarm rate and a waste of computational cost. To address the issue, we propose a predecision algorithm, referred to as the pairwise channel energy ratio (PCER) detector, to determine the presence or absence of PUs prior to signal support recovery. The proposed detector is based on the popular modulated wideband converter (MWC) framework for SNSS, which has several advantages over other SNSS approaches. The PCER test statistic is constructed from compressed samples obtained by the MWC. The decision threshold and the detection probability are derived in closed form following the Neyman-Pearson criterion. Numerical results are presented to verify the theoretical calculation. The proposed PCER detection method is shown to be able to detect the existence of PUs in a wide range of signal-to-noise ratio, while being robust to noise uncertainty and does not need the prior knowledge of the PU signals. Additionally, our results show that the use of the PCER detector leads to a significant improvement of the correct support recovery rate of the PU signals.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Predecision for Wideband Spectrum Sensing With Sub-Nyquist Sampling","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2017.2656940","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/25/8008868/07829419.pdf","startPage":"6908","endPage":"6920","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2017.2656940","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8008868","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7829419","chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/25/8008868/7829419-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7829419/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 January 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2017","displayDocTitle":"Predecision for Wideband Spectrum Sensing With Sub-Nyquist Sampling","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"66","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/7829419/","dateOfInsertion":"11 August 2017","publicationDate":"Aug. 2017","accessionNumber":"17135885","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61501356 and 61471395"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"ECCS-1408182 and ECCS-1609393"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","chorusFlag":"true","title":"Predecision for Wideband Spectrum Sensing With Sub-Nyquist Sampling","sourcePdf":"tvt-xiong-2656940-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.109939S","chronDate":"Aug.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"8008868","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"8008868","articleId":"7829419","onlineDate":"23 January 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7829421,"authors":[{"name":"Jingwen Bai","affiliation":["Rice University, Houston, TX, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/7894295/7829421/bai-2656911-small.gif","p":["Jingwen Bai received the B.E degree in electronic science and technology from the Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China, in 2011, and the M.S and Ph.D. degrees in electrical and computer engineering from Rice University, Houston, TX, USA, in 2013 and 2016, respectively.

We characterize the up- and downlink ergodic achievable rates for the case of linear precoders and receivers. The rate analysis includes practical constraints, such as imperfect self-interference cancellation, channel estimation error, training overhead, and pilot contamination. We show that the $2\\times $ gain of full duplex over half-duplex system remains in the asymptotic regime, where the number of BS antennas grows infinitely large. We numerically evaluate the finite SNR and antenna performance, which reveals that full-duplex networks can use significantly fewer antennas to achieve spectral efficiency gain over the half-duplex counterparts. In addition, the overall full-duplex gains can be achieved under realistic 3GPP multi-cell network settings despite the increased interference introduced in the full-duplex networks.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Asymptotic Analysis of MIMO Multi-Cell Full-Duplex Networks","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2017.2656911","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7693/7894295/07829421.pdf","startPage":"2168","endPage":"2180","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2017.2656911","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7894295","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7829421","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7829421/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 January 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2017","displayDocTitle":"Asymptotic Analysis of MIMO Multi-Cell Full-Duplex Networks","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"16","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/7829421/","dateOfInsertion":"07 April 2017","publicationDate":"April 2017","accessionNumber":"16807577","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Intel Labs"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000144","fundingName":"Division of Computer and Network Systems","grantNumber":"1012921 and 1161596"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Asymptotic Analysis of MIMO Multi-Cell Full-Duplex Networks","sourcePdf":"twc-bai-2656911-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.107929S","chronDate":"April  2017","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"7894295","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"7894295","articleId":"7829421","onlineDate":"23 January 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7829422,"authors":[{"name":"Jun Wu","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical Engineering, Technical University of Denmark, Lyngby, Denmark"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/2945/8241790/7829422/wu-2655523-small.gif","p":["Jun Wu received the BEng degree in astronautics engineering, the PhD\n degree in mechanical engineering from Beihang University, Beijing, China, in 2006 and 2012, and the PhD degree in\n computer science from Technical University of Munich, Germany, in 2015.

These structures are lightweight and exhibit strong mechanical properties. In this paper, we present a method to generate bone-like porous structures as lightweight infill for additive manufacturing. Our method builds upon and extends voxel-wise topology optimization. In particular, for the purpose of generating sparse yet stable structures distributed in the interior of a given shape, we propose upper bounds on the localized material volume in the proximity of each voxel in the design domain. We then aggregate the local per-voxel constraints by their p-norm into an equivalent global constraint, in order to facilitate an efficient optimization process. Implemented on a high-resolution topology optimization framework, our results demonstrate mechanically optimized, detailed porous structures which mimic those found in nature. We further show variants of the optimized structures subject to different design specifications, and we analyze the optimality and robustness of the obtained structures.","doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2017.2655523","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2017.2655523","startPage":"1127","endPage":"1140","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","pdfPath":"/iel7/2945/8241790/07829422.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8241790","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Infill Optimization for Additive Manufacturing\u2014Approaching Bone-Like Porous Structures","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7829422/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb. 1 2018","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 January 2017","displayDocTitle":"Infill Optimization for Additive Manufacturing\u2014Approaching Bone-Like Porous Structures","volume":"24","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"29 December 2017","accessionNumber":"17436191","pubMedId":"28129160","publicationDate":"1 Feb. 2018","htmlLink":"/document/7829422/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004963","fundingName":"Seventh Framework Programme","grantNumber":"FP7/2007-2013"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000783","fundingName":"REA","grantNumber":"609405"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Infill Optimization for Additive Manufacturing\u2014Approaching Bone-Like Porous Structures","sourcePdf":"tvcg-wu-2655523-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.140642S","chronDate":"Feb. 1 2018","xplore-pub-id":"2945","isNumber":"8241790","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"2945","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"8241790","articleId":"7829422","onlineDate":"23 January 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"Traditional","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7829435,"authors":[{"name":"Abbas Kazemipour","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Maryland, College Park, MD, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/7858803/7829435/kazem-2656848-small.gif","p":["Abbas Kazemipour (S\u201912) received the B.Sc. degree in electrical\n and computer engineering from the University of Tehran, Tehran, Iran, and the M.Sc. degree in electrical engineering\n from the University of Maryland, College Park, MD, USA, in 2012 and 2016, respectively.

X-duplex relay can adaptively configure the connection between its RF chains and antenna to operate in either half-duplex (HD) or full-duplex (FD) mode, according to the instantaneous channel conditions. We first derive the distribution of the signal to interference plus noise ratio, based on which we then analyze the outage probability, average symbol error rate (SER), and average sum rate. We also investigate the X-duplex relay with power allocation and derive the lower bound and upper bound of the corresponding outage probability. Both analytical and simulated results show that the X-duplex relay achieves a better performance over pure FD and HD schemes in terms of SER, outage probability and average sum rate, and the performance floor caused by the residual self interference can be eliminated using flexible RF chain configurations.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2017.2656887","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7693/7874223/07829436.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7874223","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2017.2656887","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","startPage":"1868","endPage":"1880","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the Performance of X-Duplex Relaying","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7829436","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 January 2017","displayDocTitle":"On the Performance of X-Duplex Relaying","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7829436/","volume":"16","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/7829436/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 2017","accessionNumber":"16725066","dateOfInsertion":"08 March 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"National 863 project","grantNumber":"2015AA01A709 5G"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Nature Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"U1301255, 61461136002, 61371073 and 61671183"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000923","fundingName":"ARC","grantNumber":"DP150104019 and FT120100487"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the Performance of X-Duplex Relaying","sourcePdf":"twc-song-2656887-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.11477S","chronDate":"March  2017","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"7874223","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"7874223","articleId":"7829436","onlineDate":"23 January 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":7829438,"authors":[{"name":"Lei Zhang","affiliation":["5G Innovation Centre, Institute for Communication Systems, University of Surrey, Guildford, U.K."],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/7874223/7829438/zhang-2656904-small.gif","p":["Lei Zhang received the B.Eng. degree in communication engineering and the M.Sc. degree in electromagnetic fields and microwave technology from the Northwestern Polytechnic University, Xi\u2019an, China, in 2005 and 2008, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree from the Communications Research Group, The University of Sheffield, Sheffield, U.K. in 2011.

However, integrating multiple frame structures with different subcarrier spacing in one radio carrier may result in significant inter-service-band-interference (ISBI). In this paper, a framework for multi-service (MS) systems is established based on a subband filtered multi-carrier system. The subband filtering implementations and both asynchronous and generalized synchronous (GS) MS subband filtered multi-carrier (SFMC) systems have been proposed. Based on the GS-MS-SFMC system, the system model with ISBI is derived and a number of properties on ISBI are given. In addition, low-complexity ISBI cancelation algorithms are proposed by precoding the information symbols at the transmitter. For asynchronous MS-SFMC system in the presence of transceiver imperfections, including carrier frequency offset, timing offset, and phase noise, a complete analytical system model is established in terms of desired signal, inter-symbol-interference, inter-carrier-interference, ISBI, and noise. Thereafter, new channel equalization algorithms are proposed by considering the errors and imperfections. Numerical analysis shows that the analytical results match the simulation results, and the proposed ISBI cancelation and equalization algorithms can significantly improve the system performance in comparison with the existing algorithms.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7829438/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 January 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2017","volume":"16","issue":"3","accessionNumber":"16725094","dateOfInsertion":"08 March 2017","publicationDate":"March 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7829438/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Subband Filtered Multi-Carrier Systems for Multi-Service Wireless Communications","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Subband Filtered Multi-Carrier Systems for Multi-Service Wireless Communications","sourcePdf":"twc-zhang-2656904-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.157598S","chronDate":"March  2017","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"7874223","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"72","xplore-issue":"7874223","articleId":"7829438","onlineDate":"23 January 2017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7829465,"authors":[{"name":"Kiran Gunnam","affiliation":["Western Digital Corporation, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Kiran Gunnam (kgunnam@ieee.org) currently works as a technologist in the Storage Architecture Research Group of Western Digital Corporation.

In this article, we study the operation and properties of this circuit.","doi":"10.1109/MSSC.2016.2624178","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MSSC.2016.2624178","startPage":"9","endPage":"11","publicationTitle":"IEEE Solid-State Circuits Magazine","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Solid-State Circuits Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel7/4563670/7829424/07829485.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7829424","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The Switched-Capacitor Integrator [A Circuit for All Seasons]","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7829485/","chronOrPublicationDate":"winter  2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 January 2017","displayDocTitle":"The Switched-Capacitor Integrator [A Circuit for All Seasons]","volume":"9","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"23 January 2017","publicationDate":"winter 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7829485/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Switched-Capacitor Integrator [A Circuit for All Seasons]","sourcePdf":"09mssc01-circuitseasons-2624178-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.029755S","chronDate":"winter  2017","xplore-pub-id":"4563670","isNumber":"7829424","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4563670","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"7829424","articleId":"7829485","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7829517,"authors":[{"name":"Kamilya Smagulova","affiliation":["Bioinspired Microelectronics Systems Group, Nazarbayev University, Astana"],"firstName":"Kamilya","lastName":"Smagulova","id":"37086034957"},{"name":"Aigerim Tankimanova","affiliation":["Bioinspired Microelectronics Systems Group, Nazarbayev University, Astana"],"firstName":"Aigerim","lastName":"Tankimanova","id":"37086031514"},{"name":"Alex Pappachen James","affiliation":["Bioinspired Microelectronics Systems Group, Nazarbayev University, Astana"],"firstName":"Alex Pappachen","lastName":"James","id":"37391662800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-6170-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-6171-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7829517","dbTime":"25 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":270},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Memristors","Sensors","Dynamic range","MOSFET","Photoconductivity","Computer architecture"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS image sensors","leakage currents","memristors","MOSFET"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["circuit architecture","leakage current","memristor array","MOSFETS","wide dynamic range pixels","4T CMOS","3T CMOS","high speed signal processing","image sensor","image resolution","CMOS-memristor hybrid integrated pixel sensor"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Memristors","Pixels","Analog Circuits","CMOS"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7829517","abstract":"Increase in image resolution require the abilityof image sensors to pack an increased number of circuitcomponents in a given area.

This paper explores graphene based SRAM as a potential replacement of silicon SRAM for future digital electronics. Due to its higher current on-to-off ratio, the graphene nanoribbon field effect transistor (GNRFET) has been considered in this paper. In the nanometer regime, process variation is not only inevitable but also very pronounced. To mitigate its effects as much as possible, the Schottky-Barrier type GNRFET is considered which presents lower variation in its characteristics due to doping variation. The results show that graphene nanoribbon has a great potential in digital circuit design. The GNRFET based SRAM design presented in this paper leads to significantly lower power consumption, approximately 93% compared to 45 nm silicon technology. This upper bound can be quite achievable as the fabrication technology of graphene reaches maturity.","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE International Symposium on Nanoelectronic and Information Systems (iNIS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE International Symposium on Nanoelectronic and Information Systems (iNIS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7827705/7829498/07829526.pdf","startPage":"76","endPage":"79","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Graphene Nanoribbon Field Effect Transistor Based Ultra-Low Energy SRAM Design","doi":"10.1109/iNIS.2016.028","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7829498","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/iNIS.2016.028","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7829526","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7829526/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-21 Dec. 2016","displayDocTitle":"Graphene Nanoribbon Field Effect Transistor Based Ultra-Low Energy SRAM Design","dateOfInsertion":"26 January 2017","publicationDate":"Dec. 2016","accessionNumber":"16622610","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"19-21 Dec. 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7829526/","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Graphene Nanoribbon Field Effect Transistor Based Ultra-Low Energy SRAM Design","confLoc":"Gwalior, India","sourcePdf":"6170a076.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062159S","chronDate":"19-21 Dec. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7827705","isNumber":"7829498","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7827705","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"7829498","articleId":"7829526","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7829529,"authors":[{"name":"Vivek Kumar","affiliation":["Department of Information Technology, ABV-Indian Institute of Information Technology and Management, Gwalior, Madhya Pradesh, India"],"firstName":"Vivek","lastName":"Kumar","id":"37086182103"},{"name":"Vikas Mahor","affiliation":["Department of Information Technology, ABV-Indian Institute of Information Technology and Management, Gwalior, Madhya Pradesh, India"],"firstName":"Vikas","lastName":"Mahor","id":"38232728800"},{"name":"Manisha Pattanaik","affiliation":["Department of Information Technology, ABV-Indian Institute of Information Technology and Management, Gwalior, Madhya Pradesh, India"],"firstName":"Manisha","lastName":"Pattanaik","id":"37398662600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-6170-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-6171-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7829529","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":288},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Novel Ultra Low Leakage FinFET Based SRAM Cell","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE International Symposium on Nanoelectronic and Information Systems (iNIS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7827705/7829498/07829529.pdf","startPage":"89","endPage":"92","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE International Symposium on Nanoelectronic and Information Systems (iNIS)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/iNIS.2016.031","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7829498","doi":"10.1109/iNIS.2016.031","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Information systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["leakage currents","MOSFET circuits","SRAM chips"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ultra low leakage FinFET","battery operated devices","low leakage current","next generation technologies","FinFET device","FinFET 6T SRAM cell","HPSICE simulation","BSIM technology"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["FinFET","leakage power","SRAM"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7829529","abstract":"To make portable battery operated devices moreefficient with low leakage current is a major challenge with the technology scaling.

However, leakage current still remains comparable to device ONcurrent at highly scaled technology nodes. Continuous voltage supply to retain the data in SRAM cell contributes a major part of leakage current in any processor design. This paper proposed a novel circuit technique to reduce the leakage current and power consumption of SRAM cell.

In an effort to conserve environment, electrical energy usage is gradually shifting towards renewable and green energy sources, such as wind, hydro, and solar. Regardless of power sources, a user demands for continuous energy supply and also desires to minimize the electricity bill. Further, in a dynamic pricing environment, the price of electricity varies throughout the day. In such a dynamic pricing environment, appliance scheduling with multiple power sources tied to a smart home/building is an important research problem. In this paper, we propose a methodology to abet green environment by prioritizing green energy sources and to minimize the electricity cost for the user. Our proposed methodology leverages a smart grid architecture which employs a greedy strategy to select the most feasible power source amongst the available power sources tied to a smart home/building. Our proposed methodology further leverages a neural network-based approach for appliance scheduling that optimizes the use of power sources in a dynamic pricing environment to minimize the total cost of electricity usage.","doi":"10.1109/iNIS.2016.046","pdfPath":"/iel7/7827705/7829498/07829544.pdf","startPage":"166","endPage":"171","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE International Symposium on Nanoelectronic and Information Systems (iNIS)","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE International Symposium on Nanoelectronic and Information Systems (iNIS)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/iNIS.2016.046","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7829498","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Neural Network-Based Appliance Scheduling Methodology for Smart Homes and Buildings with Multiple Power Sources","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7829544/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-21 Dec. 2016","displayDocTitle":"A Neural Network-Based Appliance Scheduling Methodology for Smart Homes and Buildings with Multiple Power Sources","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"26 January 2017","accessionNumber":"16622592","publicationDate":"Dec. 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7829544/","conferenceDate":"19-21 Dec. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Neural Network-Based Appliance Scheduling Methodology for Smart Homes and Buildings with Multiple Power Sources","confLoc":"Gwalior, India","sourcePdf":"6170a166.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.081211S","chronDate":"19-21 Dec. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7827705","isNumber":"7829498","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7827705","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"7829498","articleId":"7829544","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7829546,"authors":[{"name":"Naini Satheesh","affiliation":["National Institute of Technology, Rourkela"],"firstName":"Naini","lastName":"Satheesh","id":"37086134681"},{"name":"Abhishek Mahapatra","affiliation":["National Institute of Technology, Rourkela"],"firstName":"Abhishek","lastName":"Mahapatra","id":"37086097074"},{"name":"Sudeendra Kumar K.","affiliation":["National Institute of Technology, Rourkela"],"firstName":"Sudeendra Kumar","lastName":"K.","id":"37086175853"},{"name":"Sauvagya Sahoo","affiliation":["National Institute of Technology, Rourkela"],"firstName":"Sauvagya","lastName":"Sahoo","id":"38244735400"},{"name":"K.

PUFs are useful security architectures used for identification, authentication and cryptographic key generation. Many PUF topologies are proposed in the past targeting both ASIC and FPGA. It is nearly impossible to get two PUF circuits with same characteristics for the same design. PUFs make use of random process variation occurring during manufacturing of IC which is uncontrollable. The most versatile PUF is ring oscillator (RO) PUF, in which the frequencies of ring oscillators are compared to produce the PUF response. The conventional approach consumes large number of ring oscillators and requires all RO's to be mutually symmetric. In this paper, we have proposed a RO-PUF for FPGA devices, which is capable of generating multiple output bits from each ring oscillator with better security metrics in comparison with PUF designed with similar technique. The PUF is implemented on Xilinx Spartan 3E FPGA boards and the challenge-response pairs (CRP) are verified for statistical properties.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7829546/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-21 Dec. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"Dec. 2016","accessionNumber":"16622623","htmlLink":"/document/7829546/","dateOfInsertion":"26 January 2017","conferenceDate":"19-21 Dec. 2016","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A Modified RO-PUF with Improved Security Metrics on FPGA","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Modified RO-PUF with Improved Security Metrics on FPGA","confLoc":"Gwalior, India","sourcePdf":"6170a178.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063801S","chronDate":"19-21 Dec. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7827705","isNumber":"7829498","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7827705","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"7829498","articleId":"7829546","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7829559,"authors":[{"name":"Muhammad Khalid","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, PDPM Indian Institute of Information Technology Design and Manufacturing, Jabalpur, MP, India"],"firstName":"Muhammad","lastName":"Khalid","id":"37085991409"},{"name":"Jawar Singh","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, PDPM Indian Institute of Information Technology Design and Manufacturing, Jabalpur, MP, India"],"firstName":"Jawar","lastName":"Singh","id":"37397123000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-6170-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-6171-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7829559","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":394},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Memristor Crossbar-Based Pattern Recognition Circuit Using Perceptron Learning Rule","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE International Symposium on Nanoelectronic and Information Systems (iNIS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7827705/7829498/07829559.pdf","startPage":"236","endPage":"239","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE International Symposium on Nanoelectronic and Information Systems (iNIS)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/iNIS.2016.061","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7829498","doi":"10.1109/iNIS.2016.061","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Logic gates","Transistors","Training","Memristors","Pattern recognition","Neurons","Integrated circuit modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["learning (artificial intelligence)","memristor circuits","neural chips","operational amplifiers","pattern recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Op-Amp based neuron circuit","operational amplifier","synaptic network","memristor crossbar based training circuit module","perceptron learning rule","memristor crossbar-based pattern recognition circuit"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Memristor","pattern recognition","neuron model"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7829559","abstract":"This paper presents a memristor crossbar-basedpattern recognition circuit using perceptron learning rule.

The algorithm is evaluated on a suite of well-known benchmark optimization functions. The experiments are performed on an NVIDIA GeForce GTX 980 GPU and a single core of 3.20 GHz Intel Core i5 4570 CPU and the test results demonstrate that the GPU algorithm runs about maximum 46 times faster than the corresponding CPU algorithm.

This work builds upon a previous study analysing classifiers' performance on pose recognition, considering multiple factors, such as the machine learning methods applied, the sensors used for data collection, as well as data interpretation and sample size. As for the classification of time series gestures, we analyse similar factors, by constructing several one-hand gesture databases that are used to train and test the Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) and Hidden Markov Models (HMM) algorithms. We observed no significant difference in classification accuracy between the results obtained with the two sensors on time series data, although Kinect 2 performs better in pose recognition. Overall, DTW obtained the best accuracy for Kinect 1 time series data, on datasets with fewer samples per class (about 15), the accuracy decreasing drastically with the increase of the number of samples for each class (from 97.8% drops to 66.6%). However, for HMM the accuracy is similar or higher (between 90.7% and 94.9%) for databases with more samples per class (up to 90 entries) than for those with fewer, which makes it preferable to use in a dynamic system.","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 18th International Symposium on Symbolic and Numeric Algorithms for Scientific Computing (SYNASC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7827704/7829572/07829621.pdf","startPage":"264","endPage":"271","publicationTitle":"2016 18th International Symposium on Symbolic and Numeric Algorithms for Scientific Computing (SYNASC)","doi":"10.1109/SYNASC.2016.049","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SYNASC.2016.049","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7829572","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7829621","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Gesture Recognition on Kinect Time Series Data Using Dynamic Time Warping and Hidden Markov Models","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hidden Markov models","Heuristic algorithms","Time series analysis","Sensors","Databases","Gesture recognition","Algorithm design and analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["gesture recognition","hidden Markov models","image classification","image sensors","learning (artificial intelligence)","pose estimation","time series","visual databases"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["gesture recognition","Kinect time series data","dynamic time warping","hidden Markov models","time series classifiers","XBox 360","XBox One","Kinect sensor","classifier performance analysis","pose recognition","machine learning methods","data collection","data interpretation","sample size","time series gesture classification","one-hand gesture databases","DTW","HMM"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["gesture recognition","Kinect","Dynamic Time Warping","Hidden Markov Models","time series"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7829621/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-27 Sept. 2016","displayDocTitle":"Gesture Recognition on Kinect Time Series Data Using Dynamic Time Warping and Hidden Markov Models","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7829621/","publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","accessionNumber":"16622576","dateOfInsertion":"26 January 2017","conferenceDate":"24-27 Sept. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Gesture Recognition on Kinect Time Series Data Using Dynamic Time Warping and Hidden Markov Models","confLoc":"Timisoara, Romania","sourcePdf":"5707a264.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073008S","chronDate":"24-27 Sept. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7827704","isNumber":"7829572","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7827704","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"7829572","articleId":"7829621","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7829625,"authors":[{"name":"Dragos Teodor Gavrilut","affiliation":["\u201cAl.

The most widely used technique to control a botnet is to try to connect to many domain names, generated according to an algorithm called domain generating algorithm (DGA). In this paper we present different algorithms that can determine if a computer is part of a botnet by looking at its network traffic. Since in some cases the network traffic is impossible to be shared due to privacy reasons we also analyze the case where just limited information can be provided (such as a netflow log). The algorithms presented here were obtained after reverse engineering and analyzing the DGA of 18 different botnets including some that were taken down (such as Cryptolocker) and ones that are still alive and thriving (such as PushDo, Tinba, Nivdort, DirtyLocker, Dobot, Patriot, Ramdo, Virut, Ramnit and many more).","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 18th International Symposium on Symbolic and Numeric Algorithms for Scientific Computing (SYNASC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7827704/7829572/07829625.pdf","startPage":"292","endPage":"299","publicationTitle":"2016 18th International Symposium on Symbolic and Numeric Algorithms for Scientific Computing (SYNASC)","doi":"10.1109/SYNASC.2016.053","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SYNASC.2016.053","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7829572","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7829625","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Identifying DGA-Based Botnets Using Network Anomaly Detection","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Malware","Monitoring","Cryptography","Servers","Computers","Privacy","IP networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer network security","invasive software","telecommunication traffic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["DGA-based botnet identifying","network anomaly detection","domain generating algorithm","DGA","network traffic","reverse engineering"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["botnets","anomaly detection","netflow","DGA","DNS","Cryptolocker","Tinba","Patriot","Ramdo","Ramnit","PushDo"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7829625/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-27 Sept. 2016","displayDocTitle":"Identifying DGA-Based Botnets Using Network Anomaly Detection","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7829625/","publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","accessionNumber":"16622551","dateOfInsertion":"26 January 2017","conferenceDate":"24-27 Sept. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Identifying DGA-Based Botnets Using Network Anomaly Detection","confLoc":"Timisoara, Romania","sourcePdf":"5707a292.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064314S","chronDate":"24-27 Sept. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7827704","isNumber":"7829572","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7827704","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"7829572","articleId":"7829625","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7829631,"authors":[{"name":"Croitoru Nicolae-Eugen","affiliation":["Universitatea Alexandru Ioan Cuza, Iasi, RO"],"firstName":"Croitoru","lastName":"Nicolae-Eugen","id":"37087634860"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-5707-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-5708-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2470-881X"}],"articleNumber":"7829631","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":140},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7829631","abstract":"Artificial Neural Networks often suffer from overfitting, both when trained through backpropagation or evolved through a Genetic Algorithm.

Fusion Method Based on Improved NSCT Transform and PCNN Model","abstract":"Multi-source image fusion has been the hotspot of research in recent years, in order to make the fusion results more consistent with human vision and computer processing, many classical algorithms have been proposed, such as contourlet transform, non-subsampled contourlet transform (NSCT)and so on. On this basis, this paper proposes an improved fusion method of infrared and visible images based on NSCT transform and pulse coupled neural network (PCNN). The basic idea is that the source images are decomposed by NSCT to obtain low frequency and high frequency bands, low frequency components use the regional variance saliency fusion method of adaptive threshold weighted, high frequency components use the PCNN method, and high frequency subband coefficients are directly used as external inputs of PCNN neurons. Experimental results show that the fused image has higher clarity and richer useful information. Both subjective and objective performance indicators are better than the traditional algorithm.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7829669/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-11 Dec. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"26 January 2017","publicationDate":"Dec. 2016","accessionNumber":"16637606","htmlLink":"/document/7829669/","conferenceDate":"10-11 Dec. 2016","isConference":true,"volume":"1","isDynamicHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Image Fusion Method Based on Improved NSCT Transform and PCNN Model","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Image Fusion Method Based on Improved NSCT Transform and PCNN Model","confLoc":"Hangzhou, China","sourcePdf":"3558a028.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055069S","chronDate":"10-11 Dec. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7823889","isNumber":"7829654","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7823889","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7829654","articleId":"7829669","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7829679,"authors":[{"name":"Yihu Li","affiliation":["Nanyang Technological University, Singapore","CAEP, Terahertz Research Center, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Yihu","lastName":"Li","id":"38240571100"},{"name":"Wang-Ling Goh","affiliation":["Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"firstName":"Wang-Ling","lastName":"Goh","id":"37282097000"},{"name":"Hailin Tang","affiliation":["CAEP, Terahertz Research Center, Chengdu, China"],"lastName":"Hailin Tang","id":"37087157362"},{"name":"Haitao Liu","affiliation":["CAEP, Terahertz Research Center, Chengdu, China"],"lastName":"Haitao Liu","id":"37087424585"},{"name":"Xiaodong Deng","affiliation":["CAEP, Terahertz Research Center, Chengdu, China"],"lastName":"Xiaodong Deng","id":"37087158838"},{"name":"Yong-Zhong Xiong","affiliation":["CAEP, Terahertz Research Center, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Yong-Zhong","lastName":"Xiong","id":"37404017900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-9019-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-9018-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-9020-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7829679","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":12,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":859},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Gain","Bandwidth","Distributed amplifiers","Silicon germanium","Power amplifiers","Transistors","Capacitors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed amplifiers","Ge-Si alloys","heterojunction bipolar transistors","microwave amplifiers","millimetre wave amplifiers","power consumption","wideband amplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["HBT","ultra-broadband distributed amplifier","three-level stacked transistor structure","loss compensation","bonding pads","on-chip RF choking inductors","DC blocking capacitors","power consumption","frequency 10 GHz to 170 GHz","size 130 nm","size 1.3 mm","size 0.7 mm","gain 19 dB","power 560 mW","voltage 4.5 V","SiGe"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["broad band","distributed amplifier","stacked transistor","loss compensation"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7829679","abstract":"This paper presents an ultra-broadband distributed amplifier (DA).

During the past decade, the discrete cosine transform (DCT) has been used for data compression in bio-medical application due to its high energy efficiency. In this paper, a multiplication-free integer DCT processor based on a parallel-pipelined architecture is proposed. The novel integer DCT processor utilizes a parallel structure to reduce the latency to 6 clock cycles as compared to the conventional hardware design. Ultra-low-voltage operation is adopted to improve the energy efficiency together with parallel processing. The new integer DCT processor is implemented on 0.18-\u03bcm CMOS process with 0.6-V supply voltage and it can achieve a DCT transform in 240 ns with power consumption of only 83.5 \u03bcW at 25 MHz,

The transformer-based power-combining PA consists of several unit amplifiers, operating in Class AB for both good back-off efficiency and linearity.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power generation","Linearity","Couplings","CMOS technology","Impedance matching","Mars","Millimeter wave technology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS integrated circuits","integrated circuit design","power amplifiers","power combiners"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power back-off","CMOS power amplifier","neutralized amplifier stage","transformer-based power-combining PA","frequency 60 GHz"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["60-GHz","power amplifier","CMOS","Class AB","efficiency","linearity","back-off","power combining","transformer"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ISICIR.2016.7829705","publicationTitle":"2016 International Symposium on Integrated Circuits (ISIC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 International Symposium on Integrated Circuits (ISIC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7822827/7829673/07829705.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"3","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7829673","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISICIR.2016.7829705","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A 60-GHz power amplifier with efficiency enhancement at power back-off","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7829705","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A 60-GHz power amplifier with efficiency enhancement at power back-off","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7829705/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7829705/","accessionNumber":"16622019","conferenceDate":"12-14 Dec. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"26 January 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 Dec. 2016","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A 60-GHz power amplifier with efficiency enhancement at power back-off","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"163PID4490949.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050337S","chronDate":"12-14 Dec. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7822827","isNumber":"7829673","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7822827","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7829673","articleId":"7829705","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":7829714,"authors":[{"name":"Uday Dasgupta","affiliation":["MediaTek Singapore Pte Ltd, Singapore"],"firstName":"Uday","lastName":"Dasgupta","id":"37332499400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-9019-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-9018-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-9020-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7829714","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":732},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power harmonic filters","Gain","Matched filters","Power supplies","Low-pass filters","Topology","MOS devices"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS integrated circuits","differential amplifiers","integrated circuit manufacture","low-power electronics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["push-pull output amplifiers","CMOS technology","multi-stage amplifiers","2-stage amplifier","3-stage amplifier","p-channel devices","n-channel devices","size 65 nm","voltage 0.35 V","voltage 0.5 V","voltage 0.7 V to 1.5 V","Si"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Two-stage amplifiers","Three-stage amplifiers","Multi-stage amplifiers","Frequency compensation","Low voltage","Push-Pull output stage"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7829714","abstract":"A new low-voltage push-pull output stage is proposed.

Unfortunately, this goes along with power hungry systems and more complex integrated circuits. A novel receiver architecture, which addresses these issues, is based on the simultaneous phase and amplitude regenerative sampling system. Its system exploits switched injection-locked oscillators and their capability to regenerate signals with a gain of over 40 dB. This paper demonstrates an integrated solution for phase demodulation in such an architecture. The proposed concept uses the low complex but efficient self-mixing principle and consists mainly of double-balanced Gilbert mixers, amplifiers, a delay line and passive power dividers. The detection of the phase is achieved through self-mixing the regenerated signal with one path delayed by a symbol period.

A widely studied countermeasure for minimizing the side-channel leakage is to smoothen the leakage by means of a complementary dual-rail compensation. However, the silicon process variation (PV) has been proved to be an intrinsic pitfall which undermines the dual-rail balance. In this paper, a thermal based approach for minimizing the PV influence on the power balance of a lightweight block cipher, in pipelined symmetric dual-rail architecture, is presented. Practical evaluation is conducted on FPGA for verifying its security escalation. The experimental results certify that the thermal protected cipher with enhanced dual-rail architecture has gained higher resistance against the correlation power attacks.","doi":"10.1109/ISICIR.2016.7829741","publicationTitle":"2016 International Symposium on Integrated Circuits (ISIC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 International Symposium on Integrated Circuits (ISIC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7822827/7829673/07829741.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISICIR.2016.7829741","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7829673","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Thermal brings security: A roadmap to mitigate silicon bias influence for symmetric dual-rail logic","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7829741","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 Dec. 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7829741/","displayDocTitle":"Thermal brings security: A roadmap to mitigate silicon bias influence for symmetric dual-rail logic","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2016","accessionNumber":"16622059","htmlLink":"/document/7829741/","conferenceDate":"12-14 Dec. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"26 January 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Thermal brings security: A roadmap to mitigate silicon bias influence for symmetric dual-rail logic","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"76PID4507167.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047562S","chronDate":"12-14 Dec. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7822827","isNumber":"7829673","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7822827","xplore-issue":"7829673","articleId":"7829741","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7829751,"authors":[{"name":"Yiping Zhang","affiliation":["School of Urban Rail Translation, Soochow University, Suzhou, P.R.

In order to fulfill the requirements of Real-Time processing and no data losses, we carry out a design that consists of a pattern of dynamic tree of process pipelines, where the number of branches increases proportionally to the input data rate. Two different approaches have been followed to implement this design pattern: one based in a well-known set of products from the Big Data ecosystem; and the other built with Kafka, Zookeeper and a set of components designed and implemented by us. These two implementations have been compared in terms of velocity and scalability performance. As a result, the implementation built with our own components is significantly faster and scalable than the traditional one. The good results obtained by using both the design pattern of dynamic tree of process pipelines and our implementation make them very suitable for its use in other scenarios and applications such as smart cities, environment monitoring, industry 4.0, distributed control systems, etc.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A \u201cFast Data\u201d architecture: Dashboard for anomalous traffic analysis in data networks","publicationTitle":"2016 Eleventh International Conference on Digital Information Management (ICDIM)","doi":"10.1109/ICDIM.2016.7829756","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 Eleventh International Conference on Digital Information Management (ICDIM)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7813523/7829753/07829756.pdf","startPage":"37","endPage":"42","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICDIM.2016.7829756","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7829753","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7829756","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7829756/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-21 Sept. 2016","displayDocTitle":"A \u201cFast Data\u201d architecture: Dashboard for anomalous traffic analysis in data networks","conferenceDate":"19-21 Sept. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7829756/","dateOfInsertion":"26 January 2017","publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","accessionNumber":"16621152","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A \u201cFast Data\u201d architecture: Dashboard for anomalous traffic analysis in data networks","confLoc":"Porto, Portugal","sourcePdf":"167.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.076727S","chronDate":"19-21 Sept. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7813523","isNumber":"7829753","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7813523","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7829753","articleId":"7829756","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7829893,"authors":[{"name":"Titus Nanda Kumara","affiliation":["University of Peradeniya, Peradeniya, Central, LK"],"firstName":"Titus Nanda","lastName":"Kumara"},{"name":"Hasindu Gamaarachchi","affiliation":["University of Peradeniya, Peradeniya, Central, LK"],"firstName":"Hasindu","lastName":"Gamaarachchi"},{"name":"Geesara Prathap","affiliation":["University of Peradeniya, Peradeniya, Central, LK"],"firstName":"Geesara","lastName":"Prathap"},{"name":"Roshan Ragel","affiliation":["Department of Computer Engineering, University of Peradeniya, Peradeniya, Sri Lanka"],"firstName":"Roshan","lastName":"Ragel","id":"37399021100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-6078-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-6077-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-5090-6076-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-6079-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2472-7598"}],"articleNumber":"7829893","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":176},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Algorithm design and analysis","Graphics processing units","Central Processing Unit","Parallel processing","Libraries","Symmetric matrices","Acceleration"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["blind source separation","graphics processing units","independent component analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hybrid fast-ICA implementation","independent component analysis","blind source separation problem","GPGPU technologies","matrix operations"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Fast-ICA","BCI","CUDA","GPU","Accelerated Fast-ICA","ICA"]}],"abstract":"Independent Component Analysis is proposed as a solution to the Blind Source Separation problem.

Therefore, researchers in the past have considered accelerating Fast-ICA with the assistance of emerging GPGPU technologies. Such accelerations are effective because Fast-ICA makes use of a vast number of matrix operations which GPGPU are good at. However, all such previous works have focused on a particular application and therefore cannot be considered as generalized approaches for different data sizes. Therefore, in this paper, we concentrate on proposing a generalized and hybrid Fast-ICA implementation that makes use of the CPU and the GPGPU at their best possible capacities. We recommend an approach, where, depends on the data size, the different components of the Fast-ICA algorithm is suggested to be run on either CPU or GPGPU for the best performance. We achieve this via performing a deep analysis and profiling of the Fast-ICA algorithm on both the CPU and GPGPU and identifying the limitations and boundaries of the algorithm.","doi":"10.1109/ICTER.2016.7829893","publicationTitle":"2016 Sixteenth International Conference on Advances in ICT for Emerging Regions (ICTer)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 Sixteenth International Conference on Advances in ICT for Emerging Regions (ICTer)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7822830/7829879/07829893.pdf","startPage":"13","endPage":"20","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICTER.2016.7829893","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7829879","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Generalized and hybrid fast-ICA implementation using GPU","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7829893","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-3 Sept. 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7829893/","displayDocTitle":"Generalized and hybrid fast-ICA implementation using GPU","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","accessionNumber":"16622153","htmlLink":"/document/7829893/","conferenceDate":"1-3 Sept. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"26 January 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Generalized and hybrid fast-ICA implementation using GPU","confLoc":"Negombo, Sri Lanka","sourcePdf":"13_DC2_13-20.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068835S","chronDate":"1-3 Sept. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7822830","isNumber":"7829879","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7822830","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7829879","articleId":"7829893","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7829928,"authors":[{"name":"Chamitha Ramal Narawita","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Informatics Institute of Technology, Sri Lanka"],"firstName":"Chamitha Ramal","lastName":"Narawita","id":"37086175300"},{"name":"Kaneeka Vidanage","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Informatics Institute of Technology, Sri Lanka"],"firstName":"Kaneeka","lastName":"Vidanage","id":"37086065197"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-6078-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-6077-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-5090-6076-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-6079-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2472-7598"}],"articleNumber":"7829928","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":250},"abstract":"This research mainly focused on automation of Unified Modeling Language (UML) diagrams from the analyzed requirement text using Natural Language Processing (NLP).
