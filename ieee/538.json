The spectrum of interest is divided into independent channels licensed to the primary users. Channel assignment and power control must be carried out in the cognitive network so that no excessive interference is caused to the primary users in the overlaid network. We are interested in the downlink channel assignment and power control problem for a cognitive radio network, with the objective of maximizing the total throughput of all secondary users. We first develop a mathematical model and present a mixed integer linear programming formulation, which is generally NP-hard. Subsequently, to obtain a suboptimal control scheme with lower complexity, we develop a distributed optimization algorithm that iteratively increases the overall cognitive radio network throughput. Through simulation results, we compare the performance of the distributed optimization algorithm with the optimal and validate its efficacy.","doi":"10.1109/MILCOM.2009.5380005","displayPublicationTitle":"MILCOM 2009 - 2009 IEEE Military Communications Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5368705/5379707/05380005.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5379707","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MILCOM.2009.5380005","publicationTitle":"MILCOM 2009 - 2009 IEEE Military Communications Conference","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Maximizing throughput for overlaid cognitive radio networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5380005","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 Oct. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Maximizing throughput for overlaid cognitive radio networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5380005/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5380005/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","accessionNumber":"11104355","dateOfInsertion":"15 January 2010","conferenceDate":"18-21 Oct. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Maximizing throughput for overlaid cognitive radio networks","confLoc":"Boston, MA","sourcePdf":"901433.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049517S","chronDate":"18-21 Oct. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5368705","isNumber":"5379707","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5368705","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5379707","articleId":"5380005","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-12"},{"_id":5380012,"authors":[{"name":"Michael Rice","affiliation":["Department Electrical & Computer Engineering, Brigham Young University, Provo, UT, USA"],"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Rice","id":"37280227500"},{"name":"Erik Perrins","affiliation":["Department Electrical Engineering & Computer Science, University of Kansas, Lawrence, KS, USA"],"firstName":"Erik","lastName":"Perrins","id":"37280229000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5238-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-5239-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2155-7578"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2155-7586"}],"articleNumber":"5380012","dbTime":"15 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":352},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Quadrature phase shift keying","Frequency estimation","Phase estimation","Timing","Pulse shaping methods","Frequency synchronization","Feedforward systems","Covariance matrix","Computer science","Digital communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["pulse shaping","quadrature phase shift keying"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["burst-mode offset QPSK","Crame\u00bfr-Rao bound","joint estimator","carrier frequency offset","carrier phase offset","symbol timing offset","half-sine pulse shaping"]}],"abstract":"The Crame\u00bfr-Rao bound for the joint estimator of carrier frequency offset, carrier phase offset, and symbol timing offset for offset QPSK is derived and used to identify \u00bfgood\u00bf training sequences.

Our work deals with spectrum detection and recognition under the umbrella of cognitive radio. In the procedure of spectrum recognition, a frequency sweeping device sweeps the wideband spectrum and the samples of the wideband power spectrum density (PSD) are fed into different hidden Markov models (HMMs) sequentially. The core idea of sequential detection or quickest detection is borrowed and utilized here from the classical detection theory. In our proposed approach, forward variables from different HMMs are sequentially exploited to generate the decision statistics. The decision can be made any time as long as the condition is met. The motivation of our work is to detect the availability of spectra and recognize the spectra as quickly as possible and thus shorten the time delay of detection so as to improve the spectrum utilization. The PSDs of Wi-Fi signal, CDMA signal and GSM signal are measured using a spectrum analyzer (SA). These acquired data are used to train HMMs beforehand. Meanwhile, a fourth HMM is trained by the PSD of blank spectrum. Experimental results shows this proposed approach is effective.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MILCOM.2009.5380014","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5379707","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","displayPublicationTitle":"MILCOM 2009 - 2009 IEEE Military Communications Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5368705/5379707/05380014.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Quickest spectrum detection using hidden Markov Model for cognitive radio","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5380014/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 Oct. 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5380014/","displayDocTitle":"Quickest spectrum detection using hidden Markov Model for cognitive radio","conferenceDate":"18-21 Oct. 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","accessionNumber":"11104358","dateOfInsertion":"15 January 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Quickest spectrum detection using hidden Markov Model for cognitive radio","confLoc":"Boston, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"901308.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064296S","chronDate":"18-21 Oct. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5368705","isNumber":"5379707","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5368705","citationCount":"24","xplore-issue":"5379707","articleId":"5380014","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5380015,"authors":[{"name":"Ilmu Byun","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Yonsei University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Ilmu","lastName":"Byun","id":"37299909200"},{"name":"Kwang Soon Kim","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Yonsei University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Kwang Soon","lastName":"Kim","id":"37280249300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5238-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-5239-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2155-7578"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2155-7586"}],"articleNumber":"5380015","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":180},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Throughput","Decoding","Protocols","Hidden Markov models","Cognitive radio","Frequency","Pattern recognition","Virtual manufacturing","Wideband","Delay effects"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["automatic repeat request","computer networks","radiocommunication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["maximum achievable throughput","decode-and-forward","hybrid ARQ protocol","cooperative HARQ protocol","asymptotic outage probability"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5380015","doi":"10.1109/MILCOM.2009.5380015","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MILCOM.2009.5380015","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5379707","publicationTitle":"MILCOM 2009 - 2009 IEEE Military Communications Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"MILCOM 2009 - 2009 IEEE Military Communications Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5368705/5379707/05380015.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The maximum achievable throughput of a decode-and-forward based hybrid-ARQ protocol","abstract":"Cooperative hybrid-ARQ (HARQ) protocols have been widely studied because they are more efficient than cooperative protocols without HARQ.

The average bit-error rate (BER) performance is analyzed for the relay under average power scaling (APS) and instantaneous power scaling (IPS) constraints. We demonstrate that this network operating in two time slots not only improves spectrum efficiency, but also achieves the same BER performance as that working in four time slots under the same total and individual power constraints. Both analytical and simulation results show that a user will have a lower error probability of detecting the other user's signals if this user has a worse channel condition with the relay. In addition, IPS achieves better performance than APS but costs higher computing load for the relay.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5380019/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 Oct. 2009","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"18-21 Oct. 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5380019/","dateOfInsertion":"15 January 2010","publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","accessionNumber":"11085699","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Performance of two-way amplify-and-forward relay networks over asymmetric channels","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance of two-way amplify-and-forward relay networks over asymmetric channels","confLoc":"Boston, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"901351.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048877S","chronDate":"18-21 Oct. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5368705","isNumber":"5379707","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5368705","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"5379707","articleId":"5380019","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5380020,"authors":[{"name":"Sherry Wang","affiliation":["Applied Physics Laboratory, Johns Hopkins University, USA"],"lastName":"Sherry Wang","id":"37441132900"},{"name":"Harold Zheng","affiliation":["Applied Physics Laboratory, Johns Hopkins University, USA"],"lastName":"Harold Zheng","id":"37437390400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5238-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-5239-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2155-7578"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2155-7586"}],"articleNumber":"5380020","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1100},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Resource management","Cognitive radio","Ad hoc networks","Communication system traffic control","Intelligent networks","Filling","Proposals","Cross layer design","Physical layer","Media Access Protocol"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ad hoc networks","cognitive radio","resource allocation","telecommunication network management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["resource management design","cognitive radio ad hoc networks","radio spectrum gaps","cognitive radio network","resource allocation","radio transmission environment","cognitive resource management","cognitive radio ad hoc network environment","cross layer design","physical layer","medium access control layer","application layer"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Ad hoc networks","Cognitive radio networks","QoS","Resource management","Wireless"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A resource management design for cognitive radio ad hoc networks","doi":"10.1109/MILCOM.2009.5380020","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5379707","endPage":"7","publicationTitle":"MILCOM 2009 - 2009 IEEE Military Communications Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"MILCOM 2009 - 2009 IEEE Military Communications Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5368705/5379707/05380020.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MILCOM.2009.5380020","startPage":"1","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5380020","abstract":"To fully utilize radio resources by intelligently filling in as much radio spectrum gaps as possible, the concept of cognitive radio network has been well accepted.

The proposal applies cognitive processes in a cross-layer design, which acquires knowledge from the physical layer, the medium access control (MAC) layer, and application layer.

In this paper, a system that utilizes RS encoding of the information symbols which are then transmitted with MHPSK is evaluated in terms of probability of bit error and spectral efficiency. Using standard RS hard decision decoding, the receiver either correctly decodes the received block or returns a decoding failure. In the event of a decoding failure, soft decision reliability information is used to identify received code symbols with a low probability of being correctly received and to generate new code symbol estimates that are used in the traditional RS decoding algorithm. Because the majority of decoding failures are caused when the total number of code symbol errors exceeds the error correction capability t of the RS code by only a few symbols, only a few code symbols must be corrected in order to successfully decode the received block. The performance of this system is compared to a two-subcarrier OFDM system with either 8-PSK or 8-QAM on each subcarrier and single carrier 8-PSK where the data bits are encoded with the digital video broadcast (DVB) standard rate 0.83 low density parity check (LDPC) code. The MHPSK system with RS encoding and soft decision decoding, the two-subcarrier OFDM system with either 8-QAM or 8-PSK on each subcarrier with LDPC encoding, and single carrier 8-PSK with LDPC encoding are compared in terms of probability of bit error, peak-to-average power ratio, amplifier backoff, and spectral efficiency for very long block lengths.","displayPublicationTitle":"MILCOM 2009 - 2009 IEEE Military Communications Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5368705/5379707/05380034.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","publicationTitle":"MILCOM 2009 - 2009 IEEE Military Communications Conference","doi":"10.1109/MILCOM.2009.5380034","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MILCOM.2009.5380034","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5379707","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5380034","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"M-ary hyper phase-shift keying with Reed Solomon encoding and soft decision reliability information","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Phase shift keying","Reed-Solomon codes","Encoding","Decoding","Parity check codes","Forward error correction","Error correction codes","OFDM","Digital video broadcasting","Robustness"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decoding","error statistics","forward error correction","phase shift keying","Reed-Solomon codes","satellite links"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["M-ary hyper phase-shift keying","Reed Solomon encoding","soft decision reliability","forward error correction coding","soft decision decoding","satellite communications link","bit error probability","spectral efficiency","peak-to-average power ratio","amplifier backoff"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["bandwidth efficiency","orthonormal","phase-shift keying","probability of bit error","forward error correction"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5380034/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 Oct. 2009","displayDocTitle":"M-ary hyper phase-shift keying with Reed Solomon encoding and soft decision reliability information","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5380034/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","accessionNumber":"11085713","dateOfInsertion":"15 January 2010","conferenceDate":"18-21 Oct. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"M-ary hyper phase-shift keying with Reed Solomon encoding and soft decision reliability information","confLoc":"Boston, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"900069.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.079031S","chronDate":"18-21 Oct. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5368705","isNumber":"5379707","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5368705","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5379707","articleId":"5380034","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":5380055,"authors":[{"name":"Richard Framjee","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Texas, Arlington, Arlington, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Richard","lastName":"Framjee","id":"37355064900"},{"name":"Vasant K.

We present methods to evaluate a high data rate DS-SS BPSK reverse link, over a wideband channel, with filters and a modified delayed signature dual finger RAKE. For several years the standard Gaussian approximation has been used to estimate error rate of DS-SS BPSK. We derive simple upper and lower bounds on the conditional error rates. The upper bound is in terms of the error rate obtained with two intersymbol interference terms and bounds on the marginal distribution of the smaller terms. The Gaussian approximation error rate is pessimistic for SNR's greater than 8 dB and 12 dB when compared to that obtained by the total probability theorem and upper bound respectively. Intersymbol interference is not Gaussian and at high front end signal-to-noise ratio's (SNR's) our error rate bound is a better estimate. We have also derived the bandwidth occupancy in a rigorous way for the first time by developing a method to compute the spectral density. The fractional containment bandwidth with two Gold codes is smaller than that with a PN sequence. The spectral density has no discrete lines while it is a function of the signature coefficients and chip Fourier transform. Within the bandwidth the spectral density of a set of frequencies is 15 dB greater than at other frequencies and this set varies from signature to signature. Finally, we show that a modified delayed signature RAKE combats multipath interference. These methods can be used to evaluate a dual space diversity four finger RAKE and to select signatures that minimize adjacent and co-channel interference.","doi":"10.1109/MILCOM.2009.5380055","publicationTitle":"MILCOM 2009 - 2009 IEEE Military Communications Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"MILCOM 2009 - 2009 IEEE Military Communications Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5368705/5379707/05380055.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MILCOM.2009.5380055","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5379707","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Some considerations of DS-SS BPSK spectral density and error rate of a high bit rate rake","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5380055","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 Oct. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5380055/","displayDocTitle":"Some considerations of DS-SS BPSK spectral density and error rate of a high bit rate rake","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","accessionNumber":"11085724","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5380055/","conferenceDate":"18-21 Oct. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"15 January 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Some considerations of DS-SS BPSK spectral density and error rate of a high bit rate rake","confLoc":"Boston, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"900174.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.120631S","chronDate":"18-21 Oct. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5368705","isNumber":"5379707","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5368705","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5379707","articleId":"5380055","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5380056,"authors":[{"name":"Qing Mou","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology, Chengdu, Sichuan, China"],"lastName":"Qing Mou","id":"37678756900"},{"name":"Ping Wei","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology, Chengdu, Sichuan, China"],"lastName":"Ping Wei","id":"37272994200"},{"name":"Heng-Ming Tai","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Tulsa, Tulsa, OK, USA"],"lastName":"Heng-Ming Tai","id":"37273625200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5238-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-5239-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2155-7578"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2155-7586"}],"articleNumber":"5380056","dbTime":"17 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":154},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Quadrature phase shift keying","Testing","Detectors","AWGN","Phase detection","Phase shift keying","Spread spectrum communication","Additive white noise","Upper bound","Statistical analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["AWGN","quadrature phase shift keying","spread spectrum communication","statistical analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["invariant detection problem","quadrature phase-shift keying direct sequence spread spectrum signals","additive white Gaussian noise","complex Gaussian mixture signal model","constant-false-alarm-rate invariant detectors","uniformly-most-powerful-invariant test","generalized likelihood ratio test","asymptotic locally most-powerful invariant test","incoherent weighted multi-cycle detectors","second-order cyclostationary statistics"]}],"abstract":"This paper investigates the invariant detection problem of quadrature phase-shift keying (QPSK) direct sequence spread spectrum (DS-SS) signals in additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN).

The nonlinear distortion introduced by an OFDM signal through practical amplifiers can further degrade the system performance. Due to the limited bandwidth in the radio frequency spectrum, it is impossible that wireless communication systems can operate in an environment which is free from all interference such as narrowband interference (NBI). Hence, it is important to understand how an OFDM system performs when it is subject to NBI interference. In this paper, we analyze the performance of a M-ary quadrature amplitude modulation (M-QAM) OFDM system which is subject to nonlinear high power amplifiers (HPAs) and NBI in a Rayleigh fading channel. In order to reduce the nonlinear distortion caused by HPAs, we propose a new companding technique to reduce the PAPR and a novel receiver structure to minimize the degradation effects from the decompander when the OFDM system operates in Rayleigh fading channel. For the purpose of simulation, we extend the analytical model to be in compliance with the IEEE 802.11n standard. The theoretical results are verified with the simulation.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Effects of narrowband interference and nonlinear amplifier in companded OFDM with application to 802.11n WLAN","publicationTitle":"MILCOM 2009 - 2009 IEEE Military Communications Conference","doi":"10.1109/MILCOM.2009.5380057","displayPublicationTitle":"MILCOM 2009 - 2009 IEEE Military Communications Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5368705/5379707/05380057.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MILCOM.2009.5380057","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5379707","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5380057","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5380057/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 Oct. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Effects of narrowband interference and nonlinear amplifier in companded OFDM with application to 802.11n WLAN","conferenceDate":"18-21 Oct. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5380057/","dateOfInsertion":"15 January 2010","publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","accessionNumber":"11104367","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Effects of narrowband interference and nonlinear amplifier in companded OFDM with application to 802.11n WLAN","confLoc":"Boston, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"900211.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.095927S","chronDate":"18-21 Oct. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5368705","isNumber":"5379707","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5368705","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5379707","articleId":"5380057","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5380058,"authors":[{"name":"Apurva N.

Security in cognitive radio networks (CRN) is even more challenging. This is because a CRN consists of cognitive radios (CR) which have many more functions and processes to account for, such as sensing, geolocation, spectrum management, access to the policy database etc. Each of these functions and processes need to be assessed for potential vulnerabilities and security mechanisms need to be provided for protection of not just the secondary users of the spectrum but also the primary users or the incumbents. This paper discusses the potential security vulnerabilities and the remediations for the same in a CRN with an example using a commercial IEEE 802.22 standard. Due to the unique characteristics of the CRs in a CRN, enhanced security mechanisms are required. The security mechanisms in CRN are divided into several security sub-layers which protect non-cognitive as well as cognitive functions of the system and the interactions between the two. This paper describes these security features as incorporated into the IEEE 802.22 standard. It is possible to apply similar security mechanisms for a military CRN.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 Oct. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5380058/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"11102069","publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","conferenceDate":"18-21 Oct. 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5380058/","dateOfInsertion":"15 January 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Security in cognitive radio networks: An example using the commercial IEEE 802.22 standard","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Security in cognitive radio networks: An example using the commercial IEEE 802.22 standard","confLoc":"Boston, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"900186.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054766S","chronDate":"18-21 Oct. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5368705","isNumber":"5379707","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5368705","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"5379707","articleId":"5380058","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-28"},{"_id":5380060,"authors":[{"name":"Benjamin Hamilton","affiliation":["Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"firstName":"Benjamin","lastName":"Hamilton","id":"37602510000"},{"name":"Xiaoli Ma","affiliation":["Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"lastName":"Xiaoli Ma","id":"37279528400"},{"name":"John Kleider","affiliation":["General Dynamics C4 Systems, Scottsdale, AZ, USA"],"firstName":"John","lastName":"Kleider","id":"37281695200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5238-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-5239-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2155-7578"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2155-7586"}],"articleNumber":"5380060","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":210},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Channel estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","distortion","mean square error methods","OFDM modulation","power amplifiers","spectral analysis","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["OFDM channel estimation performance","peak power constraint","OFDM signals","power amplifiers","OFDM systems","null edge subcarriers","spectral shaping","Crame\u00bfr-Rao bound","peak limitation","channel estimation mean-squared error","data symbol mean-squared error","distorted signals"]}],"abstract":"OFDM signals suffer significant distortion when transmitted through practical power amplifiers.

Nevertheless, the elimination of ISI in the MC-CDMA communications systems is at the cost of significant loss in bandwidth efficiency. Additionally, due to the time varying nature of the multipath channel, the training sequence needs to be transmitted periodically, causing further loss of channel throughput. Therefore, blind channel estimation methods which avoid the use of training sequence or even the CP are more attractive due to the increasing demand for high-bit-rate transmission. In this paper, a blind linear prediction based multiuser detection method which avoids the use of CP is proposed for MC-CDMA communications systems. Compared with some existing blind methods, our newly proposed method has better performance. Computer simulations are presented to verify its effectiveness.","doi":"10.1109/MILCOM.2009.5380066","publicationTitle":"MILCOM 2009 - 2009 IEEE Military Communications Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"MILCOM 2009 - 2009 IEEE Military Communications Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5368705/5379707/05380066.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MILCOM.2009.5380066","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5379707","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Linear prediction based multiuser detection for multicarrier CDMA communications systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5380066","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Linear prediction based multiuser detection for multicarrier CDMA communications systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 Oct. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5380066/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"18-21 Oct. 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","accessionNumber":"11104370","dateOfInsertion":"15 January 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5380066/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Linear prediction based multiuser detection for multicarrier CDMA communications systems","confLoc":"Boston, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"900216.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.106895S","chronDate":"18-21 Oct. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5368705","isNumber":"5379707","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5368705","xplore-issue":"5379707","articleId":"5380066","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5380067,"authors":[{"name":"Daniel Pack","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, US Air Force Academy, CO, USA"],"firstName":"Daniel","lastName":"Pack","id":"37273806100"},{"name":"Glen Dudevoir","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, US Air Force Academy, CO, USA"],"firstName":"Glen","lastName":"Dudevoir","id":"37449325200"},{"name":"Pedro Lima","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, US Air Force Academy, CO, USA"],"firstName":"Pedro","lastName":"Lima","id":"37267147500"},{"name":"Scott Gruber","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, US Air Force Academy, CO, USA"],"firstName":"Scott","lastName":"Gruber","id":"37679455800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5238-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-5239-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2155-7578"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2155-7586"}],"articleNumber":"5380067","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":155},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Unmanned aerial vehicles","Cooperative systems","Automotive engineering","Biomedical engineering","Maintenance engineering","Reliability engineering","Resource management","Medical control systems","Communication system control","Control systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["aerospace robotics","cooperative systems","military aircraft","mobile robots","multi-robot systems","reliability","remotely operated vehicles"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiple unmanned aerial vehicle","resource allocation","control optimization","communication reliability","collective target search","cooperative unmanned aerial system"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["cooperative control","communication network"]}],"abstract":"The emerging technologies of multiple, cooperative unmanned systems have brought in an exciting period of possibilities, possibilities of solving challenging problems in medical, social, engineering, and military communities.

The algorithm is carefully mapped into a limited dynamic range, and scaled through each function in the datapath. This requires numerous rounding and saturation steps, and can adversely affect the algorithm performance. Use of floating-point arithmetic provides a large dynamic range and greatly simplifies the task of system performance verification, usually against a floating-point simulation. The drawback is an order of magnitude larger computational requirement, whether using a digital signal processor or FPGA-based simplification. Recently available FPGA design tools and IP provide a substantial reduction in computational resources, as well as greatly easing the implementation effort in a floating-point datapath. Moreover, unlike digital signal processors, an FPGA can support a DSP datapath with mixed floating- and fixed-point operations, and achieve performance in excess of 100 GFLOPS. This is an important advantage, for many high-performance radar, electronic warfare, and sensor fusion applications only require the dynamic-range floating-point arithmetic in a subset of the total signal processing. The choice of FPGA implementation coupled with floating-point tools and IP allows the designer flexibility in a mix of fixed-point data width, floating-point data precision, and performance levels unattainable by a processor-based architecture.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Field programmable gate arrays","Digital signal processing","Signal processing algorithms","Dynamic range","Floating-point arithmetic","Digital signal processors","Radar signal processing","Digital arithmetic","Fixed-point arithmetic","System performance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electronic warfare","field programmable gate arrays","floating point arithmetic","radar","sensor fusion","signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FPGA based simplification","digital signal processing","fixed point arithmetic","integer arithmetic","system performance verification","computational resources","floating point datapath","high performance radar","electronic warfare","sensor fusion applications","processor based architecture","high performance floating point arithmetic","DSP datapath"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5380072","doi":"10.1109/MILCOM.2009.5380072","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","publicationTitle":"MILCOM 2009 - 2009 IEEE Military Communications Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"MILCOM 2009 - 2009 IEEE Military Communications Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5368705/5379707/05380072.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5379707","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MILCOM.2009.5380072","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5380072/","displayDocTitle":"High-performance floating-point implementation using FPGAS","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 Oct. 2009","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"15 January 2010","accessionNumber":"11102072","htmlLink":"/document/5380072/","conferenceDate":"18-21 Oct. 2009","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High-performance floating-point implementation using FPGAS","confLoc":"Boston, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"900220.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.025987S","chronDate":"18-21 Oct. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5368705","isNumber":"5379707","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5368705","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"5379707","articleId":"5380072","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5380078,"authors":[{"name":"Benjamin Hilburn","affiliation":["State University, Virginia Polytechnic Institute, Blacksburg, VA, USA"],"firstName":"Benjamin","lastName":"Hilburn","id":"37682622100"},{"name":"Timothy R.

Policies that implement radio regulations are written in a policy language, and used by the policy engine to approve or deny transmission parameters. Since decision speed is one of the primary design requirements of cognitive radios, policy engines and reasoners can easily bottleneck the radio's operation. In this paper, we propose a policy generation and enforcement model for policy-managed cognitive radio systems designed with speed as its top priority. The model is based on the idea of splitting a resource into minimum-sized usable sectors. Policy is preprocessed and compiled for each of the sectors, thus creating a single static policy for each sector of the resource. This model drastically decreases runtime policy comparisons, thus speeding up the policy engine's operation. Another effect of this design is a simplified policy language model. We discuss design considerations and challenges for policy languages and policy engines, ways in which a slow policy engine can bottleneck a cognitive radio's operation, and assert that operational speed should be the top design priority when considering policy engines and reasoners. In addition, we analyze the on-disk storage required by this model, and suggest possible optimizations.","doi":"10.1109/MILCOM.2009.5380078","displayPublicationTitle":"MILCOM 2009 - 2009 IEEE Military Communications Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5368705/5379707/05380078.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5379707","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MILCOM.2009.5380078","publicationTitle":"MILCOM 2009 - 2009 IEEE Military Communications Conference","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sector-based policy generation and enforcement for cognitive radios","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5380078","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 Oct. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Sector-based policy generation and enforcement for cognitive radios","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5380078/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5380078/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","accessionNumber":"11104374","dateOfInsertion":"15 January 2010","conferenceDate":"18-21 Oct. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sector-based policy generation and enforcement for cognitive radios","confLoc":"Boston, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"900269.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063371S","chronDate":"18-21 Oct. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5368705","isNumber":"5379707","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5368705","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5379707","articleId":"5380078","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5380081,"authors":[{"name":"Brooke Shrader","affiliation":["Lincoln Laboratory, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Lexington, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Brooke","lastName":"Shrader","id":"37300947000"},{"name":"Nathaniel M.

While a number of hardware-based mitigation techniques have been proposed in the literature and deployed in experimental systems (e.g., aperture averaging, wavelength diversity, etc.), novel baseband signal processing approaches have the potential to complement - or even supplant - these traditional methods at a much lower cost and with minimal size, weight, and power impact. This paper presents a digital baseband approach to scintillation mitigation that employs multiple stop-and-wait incremental redundancy (IR) hybrid automatic repeat request (HARQ) processes. The proposed IR retransmission scheme provides a bandwidth efficient means of capturing the time diversity that is required to combat millisecond long fades at baseband.

An exchange of messages begins with both terminals transmitting binary data sequences simultaneously to the relay. The relay determines the modulo-2 sum of the sequences, which it modulates and broadcasts to the terminals. Since each terminal knows the information it transmitted, it can determine the information transmitted by the other terminal by subtracting its own information from the broadcast signal. Prior work on the topic of physical-layer network coding has assumed that the signals transmitted by the two terminals arrive at the relay with perfectly aligned phases, permitting coherent reception. In this paper, we relax the assumption of aligned phases and consider noncoherent reception of binary continuous-phase frequency-shift keying signals. A derivation of the relay receiver is given for varying amounts of channel state information, and results are provided showing the error performance of the proposed system without an outer error-correcting code and with an outer turbo code.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Noncoherent physical-layer network coding using binary CPFSK modulation","publicationTitle":"MILCOM 2009 - 2009 IEEE Military Communications Conference","doi":"10.1109/MILCOM.2009.5380101","displayPublicationTitle":"MILCOM 2009 - 2009 IEEE Military Communications Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5368705/5379707/05380101.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MILCOM.2009.5380101","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5379707","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5380101","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5380101/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 Oct. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Noncoherent physical-layer network coding using binary CPFSK modulation","conferenceDate":"18-21 Oct. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5380101/","dateOfInsertion":"15 January 2010","publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","accessionNumber":"11104385","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Noncoherent physical-layer network coding using binary CPFSK modulation","confLoc":"Boston, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"900392.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062774S","chronDate":"18-21 Oct. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5368705","isNumber":"5379707","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5368705","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"5379707","articleId":"5380101","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5380105,"authors":[{"name":"Tore Ulvers\u00f8y","affiliation":["University of Oslo, Oslo, Norway","Forsvarets Forskningsinstitutt, University Studies at Kjeller, Kjeller, Norway"],"firstName":"Tore","lastName":"Ulvers\u00f8y","id":"37403115700"},{"name":"Torleiv Maseng","affiliation":["University of Oslo, Oslo, Norway","Forsvarets Forskningsinstitutt, University Studies at Kjeller, Kjeller, Norway"],"firstName":"Torleiv","lastName":"Maseng","id":"37350038100"},{"name":"Toan Hoang","affiliation":["University of Oslo, Oslo, Norway","Forsvarets Forskningsinstitutt, University Studies at Kjeller, Kjeller, Norway"],"firstName":"Toan","lastName":"Hoang","id":"37672132900"},{"name":"J\u00f8rn K\u00e5rstad","affiliation":["Forsvarets forskningsinstitutt (FFI), Kjeller, Norway"],"firstName":"J\u00f8rn","lastName":"K\u00e5rstad","id":"38243217800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5238-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-5239-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2155-7578"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2155-7586"}],"articleNumber":"5380105","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":106},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Peer to peer computing","Interference","Vehicle dynamics","Frequency","Computational complexity","Military communication","Military computing","TV","Command and control systems","Chromium"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["communication complexity","decision making","military communication","military computing","network servers","peer-to-peer computing","radio spectrum management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["centralized dynamic spectrum access","peer-to-peer dynamic spectrum access","autonomous dynamic spectrum access","tactical scenario","autonomous decision making","peer-to-peer constellations","centralized spectrum server concepts","broker hierarchy","spectrum decisions","computational complexity","radio nodes","spectrum coordination traffic","military deployable communications systems"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5380105","doi":"10.1109/MILCOM.2009.5380105","publicationTitle":"MILCOM 2009 - 2009 IEEE Military Communications Conference","abstract":"Several concepts for more dynamic spectrum access have been suggested: 1. terminals making autonomous decisions without coordination 2.

Most of the existing association rule mining algorithms make repeated passes over the entire database to determine the frequent itemsets, which is likely to incur an extremely high I/O overhead. A simple but an effective way to overcome this problem is to sample the database, such that, it produces rules with highest achievable accuracy on the large database. Numerous researchers have proposed sampling approaches for faster and efficient mining of association rules. In this paper, we propose a novel and effective progressive sampling-based approach for mining association rules from a large database. Initially, the frequent patterns are extracted using Apriori algorithm from an initial sample that is selected based on the temporal characteristics and the size of the database. Using the frequent itemsets generated, the negative border of the initial sample is obtained and sorted. Subsequently, the midpoint itemset in the sorted negative border is scanned in the concrete database to check if it is frequent. Based on the support level computed for the midpoint itemset, the sample size is either progressively increased for determining an optimal sample or association rules are mined by considering it as an optimal sample. The experimental results demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed progressive sampling approach in effective mining of association rules.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5380155","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCEE.2009.211","publicationTitle":"2009 Second International Conference on Computer and Electrical Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Second International Conference on Computer and Electrical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/5379502/5380155/05380173.pdf","startPage":"610","endPage":"614","doi":"10.1109/ICCEE.2009.211","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Developing Novel and Effective Approach for Association Rule Mining Using Progressive Sampling","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-30 Dec. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Developing Novel and Effective Approach for Association Rule Mining Using Progressive Sampling","isConference":true,"volume":"1","conferenceDate":"28-30 Dec. 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5380173/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","accessionNumber":"11072876","dateOfInsertion":"15 January 2010","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5380173/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Developing Novel and Effective Approach for Association Rule Mining Using Progressive Sampling","confLoc":"Dubai, United Arab Emirates","sourcePdf":"3925a610.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065644S","chronDate":"28-30 Dec. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5379502","isNumber":"5380155","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5379502","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"5380155","articleId":"5380173","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5380183,"authors":[{"name":"Mohsen Lashkargir","affiliation":["Department of Computer Engineering, Islamic Azad University, Yazd, Iran"],"firstName":"Mohsen","lastName":"Lashkargir","id":"38559691100"},{"name":"S.

Biclustering is a very useful data mining technique for discovering genes which have similar behavior. In microarray data, several objectives have to be optimized simultaneously and often these objectives are in conflict with each other. A multi objective model is very suitable for solving this problem. Our method proposes a Hybrid algorithm which is based on adaptive multi objective particle swarm optimization for discovering biclusters in gene expression data. In our method, we will consider a low level of overlapping among biclusters and as possible, will cover all elements of gene expression matrix.

Simulation comparisons for typical test functions show that the proposed algorithm can effectively solve the multi-objective optimization. We use the proposed algorithm to optimize two goals of used bandwidth and power consumption for cognitive networks. And then the fuzzy algorithm is used to select the best configuration parameters of bandwidth and power from a set of optimal solutions. Simulation results show that the algorithm can effectively address the spectrum allocation and power control in cognitive radio networks.","doi":"10.1109/DASC.2009.84","pdfPath":"/iel5/5379503/5380134/05380427.pdf","startPage":"379","endPage":"383","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Eighth IEEE International Conference on Dependable, Autonomic and Secure Computing","publicationTitle":"2009 Eighth IEEE International Conference on Dependable, Autonomic and Secure Computing","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DASC.2009.84","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5380134","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multi-objective Optimization of Cross-Layer Configuration for Cognitive Wireless Network","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5380427/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 Dec. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Multi-objective Optimization of Cross-Layer Configuration for Cognitive Wireless Network","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"15 January 2010","accessionNumber":"11073081","publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5380427/","conferenceDate":"12-14 Dec. 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multi-objective Optimization of Cross-Layer Configuration for Cognitive Wireless Network","confLoc":"Chengdu, China","sourcePdf":"3929a379.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060613S","chronDate":"12-14 Dec. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5379503","isNumber":"5380134","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5379503","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5380134","articleId":"5380427","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":5380436,"authors":[{"name":"Hong Xia","affiliation":["Institute of Computer System Architecture and Network, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Hong","lastName":"Xia","id":"37406051600"},{"name":"Yan Chen","affiliation":["Institute of Computer System Architecture and Network, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Yan","lastName":"Chen","id":"37089071813"},{"name":"Zengzhi Li","affiliation":["Institute of Computer System Architecture and Network, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Zengzhi","lastName":"Li","id":"37279078600"},{"name":"Haichang Gao","affiliation":["Software Engineering Institute, Xidian University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Haichang","lastName":"Gao","id":"37403290600"},{"name":"Yanping Chen","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Technology, Xi'an Institute of Post and Telecommunications, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Yanping","lastName":"Chen","id":"37407067400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5421-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5420-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3929-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5380436","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":13,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":247},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5380436","abstract":"A novel multi-objective optimization based particle swarm optimization algorithm is presented to solve the global optimization problem for based services selecting in Web services composition technology.

This is achieved by applying a newly proposed differential circuit (the second derivatives of transconductance) cancellation technique, called the differential multiple gated transistor (DMGTR). In the DMGTR amplifier, linearity is improved by using transconductance linearization which can be achieved by canceling the negative peak value of the main transistor with the positive one in the auxiliary transistor having a different size and gate drive combined in parallel which is properly sized and biased. This enhancement, however, is limited by the distortion originated from the combined influence of and harmonic feedback, which can greatly be reduced by the cascoding MGTR output for the amplifier. By adopting the DMGTR, a low-power highly linear RF PGA is implemented.

A simple way to solve such problems is by depth first search (DFS) algorithm which has a big search space even for quite small problems. In this paper we proposed a solution to this problem with genetic algorithm and then optimized it by using parallelism. We also showed that the algorithm reaches a solution faster and in a smaller number of iterations than similar algorithms.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Genetic algorithms","Arithmetic","Concurrent computing","Biological cells","Genetic mutations","Genetic engineering","Parallel processing","Electronics packaging","Mathematics","Performance gain"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithms","parallel algorithms","problem solving","tree searching"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cryptarithmetic problems","parallel genetic algorithm","constraint satisfaction problems","arithmetic operations","depth first search algorithm","iterations"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["constraint satisfaction","cryptarithmetic","parallel genetic algorithm"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5380487","doi":"10.1109/ICCEE.2009.25","startPage":"308","endPage":"312","publicationTitle":"2009 Second International Conference on Computer and Electrical Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Second International Conference on Computer and Electrical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/5379502/5380155/05380487.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5380155","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCEE.2009.25","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5380487/","displayDocTitle":"Solving Cryptarithmetic Problems Using Parallel Genetic Algorithm","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"28-30 Dec. 2009","volume":"1","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"15 January 2010","accessionNumber":"11072942","htmlLink":"/document/5380487/","conferenceDate":"28-30 Dec. 2009","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Solving Cryptarithmetic Problems Using Parallel Genetic Algorithm","confLoc":"Dubai, United Arab Emirates","sourcePdf":"3925a308.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.038747S","chronDate":"28-30 Dec. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5379502","isNumber":"5380155","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5379502","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"5380155","articleId":"5380487","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5380531,"authors":[{"name":"Hamed Mehrara","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, Iran Center of Electronic, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Hamed","lastName":"Mehrara","id":"37671821300"},{"name":"Mohammad Zahedinejad","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, Iran Center of Electronic, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Mohammad","lastName":"Zahedinejad","id":"37089047528"},{"name":"Ali Pourmohammad","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, Amirkabir University of Technology\uc2a0, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Ali","lastName":"Pourmohammad","id":"37541418400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5365-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-3925-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5380531","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":10,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":405},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5380531","abstract":"One of the most fundamental features of digital image and the basic steps in image processing, analysis, pattern recognition and computer vision is the edge of image where the preciseness and reliability of its results will affect directly the comprehension machine system made for objective world.

A total of four performance measures are adopted, and they describe different kinds of metamodel performance, such as ability to provide good starting points for gradient-based search, accuracy of placing optima in the correct location and so on. With the help of the four measures, the performance of the two metamodeling methods is evaluated through the examination of two 2-D test functions. Both test functions have multiple local optima over the design space, and they are representative of the modeling challenges typically encountered in realistic simulation optimization problems. In the process of performance comparison, different empirical formulas are used to set the number of neurons in the hidden layer, while diverse correlation functions are adopted to create different kinds of Kriging metamodels. Preliminary research results reveal that Kriging approximation is in general likely to be preferred.","doi":"10.1109/DASC.2009.46","startPage":"815","endPage":"821","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Eighth IEEE International Conference on Dependable, Autonomic and Secure Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5379503/5380134/05380596.pdf","publicationTitle":"2009 Eighth IEEE International Conference on Dependable, Autonomic and Secure Computing","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DASC.2009.46","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5380134","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Comparison of Neural Network and Kriging Method for Creating Simulation-Optimization Metamodels","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Computational modeling","Metamodeling","Testing","Optimization methods","Design optimization","Context modeling","Extraterrestrial measurements","Polynomials","Computer networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["gradient methods","meta data","neural nets","optimisation","statistical analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neural network","Kriging method","simulation optimization metamodels","gradient based search","optima placing","2D test functions","hidden layer","correlation functions"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["simulation optimization","Kriging approximation","neural network","metamodel performance"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5380596/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 Dec. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Comparison of Neural Network and Kriging Method for Creating Simulation-Optimization Metamodels","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5380596/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"15 January 2010","conferenceDate":"12-14 Dec. 2009","accessionNumber":"11073114","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Comparison of Neural Network and Kriging Method for Creating Simulation-Optimization Metamodels","confLoc":"Chengdu, China","sourcePdf":"3929a815.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.040207S","chronDate":"12-14 Dec. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5379503","isNumber":"5380134","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5379503","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"5380134","articleId":"5380596","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5380611,"authors":[{"name":"Sebastian Roschke","affiliation":["Hasso Plattner Institute (HPI), University of Potsdam, Potsdam, Germany"],"firstName":"Sebastian","lastName":"Roschke","id":"37547023300"},{"name":"Feng Cheng","affiliation":["Hasso Plattner Institute (HPI), University of Potsdam, Potsdam, Germany"],"firstName":"Feng","lastName":"Cheng","id":"37591502700"},{"name":"Christoph Meinel","affiliation":["Hasso Plattner Institute (HPI), University of Potsdam, Potsdam, Germany"],"firstName":"Christoph","lastName":"Meinel","id":"37268306500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5421-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5420-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3929-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5380611","dbTime":"28 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":53,"citationCountPatent":8,"totalDownloads":3322},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Intrusion detection","Cloud computing","Application software","Computer architecture","Virtual machining","Network servers","Protection","Robustness","Monitoring","Computer networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Internet","security of data"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["intrusion detection system","network communication","IDS management","distributed IDS solutions","distributed environment","cloud computing","virtualization-based context compatibility","cloud providers","distributed cloud infrastructure"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["IDS","IDS Management","Cloud Computing","Virtualization","Virtual Machine"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Intrusion Detection in the Cloud","doi":"10.1109/DASC.2009.94","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5380134","endPage":"734","publicationTitle":"2009 Eighth IEEE International Conference on Dependable, Autonomic and Secure Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Eighth IEEE International Conference on Dependable, Autonomic and Secure Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5379503/5380134/05380611.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DASC.2009.94","startPage":"729","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5380611","abstract":"Intrusion detection systems (IDS) have been used widely to detect malicious behaviors in network communication and hosts. IDS management is an important capability for distributed IDS solutions, which makes it possible to integrate and handle different types of sensors or collect and synthesize alerts generated from multiple hosts located in the distributed environment. Facing new application scenarios in cloud computing, the IDS approaches yield several problems since the operator of the IDS should be the user, not the administrator of the cloud infrastructure. Extensibility, efficient management, and compatibility to virtualization-based context need to be introduced into many existing IDS implementations.Additionally, the cloud providers need to enable possibilities to deploy and configure IDS for the user. Within this paper, we summarize several requirements for deploying IDS in the cloud and propose an extensible IDS architecture for being easily used in a distributed cloud infrastructure.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5380611/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 Dec. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"15 January 2010","accessionNumber":"11073129","htmlLink":"/document/5380611/","conferenceDate":"12-14 Dec. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Intrusion Detection in the Cloud","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Intrusion Detection in the Cloud","confLoc":"Chengdu, China","sourcePdf":"3929a729.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052574S","chronDate":"12-14 Dec. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5379503","isNumber":"5380134","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5379503","citationCount":"53","xplore-issue":"5380134","articleId":"5380611","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5380612,"authors":[{"name":"Ji Hu","affiliation":["SAP Research Center Karlsruhe, Germany"],"firstName":"Ji","lastName":"Hu","id":"37536384600"},{"name":"Andreas Klein","affiliation":["SAP Research Center Karlsruhe, Germany"],"firstName":"Andreas","lastName":"Klein","id":"37669442200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5421-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5420-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3929-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5380612","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":19,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":911},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cryptography","Cloud computing","Application software","Data security","Costs","Intrusion detection","Web services","Data privacy","Electronic commerce","Protection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cryptography","data privacy","electronic commerce","Internet"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["transparent data encryption approach","cloud computing","IT infrastructure","enterprise data","storage service providers","data security","e-commerce security","Web application"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cloud Computing","Encryption","Benchmark"]}],"abstract":"Cloud computing is a new computing style which provides IT infrastructure and software as dynamic, scalable, and pay-per-use services.

In this paper we analyze privacy requirements for the cloud applications and discuss data encryption approaches for securing e-commerce applications in the cloud. To provide quantitative estimation of performance penalties caused by data encryption, we made a benchmark for an online marketplace application as a case study. Lessons learned from the benchmark are also discussed in the paper to provide some recommendations for avoiding unnecessary encryption costs.","doi":"10.1109/DASC.2009.85","publicationTitle":"2009 Eighth IEEE International Conference on Dependable, Autonomic and Secure Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Eighth IEEE International Conference on Dependable, Autonomic and Secure Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5379503/5380134/05380612.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DASC.2009.85","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5380134","startPage":"735","endPage":"740","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Benchmark of Transparent Data Encryption for Migration of Web Applications in the Cloud","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5380612","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A Benchmark of Transparent Data Encryption for Migration of Web Applications in the Cloud","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 Dec. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5380612/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"12-14 Dec. 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","accessionNumber":"11073130","dateOfInsertion":"15 January 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5380612/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Benchmark of Transparent Data Encryption for Migration of Web Applications in the Cloud","confLoc":"Chengdu, China","sourcePdf":"3929a735.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055701S","chronDate":"12-14 Dec. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5379503","isNumber":"5380134","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5379503","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"5380134","articleId":"5380612","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5380613,"authors":[{"name":"Kai Hwang","affiliation":["University of Southern California, Los Angeles, USA"],"firstName":"Kai","lastName":"Hwang","id":"37278134200"},{"name":"Sameer Kulkareni","affiliation":["University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, US"],"firstName":"Sameer","lastName":"Kulkareni"},{"name":"Yue Hu","affiliation":["University of Science and Technology, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yue","lastName":"Hu","id":"38546410500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5421-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5420-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3929-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5380613","dbTime":"16 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":66,"citationCountPatent":10,"totalDownloads":3604},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Data security","Cloud computing","Application software","Protection","Web and internet services","Costs","Conference management","USA Councils","Production facilities","Data privacy"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer centres","data privacy","information retrieval","Internet","peer-to-peer computing","search engines","virtual reality"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud security","reputation-based trust management","Internet clouds","Web-scale data centers","elastic cloud resources","copyright","cyber attacks","virtual clusters","security-reinforced data centers","P2P reputation systems","cloud service model protection","data object level","file access level"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Internet clouds","data centers","network security","virtualization","reputation system","and cloud computing services"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5380613","doi":"10.1109/DASC.2009.149","publicationTitle":"2009 Eighth IEEE International Conference on Dependable, Autonomic and Secure Computing","abstract":"Internet clouds work as service factories built around Web-scale data centers.

Statistical collocation was used to determine strength of word co-occurrences. Probabilities of POS sequences were used to adjust the strength of collocation within a possible compound. These probabilities were estimated from compounds found in the dictionary. Bigram and trigram words extracted from a corpus of 28 million words were ranked by two means, collocation scores and collocation scores weighted by POS pattern probabilities. Cutoff precision at every 200 points were calculated for both methods. The results showed that probabilities of POS sequences could increase the precision rate of compound extraction at certain level. The system can extract 2-word compounds and 3-word compounds at the precision rate up to 63% and 35% respectively. When eliminating bigram extractions that could be parts of trigram extraction, the precision rate is increased up to 71%.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Asian Language Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5379504/5380723/05380782.pdf","startPage":"118","endPage":"122","publicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Asian Language Processing","doi":"10.1109/IALP.2009.33","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IALP.2009.33","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5380723","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5380782","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Extracting Thai Compounds Using Collocations and POS Bigram Probabilities without a POS Tagger","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Dictionaries","Data mining","Probability","Natural languages","Statistical analysis","Morphology","Filters","Speech processing","Mutual information","Frequency"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["grammars","linguistics","natural language processing","probability","statistical analysis","word processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Thai","statistical collocations","POS bigram probabilities","word co-occurrences strength","POS sequences","bigram word","trigram word","bigram extractions","trigram extraction","compounds extraction","part-of-speech"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["compound extraction","collocation","Thai"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5380782/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-9 Dec. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Extracting Thai Compounds Using Collocations and POS Bigram Probabilities without a POS Tagger","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5380782/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","accessionNumber":"11073201","dateOfInsertion":"15 January 2010","conferenceDate":"7-9 Dec. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Extracting Thai Compounds Using Collocations and POS Bigram Probabilities without a POS Tagger","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"3904a118.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.0467S","chronDate":"7-9 Dec. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5379504","isNumber":"5380723","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5379504","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5380723","articleId":"5380782","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5380795,"authors":[{"name":"Oanh Thi Tran","affiliation":["Information Systems Department College of Technology, VNUH, Hanoi, Vietnam"],"firstName":"Oanh Thi","lastName":"Tran","id":"37670925700"},{"name":"Cuong Anh Le","affiliation":["Computer Science Department College of Technology, VNUH, Hanoi, Vietnam"],"firstName":"Cuong Anh","lastName":"Le","id":"37673775700"},{"name":"Thuy Quang Ha","affiliation":["Information Systems Department College of Technology, VNUH, Hanoi, Vietnam"],"firstName":"Thuy Quang","lastName":"Ha","id":"37666507800"},{"name":"Quynh Hoang Le","affiliation":["Information Systems Department College of Technology, VNUH, Hanoi, Vietnam"],"firstName":"Quynh Hoang","lastName":"Le","id":"37672263300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5318-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3904-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5380795","dbTime":"16 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":154},"abstract":"In Natural Language Processing (NLP), Part-of-speech tagging is one of the important tasks.

Motivated from Chinese research and Vietnamese characteristics, we present a new kind of features based on the idea of word composition. We call it morpheme based features. To verify the effectiveness of these features, we use three powerful machine learning techniques - MEM, CRF and SVM. In addition, we also built a Vietnamese POS-tagged corpus with approximately 8000 sentences of different genres to conduct experiments. Experimental results showed that morpheme-based features always give higher precision in comparison with previous approaches - usually word-based features. We achieved the precision of 91.64% by using these morpheme-based features.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Asian Language Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5379504/5380723/05380795.pdf","startPage":"23","endPage":"27","publicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Asian Language Processing","doi":"10.1109/IALP.2009.14","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IALP.2009.14","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5380723","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5380795","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Experimental Study on Vietnamese POS Tagging","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Tagging","Natural languages","Learning systems","Hidden Markov models","Educational institutions","Support vector machines","Entropy","Buildings","Computer science","Information systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["learning (artificial intelligence)","linguistics","natural language processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Vietnamese POS tagging","natural language processing","part-of-speech tagging","morpheme based features","machine learning techniques"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Vietnamese POS tagging","morpheme-based features","word-based features","Vietnamese POS-tagged corpus"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5380795/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-9 Dec. 2009","displayDocTitle":"An Experimental Study on Vietnamese POS Tagging","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5380795/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","accessionNumber":"11073214","dateOfInsertion":"15 January 2010","conferenceDate":"7-9 Dec. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Experimental Study on Vietnamese POS Tagging","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"3904a023.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054417S","chronDate":"7-9 Dec. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5379504","isNumber":"5380723","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5379504","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"5380723","articleId":"5380795","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5380850,"authors":[{"name":"Jaliya Ekanayake","affiliation":["School of Informatics and Computing, Indiana University Bloomington, USA"],"firstName":"Jaliya","lastName":"Ekanayake","id":"37591577300"},{"name":"Thilina Gunarathne","affiliation":["School of Informatics and Computing, Indiana University Bloomington, USA"],"firstName":"Thilina","lastName":"Gunarathne","id":"37595053900"},{"name":"Geoffrey Fox","affiliation":["School of Informatics and Computing, Pervasive Technology Institute, Indiana University Bloomington, USA"],"firstName":"Geoffrey","lastName":"Fox","id":"37268873900"},{"name":"Atilla Soner Balkir","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Chicago, USA"],"firstName":"Atilla Soner","lastName":"Balkir","id":"37671019100"},{"name":"Christophe Poulain","affiliation":["Microsoft Research Limited, USA"],"firstName":"Christophe","lastName":"Poulain","id":"37393311800"},{"name":"Nelson Araujo","affiliation":["Microsoft Research Limited, USA"],"firstName":"Nelson","lastName":"Araujo","id":"37660846600"},{"name":"Roger Barga","affiliation":["Microsoft Research Limited, USA"],"firstName":"Roger","lastName":"Barga","id":"37283138600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5340-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3877-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5380850","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":20,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":209},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Pipelines","USA Councils","Hardware","Conference management","Astronomy","Resilience","Fault tolerant systems","Monitoring","Physics computing","Availability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data analysis","natural sciences computing","parallel programming"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["DryadLINQ","scientific analyses","high level parallel runtimes","MapReduce programming model","open source MapReduce runtimes","Hadoop","Microsoft","academic use","scientific data analysis applications"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cloud Computing","MapReduce","DryadLINQ","Hadoop"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5380850","abstract":"Applying high level parallel runtimes to data/compute intensive applications is becoming increasingly common.

Compared with traditional schemes, key management with optimization has much superiority in security and efficiency for hardware and software application.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5381004/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-14 Dec. 2009","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"13-14 Dec. 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5381004/","dateOfInsertion":"15 January 2010","publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","accessionNumber":"11084807","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Bionic Optimized Key Management Scheme Based on Elliptic Curves Cryptosystem","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Bionic Optimized Key Management Scheme Based on Elliptic Curves Cryptosystem","confLoc":"Sanya, China","sourcePdf":"3880a369.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053109S","chronDate":"13-14 Dec. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5379694","isNumber":"5380897","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5379694","xplore-issue":"5380897","articleId":"5381004","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5381026,"authors":[{"name":"Chengzhang Wang","affiliation":["Applied Mathematic College, Central University of Finance and Economics, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Chengzhang","lastName":"Wang","id":"37538391400"},{"name":"Xiaoming Bai","affiliation":["Information College, Capital University of Economics and Business, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Xiaoming","lastName":"Bai","id":"37533166800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5339-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5381026","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":103},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Face recognition","Facial features","Image recognition","Educational institutions","Principal component analysis","Information technology","Conference management","Financial management","Information management","Technology management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["block codes","face recognition","image coding","image colour analysis","matrix decomposition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["color face recognition","revised NMF algorithm","color face image","grey scale image","block diagonal nonnegative matrix factorization","color face representation","block diagonal matrix","color information encoding","block diagonal constraint","facial feature extraction","nearest neighborhood classifier","CVL","CMU PIE color face databases"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["face recognition","block diagonal matrix","NMF"]}],"abstract":"Color face image is composed of color information of different channels.

Because negotiations commonly are multi-lateral and multi-issue, these processes become more difficult. In the real world applications this becomes more important where the autonomous agents involved in a negotiation should reach maximum payoff in minimum time. In this work a new negotiation mechanism is proposed that is based on the multi-objective genetic algorithms. Several measures are defined that can show fitness of an offer in the set of feasible offers that an agent can have in each round of negotiations. The results show that this method can be used in real applications and is competitive with existing approaches.","doi":"10.1109/FITME.2009.154","pdfPath":"/iel5/5379694/5380897/05381059.pdf","startPage":"596","endPage":"599","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Second International Conference on Future Information Technology and Management Engineering","publicationTitle":"2009 Second International Conference on Future Information Technology and Management Engineering","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FITME.2009.154","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5380897","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Multi-objective Genetic Algorithm Method to Support Multi-agent Negotiations","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5381059/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-14 Dec. 2009","displayDocTitle":"A Multi-objective Genetic Algorithm Method to Support Multi-agent Negotiations","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"15 January 2010","accessionNumber":"11084855","publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5381059/","conferenceDate":"13-14 Dec. 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Multi-objective Genetic Algorithm Method to Support Multi-agent Negotiations","confLoc":"Sanya, China","sourcePdf":"3880a596.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.104783S","chronDate":"13-14 Dec. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5379694","isNumber":"5380897","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5379694","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"5380897","articleId":"5381059","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":5381082,"authors":[{"name":"Aiye Shi","affiliation":["College of Computer Information and Engineering, Hohai University, HHU, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Aiye","lastName":"Shi","id":"37391123700"},{"name":"Fengchen Huang","affiliation":["College of Computer Information and Engineering, Hohai University, HHU, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Fengchen","lastName":"Huang","id":"37535365400"},{"name":"Yang Pan","affiliation":["College of Computer Information and Engineering, Hohai University, HHU, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Yang","lastName":"Pan","id":"37672427900"},{"name":"Lizhong Xu","affiliation":["College of Computer Information and Engineering, Hohai University, HHU, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Lizhong","lastName":"Xu","id":"37279489800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5645-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5644-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3944-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5381082","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":122},"abstract":"Mutual information based image registration has the advantages of high precision and strong robustness.

Flatness is one of the most important features of rolled products, and it is used to estimate the final quality of the resulting product. Therefore, flatness control, which requires precise flatness measurements, is of vital importance during rolling. This work proposes a machine vision system for flatness measurement based on the projection of a laser stripe over the surface of the steel strip. The flatness measured cannot be used as easily as the feedback of the flatness control system due to the huge amount of information it contains. In order to solve this problem, a feature extraction method based on Legendre polynomial fit is also proposed.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Machine Vision System for Flatness Control Feedback","publicationTitle":"2009 Second International Conference on Machine Vision","doi":"10.1109/ICMV.2009.14","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Second International Conference on Machine Vision","pdfPath":"/iel5/5379704/5380895/05381094.pdf","startPage":"105","endPage":"110","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMV.2009.14","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5380895","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5381094","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5381094/","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-30 Dec. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Machine Vision System for Flatness Control Feedback","conferenceDate":"28-30 Dec. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5381094/","dateOfInsertion":"15 January 2010","publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","accessionNumber":"11085295","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Machine Vision System for Flatness Control Feedback","confLoc":"Dubai, United Arab Emirates","sourcePdf":"3944a105.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055785S","chronDate":"28-30 Dec. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5379704","isNumber":"5380895","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5379704","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"5380895","articleId":"5381094","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5381101,"authors":[{"name":"Lei Yunqi","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Xiamen University, Xiamen, China"],"firstName":"Lei","lastName":"Yunqi","id":"37284460000"},{"name":"Chen Dongjie","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Xiamen University, Xiamen, China"],"firstName":"Chen","lastName":"Dongjie","id":"37680588300"},{"name":"Yuan Meiling","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Xiamen University, Xiamen, China"],"firstName":"Yuan","lastName":"Meiling","id":"37396528700"},{"name":"Li Qingmin","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Xiamen University, Xiamen, China"],"firstName":"Li","lastName":"Qingmin","id":"37393536000"},{"name":"Shi Zhenxiang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Xiamen University, Xiamen, China"],"firstName":"Shi","lastName":"Zhenxiang","id":"37680586100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5645-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5644-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3944-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5381101","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":436},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Face recognition","Principal component analysis","Scattering","Lattices","Surface fitting","Spline","Image recognition","Clouds","Iterative closest point algorithm","Data mining"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["face recognition","principal component analysis","splines (mathematics)","surface fitting"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["3D face recognition","surface classification image","principal component analysis","multilevel B-splines approximation","surface fitting algorithm","Gaussian curvature","mean curvature","partial ICP method"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["3D face recognition","PCA","surface classification image","curvature feature image","point cloud nomalization"]}],"abstract":"An approach of 3D face recognition by using of facial surface classification image and PCA is presented. In the step of pre-processing, the scattered 3D points of a facial surface are normalized by surface fitting algorithm using multilevel B-splines approximation. Then, partial-ICP method is utilized to adjust 3D face model to be in the right front pose for a better recognition performance. By using the normalized facial depth image been acquired through the two previous steps, and by calculating the Gaussian and mean curvatures at each point, the surface types are classified and the classification result is used to mark different kinds of area on the facial depth image by 8 gray-levels. This achieved gray image is named as Surface Classification Image (SCI) and the SCI now represents the 3D features of the face and then it is input to the process of PCA to obtain the SCI eigenfaces to recognize the face.

The most important qualities of a speech synthesis system are naturalness and intelligibility. We synthesize the Marathi text and perform the subjective evaluations of the synthesized speech. As a result, (1) 81% of speech synthesized by the proposed method was preferred to that by the conventional method, (2) The error rate of TTS synthesizer is around 8.22%, (3) Speech synthesis runtime was reduced for proposed method.

The motivation is to address challenges associated with algorithm scalability, data sparsity and information loss due to the so-called curse of dimensionality. The original high dimensional feature space is randomly projected onto a number of lower-dimensional feature subspaces. Each of these subspaces constitutes the domain of a classification subtask, and is associated with a base learner within an ensemble machine-learner context. Such an ensemble conceptualization is called as random subsample ensemble. Simulation results performed on data sets with up to 20,000 features indicate that the random subsample ensemble classifier performs comparably to other benchmark machine learners based on performance measures of prediction accuracy and cpu time. This finding establishes the feasibility of the ensemble and positions it to tackle classification problems with even much higher dimensional feature spaces.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5381318/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 Dec. 2009","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"13-15 Dec. 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5381318/","dateOfInsertion":"15 January 2010","publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","accessionNumber":"11084862","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Classification in High-Dimensional Feature Spaces: Random Subsample Ensemble","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Classification in High-Dimensional Feature Spaces: Random Subsample Ensemble","confLoc":"Miami, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"3926a740.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058123S","chronDate":"13-15 Dec. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5379696","isNumber":"5381311","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5379696","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5381311","articleId":"5381318","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":5381380,"authors":[{"name":"Fujio Kurokawa","affiliation":["Nagasaki University, Nagasaki, Japan"],"firstName":"Fujio","lastName":"Kurokawa","id":"37283340700"},{"name":"Hidenori Maruta","affiliation":["Nagasaki University, Nagasaki, Japan"],"firstName":"Hidenori","lastName":"Maruta","id":"37541366500"},{"name":"Tomoyuki Mizoguchi","affiliation":["Nagasaki University, Nagasaki, Japan"],"firstName":"Tomoyuki","lastName":"Mizoguchi","id":"37603638600"},{"name":"Akihiro Nakamura","affiliation":["Nagasaki University, Nagasaki, Japan"],"firstName":"Akihiro","lastName":"Nakamura","id":"37592686300"},{"name":"Hiroyuki Osuga","affiliation":["Mitsubishi Electronic Corporation, Kamakura, Kanagawa, Japan"],"firstName":"Hiroyuki","lastName":"Osuga","id":"37603440400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3926-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5381380","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":467},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5381380","abstract":"The purpose of this paper is to present a new digital control method of the forward type multiple-output DC DC converter with both a PID feedback and a new feed forward control.

Then we use the trained neural network to forecast the computing-resource usage, i.e., free memory and used swap, with workload as its input.

Odometry modeling is one of the main approaches to solving the localization problem, the other being a sensor based correspondence solver. Currently few robot positioning systems support calibration of odometry errors in both feature rich indoor and landmark poor outdoor environments. To achieve good performance in various environments, the mobile robot has to be able to learn to localize in unknown environments, and reuse previously computed environment specific localization models. This paper presents a method combining the standard Back-Propagation technique and a feed-forward neural network model for odometry calibration for both synchronous and differential drive mobile robots. This novel method is compared with a generic localization module and an optimization based approach, and found to minimize odometry error because of its nonlinear input-output mapping ability. Experimental results demonstrate that the neural network approach incorporating Bayesian Regularization provides improved performance and relaxes constraints in the UMBmark method.","doi":"10.1109/ICMLA.2009.96","pdfPath":"/iel5/5379696/5381311/05381505.pdf","startPage":"378","endPage":"385","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Machine Learning and

However, OFDM is very sensitive to carrier frequency offset (CFO) which can destroy the orthogonality among subchannels. For OFDMA uplink systems with generalized carrier assignment scheme (GCAS), there are multiple CFOs need to be estimated simultaneously. While ML approach is recognized as one possible solution to this problem, its computational complexity is too high to be implemented for practical applications. To overcome this difficulty, this study employs particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithms to estimate CFOs for OFDMA uplink systems with GCAS. Furthermore, a PSO scheme integrated with the mutation operator of genetic algorithm (GA) is proposed to improve the performance of conventional PSO algorithm. Experimental result indicates that the proposed hybrid PSO algorithm can achieve the same performance as ML scheme but with much less computational complexity.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Estimation of Carrier Frequency Offset for Generalized OFDMA Uplink Systems Using Particle Swarm Optimization Algorithms","publicationTitle":"2009 10th International Symposium on Pervasive Systems, Algorithms, and Networks","doi":"10.1109/I-SPAN.2009.26","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 10th International Symposium on Pervasive Systems, Algorithms, and Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/5379703/5381549/05381577.pdf","startPage":"442","endPage":"447","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/I-SPAN.2009.26","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5381549","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5381577","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5381577/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-16 Dec. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Estimation of Carrier Frequency Offset for Generalized OFDMA Uplink Systems Using Particle Swarm Optimization Algorithms","conferenceDate":"14-16 Dec. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5381577/","dateOfInsertion":"15 January 2010","publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","accessionNumber":"11085145","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Estimation of Carrier Frequency Offset for Generalized OFDMA Uplink Systems Using Particle Swarm Optimization Algorithms","confLoc":"Kaoshiung, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"3908a442.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050562S","chronDate":"14-16 Dec. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5379703","isNumber":"5381549","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5379703","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"5381549","articleId":"5381577","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5381603,"authors":[{"name":"Jingping Liu","affiliation":["School of Electronic Engineering and Optoelectronic Technology, Nanjing University of Science and Technology of PLA, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Jingping","lastName":"Liu","id":"37675843600"},{"name":"Huichang Zhao","affiliation":["School of Electronic Engineering and Optoelectronic Technology, Nanjing University of Science and Technology of PLA, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Huichang","lastName":"Zhao","id":"37085628052"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5400-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5399-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3901-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5381603","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":300},"abstract":"In multiple input and multiple output (MIMO) system, the channel code is very important and complex compare single antenna system.

However, it remains very expensive and the few valuable traditional mutants that resemble real faults are mixed in with many others that denote unrealistic faults.These twin problems of expense and realism have been a significant barrier to industrial uptake of mutation testing. Genetic programming is used to search the space of complex faults (higher order mutants). The space is much larger than the traditional first order mutation space of simple faults. However, the use of a search based approach makes this scalable, seeking only those mutants that challenge the tester, while the consideration of complex faults addresses the problem of fault realism; it is known that 90% of real faults are complex (i.e. higher order). We show that we are able to find examples that pose challenges to testing in the higher order space that cannot be represented in the first order space.","doi":"10.1109/TAICPART.2009.18","publicationTitle":"2009 Testing: Academic and Industrial Conference - Practice and Research Techniques","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Testing: Academic and Industrial Conference - Practice and Research Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel5/5379697/5381544/05381650.pdf","startPage":"21","endPage":"29","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAICPART.2009.18","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5381544","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multi Objective Higher Order Mutation Testing with Genetic Programming","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5381650","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-6 Sept. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5381650/","displayDocTitle":"Multi Objective Higher Order Mutation Testing with Genetic Programming","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"11101967","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5381650/","conferenceDate":"4-6 Sept. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"15 January 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multi Objective Higher Order Mutation Testing with Genetic Programming","confLoc":"Windsor, UK","sourcePdf":"3820a021.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.082606S","chronDate":"4-6 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5379697","isNumber":"5381544","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5379697","citationCount":"30","xplore-issue":"5381544","articleId":"5381650","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5381676,"authors":[{"name":"M.F.

The proposed adaptive transmission schemes utilize the measured delay time relative information to adaptively change the GI length or modulation method of OFDM signals, achieving high transmission quality and efficiency simultaneously.

Efficient CPU and GPU intersection algorithms for large problem size are well studied. We propose an efficient GPU algorithm for high performance intersection of inverted index lists on CUDA platform. This algorithm feeds queries to GPU in batches, thus can take full advantage of GPU processor cores even if problem size is small. We also propose an input preprocessing method which alleviate load imbalance effectively. Our experimental results based on a real world test set show that the batched algorithm is much faster than the fastest CPU algorithm and plain GPU algorithm.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5381727/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-16 Dec. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"15 January 2010","publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","accessionNumber":"11085201","htmlLink":"/document/5381727/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"14-16 Dec. 2009","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A Batched GPU Algorithm for Set Intersection","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Batched GPU Algorithm for Set Intersection","confLoc":"Kaoshiung, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"3908a752.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044091S","chronDate":"14-16 Dec. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5379703","isNumber":"5381549","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5379703","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"5381549","articleId":"5381727","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5381728,"authors":[{"name":"Ra\u00fal Cabido","affiliation":["Departamento de Ciencias de la Computaci\u00f2n, Universidad Rey Juan Carlos de Madrid, Madrid, Spain"],"firstName":"Ra\u00fal","lastName":"Cabido","id":"38364135600"},{"name":"David Concha","affiliation":["Departamento de Ciencias de la Computaci\u00f2n, Universidad Rey Juan Carlos de Madrid, Madrid, Spain"],"firstName":"David","lastName":"Concha","id":"37670519300"},{"name":"Juan Jos\u00e9 Pantrigo","affiliation":["Departamento de Ciencias de la Computaci\u00f2n, Universidad Rey Juan Carlos de Madrid, Madrid, Spain"],"firstName":"Juan Jos\u00e9","lastName":"Pantrigo","id":"37565716300"},{"name":"Antonio S.

This work is concerned with proposing a novel method which adaptively adjusts EA and specifically genetic algorithm (GA) mutation rates. The proposed method incorporates the underlying statistical framework of biological evolutionary models into the generic context of evolutionary algorithms. By using such model, besides adapting the mutation rate, this method aims to wisely determine the types of replacing genes in the mutation procedure. To demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed algorithm, the method is evaluated using a wide array of test functions and the outcome is compared with a state-of-the-art adaptive mutation evolutionary algorithm.

Autonomous TPA means that, all tasks should be (re)planned and (re)allocated automatically according to the synthesis constraints and the dynamic environment aspects, such as the changing mission, status of each member, and topology, etc. In this article, the formal descriptions of hierarchical tasks and models of logic constraints are studied firstly. And then, some new methods are proposed to evaluate the efficiency of synthesis constraints. Moreover, the key elements, e.g. task allocation vector (TAV), are designed with the theory of genetic algorithm (GA), and a TPA problem can be mapped to the solving model of GA. Based on above, the crossover and mutation operators of GA are optimized with the domain knowledge to perfect the solving efficiency and quality while ensuring the randomicity of evolution. The simulation results show that the solving quality and velocity are improved with studied methods.","doi":"10.1109/SERA.2009.21","startPage":"10","endPage":"15","publicationTitle":"2009 Seventh ACIS International Conference on Software Engineering Research, Management and Applications","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SERA.2009.21","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5381720","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Seventh ACIS International Conference on Software Engineering Research, Management and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5379700/5381720/05381818.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Synthesis Constraints Optimized Genetic Algorithm for Autonomous Task Planning and Allocating in MAS","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5381818/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Synthesis Constraints Optimized Genetic Algorithm for Autonomous Task Planning and Allocating in MAS","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5381818/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11073592","publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"15 January 2010","conferenceDate":"2-4 Dec. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-4 Dec. 2009","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Synthesis Constraints Optimized Genetic Algorithm for Autonomous Task Planning and Allocating in MAS","confLoc":"Haikou, China","sourcePdf":"3903a010.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062838S","chronDate":"2-4 Dec. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5379700","isNumber":"5381720","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5379700","xplore-issue":"5381720","articleId":"5381818","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5381824,"authors":[{"name":"Aydin Ulas","affiliation":["Department of Computer Engineering, Bo\u011fazi\u00e7i University, Istanbul, Turkey"],"firstName":"Aydin","lastName":"Ulas","id":"38193041200"},{"name":"Olcay Taner Yildiz","affiliation":["Department of Computer Engineering, I\u015fik University, Istanbul, Turkey"],"firstName":"Olcay Taner","lastName":"Yildiz","id":"37724763700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3926-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5381824","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":97},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hidden Markov models","Machine learning","Computer architecture","Machine learning algorithms","Data engineering","Graphical models","Bayesian methods","Application software","State-space methods","Computational complexity"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","hidden Markov models","learning (artificial intelligence)","optimisation","tree searching"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["incremental model selection algorithm","cross-validation","hidden Markov model","hand gesture data sets","multiparameter learning problem","state space search","forward/backward search","single/multiple operators","depth-first/breadth-first search","computational complexity"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Hidden Markov model","model selection","cross-validation"]}],"abstract":"In a multi-parameter learning problem, besides choosing the architecture of the learner, there is the problem of finding the optimal parameters to get maximum performance. When the number of parameters to be tuned increases, it becomes infeasible to try all the parameter sets, hence we need an automatic mechanism to find the optimum parameter setting using computationally feasible algorithms. In this paper, we define the problem of optimizing the architecture of a hidden Markov model (HMM) as a state space search and propose the MSUMO (model selection using multiple operators) framework that incrementally modifies the structure and checks for improvement using cross-validation. There are five variants that use forward/backward search, single/multiple operators, and depth-first/breadth-first search. On four hand gesture data sets, we compare the performance of MSUMO with the optimal parameter set found by exhaustive search in terms of expected error and computational complexity.","doi":"10.1109/ICMLA.2009.91","publicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Machine Learning and Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Machine Learning and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5379696/5381311/05381824.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMLA.2009.91","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5381311","startPage":"170","endPage":"177","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Incremental Model Selection Algorithm Based on Cross-Validation for Finding the Architecture of a Hidden Markov Model on Hand Gesture Data Sets","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5381824","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"An Incremental Model Selection Algorithm Based on Cross-Validation for Finding the Architecture of a Hidden Markov Model on Hand Gesture Data Sets","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 Dec. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5381824/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"13-15 Dec. 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","accessionNumber":"11084954","dateOfInsertion":"15 January 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5381824/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Incremental Model Selection Algorithm Based on Cross-Validation for Finding the Architecture of a Hidden Markov Model on Hand Gesture Data Sets","confLoc":"Miami, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"3926a170.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.112999S","chronDate":"13-15 Dec. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5379696","isNumber":"5381311","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5379696","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5381311","articleId":"5381824","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5381827,"authors":[{"name":"Oualid Missaoui","affiliation":["CECS, University of Louisville, KY, USA"],"firstName":"Oualid","lastName":"Missaoui","id":"37594521800"},{"name":"Hichem Frigui","affiliation":["CECS, University of Louisville, KY, USA"],"firstName":"Hichem","lastName":"Frigui","id":"37271972100"},{"name":"Paul Gader","affiliation":["CISE, University of Florida, FL, USA"],"firstName":"Paul","lastName":"Gader","id":"37271974000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3926-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5381827","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":67},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hidden Markov models","Sequences","Information resources","Speech recognition","Computer vision","Application software","Probability density function","Training data","Maximum likelihood estimation","Parameter estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["gradient methods","hidden Markov models","optimisation","pattern classification","probability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["discriminative multistream discrete hidden Markov models","multimodality","heteregoneous modality","relevance weights","partial probability","observation state probability","minimum classification error objective","gradient probabilistic descent optimization algorithm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Hidden Markov Models","Multi-stream","Discriminative training","minimum classification error"]}],"abstract":"We propose a modified discrete HMM that handles multimodalities. We assume that the feature space is partitioned into subspaces generated by different sources of information. To combine these heteregoneous modalities we propose a multi-stream discrete HMM that assigns a relevance weight to each subspace. The relevance weights are set local and depend on the symbols and the states. In particular, we associate a partial probability with each symbol in each subspace. The overall observation state probability is then computed as an aggregation of the partial probabilities and their objective relevance weights based on a linear combination. The minimum classification error (MCE) objective based on the gradient probabilistic descent (GPD) optimization algorithm is reformulated to derive the update equations for the relevance weights and the partial state probabilities. The proposed approach is validated using synthetic and real data sets. The results are shown to outperform the baseline discrete HMM that treats all streams equally important.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Discriminative Multi-stream Discrete Hidden Markov Models","publicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Machine Learning and Applications","doi":"10.1109/ICMLA.2009.121","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Machine Learning and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5379696/5381311/05381827.pdf","startPage":"178","endPage":"183","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMLA.2009.121","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5381311","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5381827","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5381827/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 Dec. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Discriminative Multi-stream Discrete Hidden Markov Models","conferenceDate":"13-15 Dec. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5381827/","dateOfInsertion":"15 January 2010","publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","accessionNumber":"11084955","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Discriminative Multi-stream Discrete Hidden Markov Models","confLoc":"Miami, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"3926a178.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052148S","chronDate":"13-15 Dec. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5379696","isNumber":"5381311","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5379696","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5381311","articleId":"5381827","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5381861,"authors":[{"name":"WenJie Tian","affiliation":["Automation Institute, Beijing Union University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"WenJie","lastName":"Tian","id":"37306902300"},{"name":"JiCheng Liu","affiliation":["Automation Institute, Beijing Union University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"JiCheng","lastName":"Liu","id":"37310112300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5400-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5399-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3901-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5381861","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":183},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Intrusion detection","Algorithm design and analysis","Particle swarm optimization","Pattern analysis","Convergence","Artificial neural networks","Automation","Wireless networks","Information systems","Information analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["particle swarm optimisation","rough set theory","security of data","support vector machines","unsupervised learning"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["intrusion detection quantitative analysis","support vector regression","particle swarm optimization algorithm","pattern analysis","self-learning","rough set","KDD99 data set"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["support vector regression","intrusion detection","particle swarm optimization algorithm","rough set","convergence"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5381861","abstract":"Because the network intrusion behaviors are characterized with uncertainty, complexity and diversity, a new method based on support vector regression (SVR) and particle swarm optimization algorithm (PSOA) is presented and used for pattern analysis of intrusion detection in this paper.

Since the OFDMA physical resource available for scheduling is frame by frame, the uplink scheduler located at base station (BS) must efficiently allocate available resources to the subscriber stations (SSs) in response to constant or bursty data traffic on a per-frame basis. In general, voice and video packets are generated periodically with fixed size packets (i.e. UGS) or periodic variable sizes packets due to coding technologies. Therefore, we propose an uplink scheduling strategy jointing bandwidth allocation and excess bandwidth compensation considering both short-term and long-term periods. Besides, this strategy grants the available resource for real-time and non-real-time traffics, called Frame-based Adaptive Bandwidth Allocation (FBABA) and Minimum Guarantee and Weight-based Bandwidth Allocation (MGWBA), respectively.

In this paper, we propose a two dimensional (2-D) pilot-aided channel estimator for OFDM systems, whose purpose is to reduce bit error rate by using different pilot arrangement in fast fading channels. The major concept behind the proposed scheme is to estimate the channel in time and frequency domain. So we first obtain the channel frequency response of a number of subcarriers via before-mentioned interpolators in time domain. Next, using this estimations and the channel responses, which obtained in pilot frequencies we estimate the channel in frequency domain and achieve the channel in all frequencies. Consequently, using the fewer pilots, the more accurate channel estimation will be obtained. We have compared the performance of our proposed 2-D channel estimator with conventional channel estimators.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Wireless Networks and Information Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5379690/5381547/05381898.pdf","startPage":"209","endPage":"212","publicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Wireless Networks and Information Systems","doi":"10.1109/WNIS.2009.31","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WNIS.2009.31","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5381547","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5381898","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Channel Estimation in Time and Frequency Domain in OFDM Systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Channel estimation","Frequency domain analysis","OFDM","Frequency estimation","Interpolation","Fading","Spline","Two dimensional displays","Bit error rate","Frequency response"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","error statistics","interpolation","OFDM modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["orthogonal frequency division multiplexing systems","OFDM systems","fading channels","linear interpolation","cubic interpolation","spline interpolation","two dimensional pilot-aided channel estimator","bit error rate","channel frequency response","LS criteria"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["OFDM","channel estimation","frequency domain interpolation","pilot arrangement","time domain interpolation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5381898/","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-29 Dec. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Channel Estimation in Time and Frequency Domain in OFDM Systems","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5381898/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","accessionNumber":"11073446","dateOfInsertion":"15 January 2010","conferenceDate":"28-29 Dec. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Channel Estimation in Time and Frequency Domain in OFDM Systems","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"3901a209.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058055S","chronDate":"28-29 Dec. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5379690","isNumber":"5381547","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5379690","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5381547","articleId":"5381898","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5381899,"authors":[{"name":"Hung-Min Sun","affiliation":["National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Hung-Min","lastName":"Sun","id":"37277692800"},{"name":"Shih-Ying Chang","affiliation":["National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Shih-Ying","lastName":"Chang","id":"37407129000"},{"name":"Yu-Hsiang Hung","affiliation":["National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Yu-Hsiang","lastName":"Hung","id":"37668006300"},{"name":"Yu-Kai Tseng","affiliation":["National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Yu-Kai","lastName":"Tseng","id":"37672895100"},{"name":"Hsin-Ta Chiao","affiliation":["Industrial Technology and Research Institute, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Hsin-Ta","lastName":"Chiao","id":"37331066900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5404-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5403-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-3908-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1087-4089"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2375-527X"}],"articleNumber":"5381899","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":121},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Forward error correction","Cathode ray tubes","Bandwidth","Redundancy","Wireless sensor networks","Sun","Electronic mail","Reliability theory","Data communication","Wireless networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["error correction codes","forward error correction","multicast communication","number theory","reliability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["forward error correction codes","Chinese remainder theorem","reliable multicast data distribution","decomposable property","data transmission"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["reliable multicast","forward error correction","Chinese remainder theorem"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5381899","abstract":"Several applications benefited from multicast data distribution because a sender can concurrently transmit data to multiple receivers using fewer bandwidth. However, reliability is an important issue in multicast because retransmission is not very efficient in multicast. In recent years, Forward Error Correction (FEC) codes are proposed to facilitate reliable multicast data distribution and are applied to several applications. FEC provides a more efficient way of reliable multicast data distribution because of no retransmission. In this paper, we propose a new FEC codes (F-CR codes), which are extended from Chinese Remainder codes, require smaller transmission redundancy than conventional FEC codes and support two variants for transmission and computation efficiency. In particular, the r-decomposition variant allows the sender to decompose an output symbols encoded into r smaller sub-symbols. This decomposable property which is firstly proposed in this paper is especially suitable for link unstable networks or link heterogeneity networks like wireless sensor networks. The analysis and experiments also demonstrate the feasibility of F-CR codes.","doi":"10.1109/I-SPAN.2009.91","publicationTitle":"2009 10th International Symposium on Pervasive Systems, Algorithms, and Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 10th International Symposium on Pervasive Systems, Algorithms, and Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/5379703/5381549/05381899.pdf","startPage":"260","endPage":"265","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5381549","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/I-SPAN.2009.91","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Decomposable Forward Error Correction Codes Based on Chinese Remainder Theorem","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5381899/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-16 Dec. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Decomposable Forward Error Correction Codes Based on Chinese Remainder Theorem","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5381899/","dateOfInsertion":"15 January 2010","publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","accessionNumber":"11085229","conferenceDate":"14-16 Dec. 2009","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Decomposable Forward Error Correction Codes Based on Chinese Remainder Theorem","confLoc":"Kaoshiung, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"3908a260.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071077S","chronDate":"14-16 Dec. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5379703","isNumber":"5381549","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5379703","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5381549","articleId":"5381899","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5381941,"authors":[{"name":"Ding Jun","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Engineering, Yunnan University, Kunming, China"],"firstName":"Ding","lastName":"Jun","id":"37401965100"},{"name":"Li Na","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Engineering, Yunnan University, Kunming, China"],"firstName":"Li","lastName":"Na","id":"37409139600"},{"name":"Guo Yixiong","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Engineering, Yunnan University, Kunming, China"],"firstName":"Guo","lastName":"Yixiong","id":"37395559000"},{"name":"Yang Jun","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Engineering, Yunnan University, Kunming, China"],"firstName":"Yang","lastName":"Jun","id":"37396110900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5400-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5399-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3901-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5381941","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":352},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Field programmable gate arrays","Automata","Cryptography","Information systems","Parallel processing","Information processing","Information technology","Biological system modeling","Mathematical model","Information security"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular automata","computer network security","cryptography","field programmable gate arrays","random number generation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["high-performance pseudo-random number generator","FPGA","cellular automaton","component units","local units connectivity","information processing","cryptography","information technology security","network security"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cellular automaton","Pseudo-random number","Rule 30","FPGA"]}],"abstract":"This article mainly describes a way of designing an efficient pseudo-random number generator.

Traditionally, these needs have been addressed by using high-performance computing solutions and installed facilities such as clusters and super computers, which are difficult to setup, maintain, and operate. Cloud computing provides scientists with a completely new model of utilizing the computing infrastructure. Compute resources, storage resources, as well as applications, can be dynamically provisioned (and integrated within the existing infrastructure) on a pay per use basis. These resources can be released when they are no more needed. Such services are often offered within the context of a service level agreement (SLA), which ensure the desired quality of service (QoS). Aneka, an enterprise cloud computing solution, harnesses the power of compute resources by relying on private and public clouds and delivers to users the desired QoS. Its flexible and service based infrastructure supports multiple programming paradigms that make Aneka address a variety of different scenarios: from finance applications to computational science.

The recent Izhikevich spiking neuron model is ideally suited for such large scale cortical simulations due to its efficiency and biological accuracy. In this paper we explore the feasibility of using FPGAs for large scale simulations of the Izhikevich model. We developed a modularized processing element to evaluate a large number of Izhikevich spiking neurons in a pipelined manner. This approach allows for easy scalability of the model to larger FPGAs. We utilized a character recognition algorithm based on the Izhikevich model for this study and scaled up the algorithm to use over 9000 neurons. The FPGA implementation of the algorithm on a Xilinx Virtex 4 provided a speedup of approximately 8.5 times an equivalent software implementation on a 2.2 GHz AMD Opteron core.

A case study is discussed to demonstrate an example of swapping a Flash memory controller and an SRAM controller in response to diverse memory access needs. Result analysis reveals a more efficient resource utilization of 52.1% I/O pads, 86.5% LUTs and 81.3% Flip-Flops, when compared to the static design with same functionalities. A small reconfiguration overhead of context switching is measured within the range from hundreds of microseconds to milliseconds.

has lead to the concept of universal memories. MRAM (magnetoresistive random access memory) is one prominent member of them. At present only Flash is providing a limited bridge for that. Flash based FPGAs have several benefits being non volatile but unfortunately also loose many of the features which are only possible with SRAM based FPGAs. MRAMs have potential to bridge this gap. This paper will present a brief survey of our work in this regard for creating the entire eco system of software and hardware tool flows, MRAM layout work at 120 nm, exploration environments to conduct complex experiments especially dynamic reconfiguration and multi context FPGAs. MRAM opens new opportunities for them compared to SRAM and Flash. It will discuss the current status of MRAM in industry and our current and future test chips road maps. Provide several references to industry and our published work for details about MRAMs and eFPGAs, to show why we think MRAM can be very interesting element for FPGAs.","doi":"10.1109/ReConFig.2009.25","publicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Reconfigurable Computing and FPGAs","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Reconfigurable Computing and FPGAs","pdfPath":"/iel5/5379688/5381991/05382021.pdf","startPage":"18","endPage":"23","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ReConFig.2009.25","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5381991","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"MRAM Based eFPGAs: Programming and Silicon Flows, Exploration Environments, MRAM Current State in Industry and Its Unique Potentials for FPGAs","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"MRAM Based eFPGAs: Programming and Silicon Flows, Exploration Environments, MRAM Current State in Industry and Its Unique Potentials for FPGAs","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"15 January 2010","accessionNumber":"11073351","publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5382021/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5382021/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-11 Dec. 2009","conferenceDate":"9-11 Dec. 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"MRAM Based eFPGAs: Programming and Silicon Flows, Exploration Environments, MRAM Current State in Industry and Its Unique Potentials for FPGAs","confLoc":"Cancun, Mexico","sourcePdf":"3917a018.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.037033S","chronDate":"9-11 Dec. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5379688","isNumber":"5381991","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5379688","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5381991","articleId":"5382021","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":5382022,"authors":[{"name":"Taciano A.

This paper presents a complete solution for an optical transport network framer using FPGA devices. The framer receives a 10 Gbps stream originated from optical fiber medium, extracts its payload information, and transmits payload data at 10 Gbps.

The target clock rate is 156 MHz with the links running at 6.24 Gbit/s and 200 MHz for the HyperTransport Core. This goal was reached with a 32-bit wide data path in the network-switch and link blocks. The integrated switch reaches an aggregate bandwidth of more than 45 Gbit/s.

However, one significant limitation of FPGAs that has prevented their use on important applications is the requirement for regular memory access patterns. Traversal caches were previously introduced to improve the performance of FPGA implementations of algorithms with irregular memory access patterns, especially those traversing pointer-based data structures. However, a significant limitation of previous traversal caches is that speedup was limited to traversals repeated frequently over time, thus preventing speedup for algorithms without repetition, even if the similarity between traversals was large. This paper presents a new framework that extends traversal caches to enable performance improvements in such cases and provides additional improvements through reduced memory accesses and parallel processing of multiple traversals. Most importantly, we show that, for algorithms with highly similar traversals, the traversal cache framework achieves approximately linear kernel speedup with additional area, thus eliminating the memory bandwidth bottleneck commonly associated with FPGAs. We evaluate the framework using a Barnes-Hut n-body simulation case study, showing application speedups ranging from 12\u00d7 to 13.5\u00d7 on a Virtex4 LX100 with projected speedups as high as 40\u00d7 on today's largest FPGAs.","doi":"10.1109/ReConFig.2009.68","publicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Reconfigurable Computing and FPGAs","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Reconfigurable Computing and FPGAs","pdfPath":"/iel5/5379688/5381991/05382042.pdf","startPage":"143","endPage":"148","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ReConFig.2009.68","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5381991","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5382042","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Traversal Cache Framework for FPGA Acceleration of Pointer Data Structures: A Case Study on Barnes-Hut N-body Simulation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-11 Dec. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5382042/","displayDocTitle":"A Traversal Cache Framework for FPGA Acceleration of Pointer Data Structures: A Case Study on Barnes-Hut N-body Simulation","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5382042/","publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"15 January 2010","conferenceDate":"9-11 Dec. 2009","accessionNumber":"11073319","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Traversal Cache Framework for FPGA Acceleration of Pointer Data Structures: A Case Study on Barnes-Hut N-body Simulation","confLoc":"Cancun, Mexico","sourcePdf":"3917a143.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.089675S","chronDate":"9-11 Dec. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5379688","isNumber":"5381991","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5379688","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"5381991","articleId":"5382042","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5382044,"authors":[{"name":"Naoki Tanida","affiliation":["University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Naoki","lastName":"Tanida","id":"38109569600"},{"name":"Mary Inaba","affiliation":["University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Mary","lastName":"Inaba","id":"37268957500"},{"name":"Kei Hiraki","affiliation":["University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Kei","lastName":"Hiraki","id":"37266647700"},{"name":"Takeshi Yoshino","affiliation":["Google Japan, Inc., Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Takeshi","lastName":"Yoshino","id":"37891070900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5293-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-3917-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2325-6532"}],"articleNumber":"5382044","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":191},"abstract":"Efficient utilization of massive data, such as full-text search has become important in view of the growing needs for Web search and genome analysis. High-speed search and small storage space are required to handle massive amounts of data. For high-speed search, generally, a data structure such as index which needs additional storage space is required. Recently, compressed suffix array, which is a data structure with an indexable dictionary that can be used to compress data to its information-theoretic lower bound, has been proposed. The distinctive feature of this array is that it enables direct data retrieval without decompression from the compressed data. Further, theoretically, the computational complexity of data retrieval is the same for both compressed and uncompressed data when we assume that rank operation involving the bit vector can be executed in constant time; this rank operation returns the number of occurrences of smaller elements. Practically, rank operation involves many bit-manipulations and random access to the memory. Hence, this constant time is not negligible, and as a result, data retrieval using compressed suffix array is relatively slower than that using plain suffix array. Although compression to create an indexable dictionary is performed only once, data retrieval queries occur repeatedly. Hence, high speed rank operations involving bit vectors are essential for compressed suffix arrays. We propose a FPGA-based hardware accelerator for full-text search (HAFTS) with compressed suffix array. FPGA helps speedup rank operation for compressed suffix array by enabling many bit calculations performed simultaneously and controlling the order of memory accesses. We conduct performance simulations of HAFTS. We consider a development board on which FPGA is connected to DDR2-800 SDRAM by a 64-bit bus as our model. We evaluate the performance of HAFTS by comparing it with that of software implementation. As a result, we conclude that the search speed of FPGA-based HAFTS is seven times faster than that of software implementation.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Reconfigurable Computing and FPGAs","pdfPath":"/iel5/5379688/5381991/05382044.pdf","startPage":"155","endPage":"160","publicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Reconfigurable Computing and FPGAs","doi":"10.1109/ReConFig.2009.74","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ReConFig.2009.74","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5381991","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5382044","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hardware Accelerator for Full-Text Search (HAFTS) with Succinct Data Structure","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hardware","Data structures","Information retrieval","Dictionaries","Field programmable gate arrays","Web search","Genomics","Bioinformatics","Computational complexity","SDRAM"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","data compression","data structures","field programmable gate arrays","information theory","query formulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["full-text search","succinct data structure","Web search","genome analysis","high-speed search","small storage space","indexable dictionary","information-theoretic lower bound","computational complexity","data retrieval","plain suffix array","high speed rank operation","bit vectors","compressed suffix arrays","FPGA-based hardware accelerator"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["full-text search","succinct data structure","compressed suffix array","FPGA"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5382044/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-11 Dec. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Hardware Accelerator for Full-Text Search (HAFTS) with Succinct Data Structure","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5382044/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","accessionNumber":"11073342","dateOfInsertion":"15 January 2010","conferenceDate":"9-11 Dec. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hardware Accelerator for Full-Text Search (HAFTS) with Succinct Data Structure","confLoc":"Cancun, Mexico","sourcePdf":"3917a155.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06144S","chronDate":"9-11 Dec. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5379688","isNumber":"5381991","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5379688","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5381991","articleId":"5382044","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5382046,"authors":[{"name":"Oscar Alvarado Nava","affiliation":["Departamento de Electr\u00f3nica, Universidad Aut\u00f3noma Metropoiitana, Mexico"],"firstName":"Oscar Alvarado","lastName":"Nava","id":"38108807300"},{"name":"Arturo D\u00edaz P\u00e9rez","affiliation":["Laboratorio de Tecnolog\u00edas de Informaci\u00f3n, Centro de Investigaci\u00f3n y de Estudios Avanazados del Instituto Polit\u00e9cnico Nacional, Mexico"],"firstName":"Arturo D\u00edaz","lastName":"P\u00e9rez","id":"38104734000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5293-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-3917-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2325-6532"}],"articleNumber":"5382046","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":193},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Acceleration of Fractal Image Compression Using the Hardware-Software Co-design Methodology","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Acceleration","Fractals","Image coding","Hardware","Application software","Field programmable gate arrays","Digital images","Image storage","Computational efficiency","Application specific integrated circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","fractals","hardware-software codesign","image coding","system-on-chip","VLSI"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fractal image compression","hardware software codesign methodology","lossy technique","VLSI technology","gate density","embedded processors","SoC","FPGA"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Hardware-Software Co-Design","FPGA","Fractal Compression"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5382046","abstract":"Fractal Image Compression (FIC) is a lossy technique whose features are promising for computer systems with few resources, however, it has been ignored due to the large amount of operations needed to complete the codification.

The Generalized Hough Transform (GHT) is a popular image processing technique that is able to locate an object in an image. In its original formulation, this algorithm has a regular computation pattern, but suffers from high computational and memory requirements. More efficient GHT implementations have been carried out leading to computation and memory saving at the expenses of introducing irregularities in the computation, which make more difficult the design of a specific hardware solution. This work proposes the use of Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) for the implementation of an efficient version of the GHT. The development of the GHT has been divided into several functional blocks. This permits us to take advantage of a progressive reduction of the data flow and the algorithm stages, in order to optimize the use of the FPGA resources and clock cycles. We have tested our design by applying the GHT to the similarity calculation of frames in a video sequence.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5382047/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-11 Dec. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","accessionNumber":"11073356","htmlLink":"/document/5382047/","dateOfInsertion":"15 January 2010","conferenceDate":"9-11 Dec. 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"FPGA Implementation of the Generalized Hough Transform","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FPGA Implementation of the Generalized Hough Transform","confLoc":"Cancun, Mexico","sourcePdf":"3917a172.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.076648S","chronDate":"9-11 Dec. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5379688","isNumber":"5381991","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5379688","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"5381991","articleId":"5382047","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5382049,"authors":[{"name":"Julien Bringer","affiliation":["Sagem S\u00e9curit\u00e9, France"],"firstName":"Julien","lastName":"Bringer","id":"37596358100"},{"name":"Herv\u00e9 Chabanne","affiliation":["Sagem S\u00e9curit\u00e9 and T\u00e9l\u00e9com ParisTech, France"],"firstName":"Herv\u00e9","lastName":"Chabanne","id":"37373992100"},{"name":"Jean-Luc Danger","affiliation":["T\u00e9l\u00e9com Paris Technology, France"],"firstName":"Jean-Luc","lastName":"Danger","id":"37275155000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5293-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-3917-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2325-6532"}],"articleNumber":"5382049","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":119},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Protection","Field programmable gate arrays","Cryptography","Reverse engineering","Hardware","Table lookup","GSM","Resists","Software algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cryptography","field programmable gate arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["NOEKEON cipher","SCARE attacks","FPGA","dynamic implementations","side channel analysis-for-reverse engineering attacks","white-box cryptography","software implementation","field-programmable gate array","block cipher"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["SCARE attacks","white-box cryptography","FPGA"]}],"abstract":"Protecting an implementation against side channel analysis for reverse engineering (SCARE) attacks is a great challenge and we address this challenge by presenting a first proof of concept. White-box cryptography has been developed to protect programs against an adversary who has full access to their software implementation.

We consider that the adversary has only access to the cryptographic device through its side channels and his goal is to recover the specifications of the algorithm. In this work, we focus on FPGA (field-programmable gate array) technologies and examine how to thwart SCARE attacks by implementing a block cipher following white-box techniques.

Two strategies are customarily employed by malevolent adversaries: observation and differential perturbation attacks, also called SCA and DFA in the abundant scientific literature on this topic. Numerous research efforts have been carried out to defeat respectively SCA or DFA. However, few publications deal with concomitant protection against both threats. The current consensus is to devise algorithmic countermeasures to DFA and subsequently to synthesize the DFA-protected design thanks to a DPA-resistant CAD flow. In this article, we put to the fore that this approach is the best neither in terms of performance nor of relevance. Notably, the contribution of this paper is to demonstrate that the strongest SCA countermeasure known so far, namely the dual-rail with precharge logic styles that do not evaluate early, happen surprisingly to be almost natively immune to most DFAs. Therefore, unexpected two-in-one solutions against SCA and DFA indeed exist and deserve a closer attention, because they ally simplicity with efficiency. In particular, we illustrate a logic style, called WDDL without early evaluation (WDDL w/o EE), and a design flow that realizes in practice one possible combined DPA and DFA counter-measure especially suited for reconfigurable hardware.","publicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Reconfigurable Computing and FPGAs","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Reconfigurable Computing and FPGAs","pdfPath":"/iel5/5379688/5381991/05382054.pdf","startPage":"213","endPage":"218","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ReConFig.2009.50","doi":"10.1109/ReConFig.2009.50","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5381991","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Combined SCA and DFA Countermeasures Integrable in a FPGA Design Flow","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Combined SCA and DFA Countermeasures Integrable in a FPGA Design Flow","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5382054/","conferenceDate":"9-11 Dec. 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5382054/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"15 January 2010","publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","accessionNumber":"11073373","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-11 Dec. 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Combined SCA and DFA Countermeasures Integrable in a FPGA Design Flow","confLoc":"Cancun, Mexico","sourcePdf":"3917a213.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.134117S","chronDate":"9-11 Dec. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5379688","isNumber":"5381991","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5379688","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"5381991","articleId":"5382054","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5382055,"authors":[{"name":"Solmaz Ghaznavi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Waterloo, Waterloo, Canada"],"firstName":"Solmaz","lastName":"Ghaznavi","id":"37869583100"},{"name":"Catherine Gebotys","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Waterloo, Waterloo, Canada"],"firstName":"Catherine","lastName":"Gebotys","id":"37265040400"},{"name":"Reouven Elbaz","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Waterloo, Waterloo, Canada"],"firstName":"Reouven","lastName":"Elbaz","id":"37601621700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5293-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-3917-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2325-6532"}],"articleNumber":"5382055","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":513},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Field programmable gate arrays","Hardware","Cryptography","Embedded system","Table lookup","Data security","Authentication","Delay","Resource management","Equations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cryptography","field programmable gate arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FPGA implementation","AES MixColumns transformation","hardware architectures","hardware resource usage","block memories","SubBytes transformation","AES encryption","block cipher modes","advanced encryption standard","critical path delay"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["AES","MixColumns","FPGA","LUT","architecture"]}],"abstract":"The advanced encryption standard, AES, is commonly used to provide several security services such as data confidentiality or authentication in embedded systems.

Overall, incorporating the proposed technique along with block memories for the SubBytes transformation in the AES encryption reduces usage of hardware resources by up to 10% and 18% in terms of slices and LUTs, respectively. The improvement is obtained by more efficient resource sharing through expansion and rearrangement of the MixColumns equation with respect to the structure of FPGAs. This can be highly advantageous in an FPGA implementation of block cipher modes using AES in many secure embedded systems.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient Technique for the FPGA Implementation of the AES MixColumns Transformation","publicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Reconfigurable Computing and FPGAs","doi":"10.1109/ReConFig.2009.52","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Reconfigurable Computing and FPGAs","pdfPath":"/iel5/5379688/5381991/05382055.pdf","startPage":"219","endPage":"224","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ReConFig.2009.52","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5381991","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5382055","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5382055/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-11 Dec. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Efficient Technique for the FPGA Implementation of the AES MixColumns Transformation","conferenceDate":"9-11 Dec. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5382055/","dateOfInsertion":"15 January 2010","publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","accessionNumber":"11073326","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient Technique for the FPGA Implementation of the AES MixColumns Transformation","confLoc":"Cancun, Mexico","sourcePdf":"3917a219.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.083465S","chronDate":"9-11 Dec. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5379688","isNumber":"5381991","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5379688","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"5381991","articleId":"5382055","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5382056,"authors":[{"name":"Panasayya Yalla","affiliation":["Department of ECE, Volgenau School of IT&E, George Mason University, Fairfax, VA, USA"],"firstName":"Panasayya","lastName":"Yalla","id":"38110981400"},{"name":"Jens-Peter Kaps","affiliation":["Department of ECE, Volgenau School of IT&E, George Mason University, Fairfax, VA, USA"],"firstName":"Jens-Peter","lastName":"Kaps","id":"37550126100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5293-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-3917-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2325-6532"}],"articleNumber":"5382056","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":69,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":1289},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cryptography","Field programmable gate arrays","Costs","Wireless sensor networks","Information security","National security","Batteries","Pervasive computing","Radiofrequency identification","Power engineering and energy"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["battery powered vehicles","cryptography","field programmable gate arrays","lightweight structures","optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["lightweight cryptography","low-power field programmable gate arrays","battery powered devices","block cipher","Xilinx Spartan3 FPGAs","optimization techniques","AES implementation","HIGHT outperforms"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["HIGHT","Present","FPGA"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5382056","abstract":"The advent of new low-power field programmable gate arrays (FPGA) for battery powered devices opens a host of new applications to FPGAs.

In this paper we propose lightweight cryptography for FPGAs by introducing block cipher independent optimization techniques for Xilinx Spartan3 FPGAs and applying them to the lightweight cryptographic algorithms HIGHT and present. Our implementations are the first reported of these block ciphers on FPGAs. Furthermore, they are the smallest block cipher implementations on FPGAs using only 117 and 91 slices respectively, which makes them comparable in size to stream cipher implementations. Both are less than half the size of the AES implementation by Chodowiec and Gaj without using block RAMs. Present's throughput over area ratio of 240 Kbps/slice is similar to that of AES, however, HIGHT outperforms them by far with 720 Kbps/slice.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5381991","publicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Reconfigurable Computing and FPGAs","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Reconfigurable Computing and FPGAs","pdfPath":"/iel5/5379688/5381991/05382056.pdf","doi":"10.1109/ReConFig.2009.54","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ReConFig.2009.54","startPage":"225","endPage":"230","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Lightweight Cryptography for FPGAs","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"9-11 Dec. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5382056/","displayDocTitle":"Lightweight Cryptography for FPGAs","htmlLink":"/document/5382056/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"9-11 Dec. 2009","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"11073345","dateOfInsertion":"15 January 2010","publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Lightweight Cryptography for FPGAs","confLoc":"Cancun, Mexico","sourcePdf":"3917a225.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072702S","chronDate":"9-11 Dec. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5379688","isNumber":"5381991","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5379688","citationCount":"69","xplore-issue":"5381991","articleId":"5382056","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5382058,"authors":[{"name":"Nathalie Bochard","affiliation":["CNRS Laboratoire Hubert Curien, Universit\u00e9 de Lyon, Saint-Etienne, France"],"firstName":"Nathalie","lastName":"Bochard","id":"37694853300"},{"name":"Florent Bernard","affiliation":["CNRS Laboratoire Hubert Curien, Universit\u00e9 de Lyon, Saint-Etienne, France"],"firstName":"Florent","lastName":"Bernard","id":"37690826500"},{"name":"Viktor Fischer","affiliation":["CNRS Laboratoire Hubert Curien, Universit\u00e9 de Lyon, Saint-Etienne, France"],"firstName":"Viktor","lastName":"Fischer","id":"37325929300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5293-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-3917-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2325-6532"}],"articleNumber":"5382058","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":18,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":685},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Observing the Randomness in RO-Based TRNG","abstract":"The paper deals with true random number generators using a set of ring oscillators as proposed by Sunar et al. in 2007. The original generator has been recently enhanced by Wold and Tan by introducing flip-flops at the output of each ring. We show in the first part of the paper that both original and enhanced architectures have exactly the same behavior when composed of ideal components (they have the same mathematical model), but they have very different behavior in physical devices, as observed by Wold and Tan. However, while reducing the number of rings as they have proposed, the security proof of Sunar et al. does not hold any more. In order to demonstrate that, we will show that the proportion of the pseudo-randomness compared to the true-randomness in the generated random raw signal is much bigger than expected. Our simulation model shows that the generator using more than 18 ideal jitter-free rings having slightly different frequencies and producing thus only pseudo-randomness, will always let the tests pass. We conclude that reducing the number of rings not only makes the security proof of Sunar et al. not hold, but it makes the generator more vulnerable, since the pseudo-randomness is easy to manipulate.","pdfPath":"/iel5/5379688/5381991/05382058.pdf","startPage":"237","endPage":"242","publicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Reconfigurable Computing and FPGAs","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5381991","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ReConFig.2009.57","doi":"10.1109/ReConFig.2009.57","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Reconfigurable Computing and FPGAs","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5382058","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Signal generators","Security","Ring oscillators","Clocks","Frequency","Jitter","Logic devices","Field programmable gate arrays","Random number generation","Entropy"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["flip-flops","oscillators","random number generation","signal generators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["RO-based TRNG","true random number generators","ring oscillators","flip-flops","mathematical model","pseudorandomness","random raw signal","jitter-free rings"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["True Random Number Generators","Jitter","Ring Oscillators","FPGA"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-11 Dec. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5382058/","displayDocTitle":"Observing the Randomness in RO-Based TRNG","accessionNumber":"11073347","dateOfInsertion":"15 January 2010","publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5382058/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"9-11 Dec. 2009","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Observing the Randomness in RO-Based TRNG","confLoc":"Cancun, Mexico","sourcePdf":"3917a237.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048952S","chronDate":"9-11 Dec. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5379688","isNumber":"5381991","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5379688","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"5381991","articleId":"5382058","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5382060,"authors":[{"name":"Mark Hamilton","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University College Cork, Cork, Ireland"],"firstName":"Mark","lastName":"Hamilton","id":"37589911300"},{"name":"William P.

This class of PNG exhibits a correlation between successive values that gives an undesired low-pass characteristic to the generated sequence. This characteristic can affect the simulation results when whiteness of the pseudorandom random sequence is assumed. Several techniques have been proposed to mitigate this deficiency.

Although uniformly distributed pseudorandom number sources can be readily implemented, Gaussian sources are not as easily configured. A typical method is to build a uniform source and transform the distribution to Gaussian. The inversion method accomplishes the transformation by the application of the inverse Gaussian cumulative distribution function (IGCDF). The IGCDF is easily obtained by the use of a look-up table (LUT). However, the memory required for the LUT can become large if it is to accurately represent the IGCDF. In this paper we demonstrate a method that can reduce the size of this LUT while allowing for control of the accuracy.","pdfPath":"/iel5/5379688/5381991/05382071.pdf","startPage":"314","endPage":"319","publicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Reconfigurable Computing and FPGAs","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5381991","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ReConFig.2009.12","doi":"10.1109/ReConFig.2009.12","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Reconfigurable Computing and FPGAs","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5382071","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Table lookup","Hardware","Bit error rate","Digital communication","Electronics packaging","Computational modeling","Distribution functions","Gaussian distribution","Field programmable gate arrays","Character generation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","Gaussian distribution","random number generation","table lookup"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["composite look-up table","Gaussian pseudorandom number generator","digital communication systems","bit error rate","programmable gate array","Gaussian distributed pseudorandom number sources","inverse Gaussian cumulative distribution function","IGCDF","LUT"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Gaussian","Pseudo-Random Number","FPGA"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-11 Dec. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5382071/","displayDocTitle":"Composite Look-Up Table Gaussian Pseudo-Random Number Generator","accessionNumber":"11073330","dateOfInsertion":"15 January 2010","publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5382071/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"9-11 Dec. 2009","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Composite Look-Up Table Gaussian Pseudo-Random Number Generator","confLoc":"Cancun, Mexico","sourcePdf":"3917a314.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.080285S","chronDate":"9-11 Dec. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5379688","isNumber":"5381991","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5379688","xplore-issue":"5381991","articleId":"5382071","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5382082,"authors":[{"name":"Asadollah Shahbahrami","affiliation":["Department of Computer Engineering, University of Guilan, Rasht, Iran","Computer Engineering Laboratory, Delft University of Technnology, Netherlands"],"firstName":"Asadollah","lastName":"Shahbahrami","id":"37398211900"},{"name":"Mahmood Ahmadi","affiliation":["Department of Computer Engineering, Razi University, Kermanshah, Iran","Computer Engineering Laboratory, Delft University of Technnology, Netherlands"],"firstName":"Mahmood","lastName":"Ahmadi","id":"37831820000"},{"name":"Stephan Wong","affiliation":["Computer Engineering Laboratory, Delft University of Technnology, Netherlands"],"firstName":"Stephan","lastName":"Wong","id":"37276110100"},{"name":"Koen Bertels","affiliation":["Computer Engineering Laboratory, Delft University of Technnology, Netherlands"],"firstName":"Koen","lastName":"Bertels","id":"37284722300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5293-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-3917-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2325-6532"}],"articleNumber":"5382082","dbTime":"49 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":105},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Discrete wavelet transforms","Collaboration","Grid computing","Digital signal processing","Application specific integrated circuits","Field programmable gate arrays","Digital signal processors","Graphics","Parallel architectures","Parallel processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["application specific integrated circuits","computer graphics","digital signal processing chips","discrete wavelet transforms","field programmable gate arrays","grid computing","parallel architectures","reconfigurable architectures"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["discrete wavelet transform","reconfigurable elements","digital signal processing","application-specific integrated circuits","field-programmable gate arrays","digital signal processors","general-purpose processors","graphic processors","parallel architecture","grid computing","task level parallelism","2D DWT","flexible platform","hardware accelerators"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["DWT","Grid Computing","Reconfigurable Computing"]}],"abstract":"The discrete wavelet transform (DWT) is an important operation in applications of digital signal processing.

In order to provide both high-performance and flexibility, we propose a new approach, namely a parallel architecture exploiting the collaboration of reconfigurable processing elements in grid computing. Grid computing can exploit the task level parallelism to execute the 2D DWT. In addition, reconfigurable computing offers a flexible platform and can be used as hardware accelerators.

In order to orchestrate this time-multiplexing, temporal partitioning partitions these hardware modules into multiple subsets, each of which fit within the available resources. During a temporal partition transition, the FPGA is reconfigured to the subsequent temporal partition. However, FPGA reconfiguration time can impose significant performance overhead as the entire FPGA fabric must be reconfigured even if only a small portion has changed. Partially reconfigurable (PR) FPGAs can decrease reconfiguration time by only reconfiguring the portions of the FPGA fabric that differ. In this paper, we present a design methodology using a simulated annealing-based module placement optimization engine to minimize FPGA reconfiguration overhead by exploiting module overlap across successive temporal partitions. Experimental results show that our methodology reduces FPGA reconfiguration time by 44% on average.","doi":"10.1109/ReConFig.2009.61","publicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Reconfigurable Computing and FPGAs","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Reconfigurable Computing and FPGAs","pdfPath":"/iel5/5379688/5381991/05382091.pdf","startPage":"374","endPage":"379","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ReConFig.2009.61","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5381991","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5382091","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Runtime Temporal Partitioning Assembly to Reduce FPGA Reconfiguration Time","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-11 Dec. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5382091/","displayDocTitle":"Runtime Temporal Partitioning Assembly to Reduce FPGA Reconfiguration Time","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5382091/","publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"15 January 2010","conferenceDate":"9-11 Dec. 2009","accessionNumber":"11073349","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Runtime Temporal Partitioning Assembly to Reduce FPGA Reconfiguration Time","confLoc":"Cancun, Mexico","sourcePdf":"3917a374.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044077S","chronDate":"9-11 Dec. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5379688","isNumber":"5381991","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5379688","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"5381991","articleId":"5382091","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5382094,"authors":[{"name":"Muhammad Aqeel Wahlah","affiliation":["Computer Engineering, Delft University of Technnology, Netherlands"],"firstName":"Muhammad Aqeel","lastName":"Wahlah","id":"37572053900"},{"name":"Kees Goossens","affiliation":["NXP Semiconductors, Netherlands","Computer Engineering, Delft University of Technnology, Netherlands"],"firstName":"Kees","lastName":"Goossens","id":"37294784500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5293-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-3917-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2325-6532"}],"articleNumber":"5382094","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":54},"abstract":"We envision that future FPGA will use a hardwired network on chip (HWNoC) as a unified interconnect for functional communications (data and control) as well as configuration (bitstream for soft IPs).

In contrast to a synchronously clocked grid studied in research, the design, the implementation, the performance and the resource utilization of an asynchronously clocked grid is shown. Such a run-time reconfigurable (RTR) grid on a FPGA can be utilized to dynamically offload compute functions on a host coupled system, providing multi-user and multi-context execution on behalf of user demands. For embedded systems it can be utilized as a highly dynamical platform by providing functional enhancement by module replacement during run-time. The presented platform leverages synthesis and development constraints and is able to increase the overall throughput by allowing multiple clock domains within the grid. The performance and the additional resource utilization of handling multiple clock domains is compared to synchronously clocked grids. As proof of concept a case study with a grid of 47 RTRMs is conducted on state of the art Virtex-5 FPGAs.","publicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Reconfigurable Computing and FPGAs","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Reconfigurable Computing and FPGAs","pdfPath":"/iel5/5379688/5381991/05382098.pdf","startPage":"392","endPage":"397","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ReConFig.2009.24","doi":"10.1109/ReConFig.2009.24","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5381991","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design and Performance of a Grid of Asynchronously Clocked Run-Time Reconfigurable Modules on a FPGA","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Design and Performance of a Grid of Asynchronously Clocked Run-Time Reconfigurable Modules on a FPGA","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5382098/","conferenceDate":"9-11 Dec. 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5382098/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"15 January 2010","publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","accessionNumber":"11073364","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-11 Dec. 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design and Performance of a Grid of Asynchronously Clocked Run-Time Reconfigurable Modules on a FPGA","confLoc":"Cancun, Mexico","sourcePdf":"3917a392.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.119739S","chronDate":"9-11 Dec. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5379688","isNumber":"5381991","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5379688","xplore-issue":"5381991","articleId":"5382098","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5382103,"authors":[{"name":"Yesid E.

The overall system presents a hardware/software codesign approach and it was achieved by means of a Microblaze FPGA embedded processor and a fuzzy controller, which was implemented directly in hardware. Both the microprocessor and the controller are connected via the Fast Simplex Link - FSL bus. The proposed design methodology involves firstly the fuzzy controller design in software for simulation and testing issues, taking into account the mathematical model of the plant. Afterwards, the controller was synthesized to the hardware description language VHDL using the Xfuzzy 2.0 tool. The fuzzy controller has 2 modules, each one producing a torque control variable. The first module receives both the position and angular speed of the first link of the Acrobot system whereas the second module receives the position and angular speed of the second link. The final torque variable is calculated in the Microblaze taking into account two gains. Each gain represents a priority that is applied to each fuzzy module. These gains were experimentally calculated through several simulation executed in the Matlab computational environment.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fuzzy Control for Cyclist Robot Stability Using FPGAs","doi":"10.1109/ReConFig.2009.53","startPage":"410","endPage":"415","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ReConFig.2009.53","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5381991","publicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Reconfigurable Computing and FPGAs","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Reconfigurable Computing and FPGAs","pdfPath":"/iel5/5379688/5381991/05382103.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5382103","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5382103/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-11 Dec. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Fuzzy Control for Cyclist Robot Stability Using FPGAs","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5382103/","dateOfInsertion":"15 January 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","accessionNumber":"11073376","conferenceDate":"9-11 Dec. 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fuzzy Control for Cyclist Robot Stability Using FPGAs","confLoc":"Cancun, Mexico","sourcePdf":"3917a410.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067117S","chronDate":"9-11 Dec. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5379688","isNumber":"5381991","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5379688","xplore-issue":"5381991","articleId":"5382103","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":5382106,"authors":[{"name":"Diego F.

As compared with a set of LMS DFEs, the proposed scheme can provide better BER and PER performance.","doi":"10.1109/IMPACT.2009.5382290","publicationTitle":"2009 4th International Microsystems, Packaging, Assembly and Circuits Technology Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 4th International Microsystems, Packaging, Assembly and Circuits Technology Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5357591/5382114/05382290.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IMPACT.2009.5382290","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5382114","startPage":"726","endPage":"729","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"MLP/BP-based MIMO DFEs for distorted 16-QAM signal recovery in severe ISI channels with ACI disturbances","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5382290","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"MLP/BP-based MIMO DFEs for distorted 16-QAM signal recovery in severe ISI channels with ACI disturbances","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-23 Oct. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5382290/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"21-23 Oct. 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","accessionNumber":"11101782","dateOfInsertion":"15 January 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5382290/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"MLP/BP-based MIMO DFEs for distorted 16-QAM signal recovery in severe ISI channels with ACI disturbances","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"ProceedingCDRgq.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067003S","chronDate":"21-23 Oct. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5357591","isNumber":"5382114","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5357591","xplore-issue":"5382114","articleId":"5382290","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5382331,"authors":[{"name":"Hang Qin","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Software Engineering, Wuhan University of China, Wuhan, China","Computer School, Yangtze University, Jingzhou, China"],"lastName":"Hang Qin","id":"37402338900"},{"name":"Yanrong Cui","affiliation":["Computer School, Yangtze University, Jingzhou, China"],"lastName":"Yanrong Cui","id":"37851615300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5074-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-5076-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5382331","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":95},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Protocols","Radio spectrum management","Cognitive radio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","protocols","quality of service","radio spectrum management","software radio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["reconfiguration management","cognitive radio network","wireless services","adaptive spectrum coordination protocol","reconfiguration architecture","ASCP protocol","QoS","distributed spectrum etiquette protocol","PHY/MAC","cross-layer capabilities","multi-hop routing"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["cognitive radio","dynamic spectrum","reconfiguration","multi-hop network"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Spectrum Coordination Protocol for reconfiguration management in cognitive radio network","doi":"10.1109/YCICT.2009.5382331","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5382317","endPage":"410","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Youth Conference on Information, Computing and Telecommunication","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Youth Conference on Information, Computing and Telecommunication","pdfPath":"/iel5/5372311/5382317/05382331.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/YCICT.2009.5382331","startPage":"407","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5382331","abstract":"This paper proposes a novel reconfiguration management scheme to dramatically improve spectral efficiency and performance in cognitive radio networks.

The learning scheme starts with no hidden neurons and parsimoniously generates new hidden units according to the proposed growing criteria as learning proceeds. In the parameter learning phase, all free parameters of hidden units are updated by the extended Kalman filter (EKF) method. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed approach can provide faster learning speed and more compact network structure with comparable generalization performance and accuracy.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-21 Sept. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5382344/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11085846","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5382344/","publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"15 January 2010","conferenceDate":"20-21 Sept. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Time-series prediction using self-organizing fuzzy neural networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Time-series prediction using self-organizing fuzzy neural networks","confLoc":"Beijing","sourcePdf":"711.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048456S","chronDate":"20-21 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5372311","isNumber":"5382317","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5372311","xplore-issue":"5382317","articleId":"5382344","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":5382348,"authors":[{"name":"Li Wang","affiliation":["Wireless Signal Process. & Network Lab., Beijing Univ. of Posts & Telecommun., Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Li","lastName":"Wang","id":"38185682700"},{"name":"Hua Jiang","affiliation":["Wireless Signal Process. & Network Lab., Beijing Univ. of Posts & Telecommun., Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Hua","lastName":"Jiang","id":"37087208806"},{"name":"Lan Shao","affiliation":["Wireless Signal Process. & Network Lab., Beijing Univ. of Posts & Telecommun., Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Lan","lastName":"Shao","id":"38100539600"},{"name":"Yicheng Lin","affiliation":["Wireless Signal Process. & Network Lab., Beijing Univ. of Posts & Telecommun., Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yicheng","lastName":"Lin","id":"37087207517"},{"name":"Wenbo Wang","affiliation":["Wireless Signal Process. & Network Lab., Beijing Univ. of Posts & Telecommun., Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Wenbo","lastName":"Wang","id":"37087209744"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5074-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-5076-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5382348","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":45},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5382348","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Signal processing algorithms","Maximum likelihood decoding","Computational complexity","Computational modeling","MIMO","Receiving antennas","Wireless LAN","Laboratories","Wireless communication","Mean square error methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["block codes","computational complexity","decoding","error statistics","orthogonal codes","space-time codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fast sphere decoding","STBC","orthogonal groups","complexity economization","space-time block codes","bit error ratio performance"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["STBC","sphere decoding"]}],"doi":"10.1109/YCICT.2009.5382348","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Youth Conference on Information, Computing and Telecommunication","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Youth Conference on Information, Computing and Telecommunication","pdfPath":"/iel5/5372311/5382317/05382348.pdf","startPage":"355","endPage":"358","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/YCICT.2009.5382348","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5382317","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A fast sphere decoding algorithm fully exploiting the orthogonality of STBC","abstract":"In this paper, we propose a fast sphere decoding (SD) algorithms for the STBCs whose symbols can be decoupled into several orthogonal groups.

Through computer simulation, our proposed algorithm is verified to be better in performance compared to the existing ones.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Youth Conference on Information, Computing and Telecommunication","pdfPath":"/iel5/5372311/5382317/05382373.pdf","startPage":"267","endPage":"270","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Youth Conference on Information, Computing and Telecommunication","doi":"10.1109/YCICT.2009.5382373","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/YCICT.2009.5382373","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5382317","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5382373","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Resource allocation for OFDMA downlink with per-user MCS constraint","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Resource management","Downlink","Laboratories","Modulation coding","Signal processing algorithms","Base stations","Wireless communication","Wireless LAN","Signal processing","Computer simulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["frequency division multiple access","OFDM modulation","resource allocation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["resource allocation","OFDMA downlink","per-user","MCS constraint","modulation and coding scheme","straightforward suboptimal algorithm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["OFDMA","downlink","resource allocation","proportional fairness","per-user MCS constraint"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5382373/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-21 Sept. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Resource allocation for OFDMA downlink with per-user MCS constraint","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5382373/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"11085856","dateOfInsertion":"15 January 2010","conferenceDate":"20-21 Sept. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Resource allocation for OFDMA downlink with per-user MCS constraint","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"595.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.086168S","chronDate":"20-21 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5372311","isNumber":"5382317","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5372311","xplore-issue":"5382317","articleId":"5382373","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5382378,"authors":[{"name":"Yong Gao","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Yong Gao","id":"37085964760"},{"name":"Mu Li","affiliation":["School of Aerospace, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Mu Li","id":"37536975500"},{"name":"Zhen Huang","affiliation":["School of Aerospace, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Zhen Huang","id":"37534233400"},{"name":"Jianhua Lu","affiliation":["School of Aerospace, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Jianhua Lu","id":"37278637500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5074-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-5076-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5382378","dbTime":"27 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":444},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wavelet transforms","Autocorrelation","Frequency estimation","Phase shift keying","Digital modulation","Demodulation","Phase estimation","Time frequency analysis","Robustness","Estimation error"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["correlation methods","demodulation","error statistics","phase shift keying","wavelet transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["symbol rate estimation","Morlet wavelet transform","modulation recognition","phase shift keying","Doppler frequency spread","Cramer-Rao lower bound"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Symbol rate estimation","Morlet wavelet transform","PSK"]}],"abstract":"For modulation recognition and demodulation of non-cooperative digital signals, the symbol rate is an unknown but important parameter.

In orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) systems, this can be done by assigning a subset of orthogonal subcarriers to femtocells. To ensure subcarrier orthogonality and thus not interfere with existing macro Mobile Stations (MSs), the signals from the strongest femtocells should be synchronous with the desired macro signal, otherwise inter carrier interference (ICI) and thus multiple access interference (MAI) will influence macro MS performance. This is likely especially in large macro cells when a macro MS visits a private femtocell far from the macro Base Station (BS). This paper proposes a synchronization scheme where each femto BS first determines its distance d from the macro BS through signaling and then delays its downlink transmission by a d/c relative to the macrocell BS downlink transmission time base, where c is the light speed. The detailed illustrations and simulations are given to validate the scheme.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Interference avoidance in OFDMA-based femtocell network","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Youth Conference on Information, Computing and Telecommunication","doi":"10.1109/YCICT.2009.5382410","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Youth Conference on Information, Computing and Telecommunication","pdfPath":"/iel5/5372311/5382317/05382410.pdf","startPage":"126","endPage":"129","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/YCICT.2009.5382410","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5382317","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5382410","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5382410/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-21 Sept. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Interference avoidance in OFDMA-based femtocell network","conferenceDate":"20-21 Sept. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5382410/","dateOfInsertion":"15 January 2010","publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"11085878","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Interference avoidance in OFDMA-based femtocell network","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"400.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.03819S","chronDate":"20-21 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5372311","isNumber":"5382317","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5372311","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"5382317","articleId":"5382410","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5382413,"authors":[{"name":"Guisen Xu","affiliation":["Communication Research Center, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China"],"lastName":"Guisen Xu","id":"37590193200"},{"name":"Xuezhi Tan","affiliation":["Communication Research Center, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China"],"lastName":"Xuezhi Tan","id":"37290839800"},{"name":"Lin Ma","affiliation":["Communication Research Center, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China"],"lastName":"Lin Ma","id":"37404302600"},{"name":"Anna Auguste Anghuwo","affiliation":["Communication Research Center, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China"],"firstName":"Anna Auguste","lastName":"Anghuwo","id":"37601891700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5074-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-5076-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5382413","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":260},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cognitive radio","Genetic algorithms","Clustering algorithms","Spine","Genetic mutations","Heuristic algorithms","Operations research","Optimization methods","NP-complete problem","Robustness"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","computational complexity","genetic algorithms","set theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio network","multiobjective genetic algorithm","minimum independent dominating set","network construction design","multiobjective MIDS","heuristic algorithm search","multiobjective optimization problem","NP-hard problem","mutation operators","crossover operators"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cognitive radio network","network configuration","minimum independent dominating set","genetic algorithm","Pareto optimal set"]}],"abstract":"Cognitive radio network technology brings a novel approach to share the open spectrum flexibly and efficiently. However, how to further improve the network construction for reducing the redundant information has become the hot topic. Minimum independent dominating set (MIDS) in graphs is a classic problem in operations research with important application in network construction design. The single objective MIDS (SMIDS) problem can be solved efficiently, but the degree constrained and multi-objective versions are NP-hard. In this paper, according to the characteristics of cognitive radio network nods, an improved genetic algorithm (GA) with special crossover and mutation operators is proposed to solve the problem. Experimental results showed that the proposed method for searching multi-objective MIDS (MMIDS) with improved GA outperforms the conventional methods with heuristic algorithm search in multi-objective optimization problem. And it was therefore effectively able to select the clusters for different network simulation scenarios.","doi":"10.1109/YCICT.2009.5382413","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Youth Conference on Information, Computing and Telecommunication","pdfPath":"/iel5/5372311/5382317/05382413.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5382317","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/YCICT.2009.5382413","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Youth Conference on Information, Computing and Telecommunication","startPage":"122","endPage":"125","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A construction algorithm of cognitive radio network with multiobjective genetic algorithm","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5382413","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-21 Sept. 2009","displayDocTitle":"A construction algorithm of cognitive radio network with multiobjective genetic algorithm","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5382413/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5382413/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"11118835","dateOfInsertion":"15 January 2010","conferenceDate":"20-21 Sept. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A construction algorithm of cognitive radio network with multiobjective genetic algorithm","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"397.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068334S","chronDate":"20-21 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5372311","isNumber":"5382317","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5372311","xplore-issue":"5382317","articleId":"5382413","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5382415,"authors":[{"name":"Xie Xiaochun","affiliation":["School of Physics and Electronic Information, Gannan Normal University, Ganzhou, China"],"lastName":"Xie Xiaochun"},{"name":"Guan Lixin","affiliation":["School of Physics and Electronic Information, Gannan Normal University, Ganzhou, China"],"lastName":"Guan Lixin"},{"name":"Lu Zhenhui","affiliation":["School of Physics and Electronic Information, Gannan Normal University, Ganzhou, China"],"lastName":"Lu Zhenhui"},{"name":"Lai Zhaoshen","affiliation":["School of Physics and Electronic Information, Gannan Normal University, Ganzhou, China"],"lastName":"Lai Zhaoshen"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5074-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-5076-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5382415","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":261},"abstract":"In this paper, we propose a new video encoding algorithm based compressive sensing theory. The video encoding framework combines the BSHE and GPSR algorithm. The number of samples needed in new encoding algorithm, which can be changed according to encoding mode, is smaller than in traditional method. Encoder works as a projector that project high dimensional signals to a low dimensional domain, while decoder works for the solution of an underdetermined system of equations. So decoder is more complex than encoder, and the process of decoding is no longer the inverse process of encoding. Compared with the traditional codec, the new codec is simple, although high compression ration and good quality of reconstructed video are obtained.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Youth Conference on Information, Computing and Telecommunication","pdfPath":"/iel5/5372311/5382317/05382415.pdf","startPage":"114","endPage":"117","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Youth Conference on Information, Computing and Telecommunication","doi":"10.1109/YCICT.2009.5382415","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/YCICT.2009.5382415","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5382317","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5382415","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fast encoding of video based on compressive sensing","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Encoding","Video compression","Decoding","Image reconstruction","Sampling methods","Codecs","Streaming media","Video coding","IEEE members","Physics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["video codecs","video coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["video encoding algorithm","compressive sensing theory","video codecs","scrambled block hadamard ensemble","gradient projection for sparse reconstruction"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Video Codecs","Encoding","Compressive Sensing","Scrambled Block Hadamard Ensemble","Gradient Projection for Sparse Reconstruction"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5382415/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-21 Sept. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Fast encoding of video based on compressive sensing","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5382415/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"11118837","dateOfInsertion":"15 January 2010","conferenceDate":"20-21 Sept. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fast encoding of video based on compressive sensing","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"389.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052943S","chronDate":"20-21 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5372311","isNumber":"5382317","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5372311","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5382317","articleId":"5382415","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5382418,"authors":[{"name":"Boyi Ni","affiliation":["Department of Automation, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Boyi Ni","id":"37087253892"},{"name":"Deyun Xiao","affiliation":["Department of Automation, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Deyun Xiao","id":"37087148461"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5074-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-5076-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5382418","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":65},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5382418","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Spectral analysis","Sampling methods","Nonuniform sampling","Signal processing","Frequency","Automation","Sampled data systems","System identification","Control systems","Data acquisition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Nyquist diagrams","random processes","sampled data systems","signal sampling","spectral analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["uniformly sampled data","spectral information","Nyquist rate","nonuniform sampling pattern","aliased signal","finite data sets","system identifiability","nonuniform samples","spectral analysis","random distributions","model error bounds"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Identification","sampled data systems","antialiasing","spectral analysis"]}],"abstract":"The system identifiability for sparse and nonuniform measurements is addressed.

In this paper a model is presented for calculating the noise cross spectral matrix of such an array, thus array gain computation and weighting vector design for supergain beamformer can incorporate the baffle scatter effects by using the exact noise cross spectral matrix. However, supergain beamformer may be extremely sensitive to slight errors in array characteristics. Therefore, a new robust supergain beamforming method in mode space which adopts the white noise constraint and low mode orders under low frequencies is also presented.

In this paper, we introduce an evaluation method and analyze optical-device-based QKD networks including two rational aspects: (i) network connectivity and network bandwidth which reflect the network's flexibility and performance in theory; (ii) network cost that brings pragmatic restriction on the network construction in practice. Applying this model, we compare five typical types of optical-device-based QKD networks.

In order to achieve higher flexibility, the MHS makes use of a decentralized navigation control, which increases autonomy and scalability, and a distributed Petri net for solving task allocation and traffic control problems. In order to facilitate the integration with the manufacturing processes, tasks dispatched by manufacturing cells are allocated by the MHS itself, taking into account pending transportation tasks and the system's performance.

The real component of a constantly rotating vector and a low-frequency band-limited vector, which is linearized by Taylor series, is employed to model supplied signals in power systems. And dynamic characteristics of power systems are described in form of Taylor series' derivatives, which are calculated through consecutive phasors. The accuracy of phasor estimation was dramatically improved by the reassignment of estimation of short-time Fourier transform (STFT) with knowledge of these derivatives. Simulation results allow us to make the conclusion that the proposed algorithm improves the accuracy of phasor estimations under dynamic conditions dramatically, such as frequency ramping, low frequency oscillation, etc., at the cost of the calculation burden is a minimal increase whilst still meeting the requirements of the application for power systems.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","pdfPath":"/iel5/61/5437451/05382494.pdf","startPage":"570","endPage":"578","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","doi":"10.1109/TPWRD.2009.2034293","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPWRD.2009.2034293","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5437451","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5382494","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Dynamic Synchrophasor Estimation Algorithm for Online Application","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Heuristic algorithms","Power system dynamics","Frequency estimation","Phasor measurement units","Adaptive filters","Power system simulation","Power system reliability","Filtering","Power system modeling","Fourier transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Fourier transforms","frequency estimation","phase measurement","power system faults","power system measurement","power system state estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dynamic synchrophasor estimation algorithm","online application","constantly rotating vector","low-frequency band-limited vector","Taylor series","power systems dynamic characteristics","phasor estimation","short-time Fourier transform","STFT","low frequency oscillation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Finite impulse response (FIR) filter","frequency deviation","phasor measurement units (PMUs)","power system oscillation","short-time Fourier transform (STFT)","synchrophasor","Taylor series","total vector error (TVE)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5382494/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 January 2010","displayDocTitle":"A Dynamic Synchrophasor Estimation Algorithm for Online Application","volume":"25","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/5382494/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2010","accessionNumber":"11204429","dateOfInsertion":"22 March 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Dynamic Synchrophasor Estimation Algorithm for Online Application","sourcePdf":"tpwrd-mai-2034293.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.107503S","chronDate":"April  2010","xplore-pub-id":"61","isNumber":"5437451","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"61","citationCount":"116","xplore-issue":"5437451","articleId":"5382494","onlineDate":"15 January 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5382495,"authors":[{"name":"Shoushun Chen","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, Singapore"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/92/5735629/5382495/5382495-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Shoushun Chen (M'08) received the B.S. degree from Peking University, Peking, China, the M.E. degree from Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China, and the Ph.D. degree from Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong, in 2000, 2003 and 2007, respectively.","He held a Postdoctoral Research Fellowship with the Department of Electronic and Computer Engineering, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology for one year after graduation.

The network performances are investigated over a 500-MHz frequency bandwidth ranging from 12.25 to 12.75 GHz. The matrix definition based on SIW cruciform couplers is similar to its microstrip counterpart in terms of coupling factors and phase delays. The whole network is fabricated.

Most network reliability optimization problems are only focused on solving simple structured networks (e.g., series-parallel networks) of which the reliability function can be easily obtained in advance. However, modern networks are usually very complex, and it is impossible to calculate the exact network reliability function by using traditional analytical methods in limited time. Hence, a new particle swarm optimization (PSO) based on Monte Carlo simulation (MCS), named MCS-PSO, has been proposed to solve complex network reliability optimization problems. The proposed MCS-PSO can minimize cost under reliability constraints. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to use PSO combined with MCS to solve complex network reliability problems without requiring knowledge of the reliability function in advance. Compared with previous works to solve this problem, the proposed MCS-PSO can have better efficiency by providing a better solution to the complex network reliability optimization problem.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5382503/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 January 2010","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11152835","volume":"59","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/5382503/","publicationDate":"March 2010","dateOfInsertion":"01 March 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A Particle Swarm Optimization Approach Based on Monte Carlo Simulation for Solving the Complex Network Reliability Problem","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Particle Swarm Optimization Approach Based on Monte Carlo Simulation for Solving the Complex Network Reliability Problem","sourcePdf":"tr-yeh-2035796.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.131984S","chronDate":"March  2010","xplore-pub-id":"24","isNumber":"5423274","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"24","citationCount":"74","xplore-issue":"5423274","articleId":"5382503","onlineDate":"15 January 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-10"},{"_id":5382507,"authors":[{"name":"Norman Hopfe","affiliation":["Institute of Mathematics, Technical University Ilmenau, Ilmenau, Germany"],"firstName":"Norman","lastName":"Hopfe","id":"37973283400"},{"name":"Achim Ilchmann","affiliation":["Institute of Mathematics, Technical University Ilmenau, Ilmenau, Germany"],"firstName":"Achim","lastName":"Ilchmann","id":"37299275700"},{"name":"Eugene P.

Most DLAs presented earlier, for example ILS-DLA and K-SVD, update the dictionary after a batch of training vectors has been processed, usually using the whole set of training vectors as one batch. The training set is used iteratively to gradually improve the dictionary. The approach in RLS-DLA is a continuous update of the dictionary as each training vector is being processed. The core of the algorithm is compact and can be effectively implemented. The algorithm is derived very much along the same path as the recursive least squares (RLS) algorithm for adaptive filtering. Thus, as in RLS, a forgetting factor \u00bf can be introduced and easily implemented in the algorithm. Adjusting \u00bf in an appropriate way makes the algorithm less dependent on the initial dictionary and it improves both convergence properties of RLS-DLA as well as the representation ability of the resulting dictionary. Two sets of experiments are done to test different methods for learning dictionaries. The goal of the first set is to explore some basic properties of the algorithm in a simple setup, and for the second set it is the reconstruction of a true underlying dictionary. The first experiment confirms the conjectural properties from the derivation part, while the second demonstrates excellent performance.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Recursive Least Squares Dictionary Learning Algorithm","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2010.2040671","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/5427215/05382523.pdf","startPage":"2121","endPage":"2130","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2010.2040671","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5427215","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5382523","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5382523/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 January 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2010","displayDocTitle":"Recursive Least Squares Dictionary Learning Algorithm","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"58","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/5382523/","dateOfInsertion":"08 March 2010","publicationDate":"April 2010","accessionNumber":"11168882","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Recursive Least Squares Dictionary Learning Algorithm","sourcePdf":"58tsp04-kskretting-2040671.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.109513S","chronDate":"April  2010","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"5427215","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"251","xplore-issue":"5427215","articleId":"5382523","onlineDate":"15 January 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5382524,"authors":[{"name":"Hamsakutty Vettikalladi","affiliation":["Institute of Electronics and Telecommunication of Rennes (IETR), University of Rennes I, Rennes, France"],"firstName":"Hamsakutty","lastName":"Vettikalladi","id":"37542347700"},{"name":"Olivier Lafond","affiliation":["Institute of Electronics and Telecommunication of Rennes (IETR), University of Rennes I, Rennes, France"],"firstName":"Olivier","lastName":"Lafond","id":"37318751800"},{"name":"Mohammed Himdi","affiliation":["Institute of Electronics and Telecommunication of Rennes (IETR), University of Rennes I, Rennes, France"],"firstName":"Mohammed","lastName":"Himdi","id":"37278796200"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1536-1225"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1548-5757"}],"articleNumber":"5382524","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":122,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":3313},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society","url":"http://www.ieeeaps.org/"}],"abstract":"A high-efficient and high-gain aperture coupled patch antenna with superstrate at 60 GHz is studied and presented. It is noted that adding superstrate will result in a significant effect on the antenna performances, and the size of the superstrate is critical for the optimum performance. The maximum measured gain of a single antenna with superstrate is 14.6 dBi, which is higher than that of a classical 2 x 2 array. It is found that the gain measured of a single antenna with superstrate increases nearly 9 dB at 60 GHz over its basic patch antenna. This superstrate antenna gives a very high estimated efficiency of 76%. The 2:1 measured VSWR bandwidth with superstrate is 6.8%. The radiation patterns are found to be broadside all over the frequency band. Also, this letter explains a comparison to another source of parasitic patch superstrate antenna with normal microstrip coupling.

At the source node, a serially concatenated scheme comprising an IRregular Convolutional Code (IRCC), a recursive unity-rate code (URC), and a space-time block code (STBC) was designed for the sake of approaching the corresponding source-to-relay link capacity, where the IRCC was optimized with the aid of EXtrinsic Information Transfer (EXIT) charts. At the relay node, another IRCC is serially concatenated with an identical STBC. Before transmitting the relayed information, the relay's IRCC is reoptimized based on EXIT chart analysis for the sake of approaching the relay channel's capacity and to maximize the relay's coding rate, which results in a maximized effective throughput. We will demonstrate that the topology of the Ir-DST system coincides with that of a distributed turbo code (DTC). At the destination node, a novel three-stage iterative decoding scheme is constructed to achieve decoding convergence to an infinitesimally low bit-error ratio (BER). Finally, our numerical results show the proficiency of our joint source-and-relay mode design procedure, demonstrating that the proposed Ir-DST coding scheme is capable of near-capacity cooperative communications and of maximizing the effective throughput.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2010.2040398","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/5431116/05382526.pdf","startPage":"1511","endPage":"1517","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5431116","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2010.2040398","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5382526","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Maximum-Throughput Irregular Distributed Space-Time Code for Near-Capacity Cooperative Communications","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5382526/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 January 2010","displayDocTitle":"Maximum-Throughput Irregular Distributed Space-Time Code for Near-Capacity Cooperative Communications","volume":"59","issue":"3","accessionNumber":"11177555","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"15 March 2010","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5382526/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Maximum-Throughput Irregular Distributed Space-Time Code for Near-Capacity Cooperative Communications","sourcePdf":"tvt-hanzo-2040398.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.093303S","chronDate":"March  2010","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"5431116","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"25","xplore-issue":"5431116","articleId":"5382526","onlineDate":"15 January 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5382529,"authors":[{"name":"Hui Yu","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Shanghai Jiaotong University, Shanghai, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/5463253/5382529/5382529-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Hui Yu received the B.S. degree from the Department of Electrical Engineering, Tong Ji University, Shanghai, China, in 1992 and the M.S. degree from the Department of Electronic Engineering, Shanghai Jiao Tong University in 1997.","He is currently a lecturer with the Department of Electronic Engineering, Shanghai Jiao Tong University."]},"firstName":"Hui","lastName":"Yu","id":"37401022100"},{"name":"Lin Gao","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Shanghai Jiaotong University, Shanghai, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/5463253/5382529/5382529-photo-2-source-small.gif","p":["Lin Gao received the B.S. degree in information engineering from Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Nanjing, China, in 2002 and the M.S. degree in electronic engineering from Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China, in 2006.

The bounded component analysis of the observations relies on the hypotheses of compactness and Cartesian decomposition of the convex support of the vector of component signals, and in the invertibility of the mixture. Assumptions, which in absence of noise, are able to guarantee the identifiability of the mixture and separability of the components, up to permutation, scaling, and phase ambiguities. Under these conditions, the convex perimeter of the normalized linear combination of the observations is shown to be a global contrast function whose minima correspond with the extraction of bounded components of the observations. Practical extraction and separation algorithms based on the minimization of this criterion are given. The experimental results with communications signals serve to illustrate the good performance of the proposed method in high SNR scenarios, even for a small number of samples.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2010.2040685","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/5427215/05382534.pdf","startPage":"2141","endPage":"2154","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2010.2040685","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5427215","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Bounded Component Analysis of Linear Mixtures: A Criterion of Minimum Convex Perimeter","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5382534","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 January 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5382534/","displayDocTitle":"Bounded Component Analysis of Linear Mixtures: A Criterion of Minimum Convex Perimeter","volume":"58","issue":"4","publicationDate":"April 2010","accessionNumber":"11168870","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5382534/","dateOfInsertion":"08 March 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Bounded Component Analysis of Linear Mixtures: A Criterion of Minimum Convex Perimeter","sourcePdf":"58tsp04-scruces-2040685.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.076323S","chronDate":"April  2010","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"5427215","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"55","xplore-issue":"5427215","articleId":"5382534","onlineDate":"15 January 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5382535,"authors":[{"name":"Raman Arora","affiliation":["University of Wisconsin, Seattle, WA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/5446566/5382535/5382535-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Raman Arora (M'07) received the B.Eng. degree in electronics and communication engineering from Netaji Subhas Institute of Technology, New Delhi, India, in 2001, and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from University of Wisconsin-Madison in 2005 and 2009, respectively.","He is currently a Postdoctoral Research Associate with the Electrical Engineering Department, University of Washington, Seattle.

The data is collected on a manifold which forms a homogeneous space under the transitive action of a compact Lie group. Signal estimation problems are addressed by formulating Wiener-Hopf equations for homogeneous spaces. The coefficient functions of these equations are the signal correlations which are assumed to be known. The resulting coupled integral equations on the manifold are converted to Wiener-Hopf convolutional integral equations on the group. These are solved using the Peter-Weyl theory of Fourier transform on compact Lie groups. The computational complexity of this algorithm is reduced using the bi-invariance of the correlations with respect to a stabilizer subgroup. The theory of matched filtering for isotropic signal fields is developed for signal classification where given a set of template signals on the manifold and a noisy test signal, the objective is to optimally detect the template buried in the test signal. This is accomplished by designing a filter on the manifold that maximizes the signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) of the filtered output. An expression for the SNR is obtained as a ratio of quadratic forms expressed as Haar integrals over the transformation group. These integrals are expressed in the Fourier domain as infinite sums over the irreducible representations. Simplification of these sums is achieved by invariance properties of the signal function and the noise correlation function. The Wiener filter and matched filter are developed for an abstract homogeneous space and then specialized to the case of spherical signals under the action of the rotation group. Applications of these algorithms to denoising of 3D surface data, visual navigation with omnidirectional camera and detection of compact embedded objects in the stochastic background are discussed with experimental results.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2010.2040687","startPage":"2623","endPage":"2635","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2010.2040687","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5446566","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/5446566/05382535.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal Estimation and Detection in Homogeneous Spaces","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5382535/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Optimal Estimation and Detection in Homogeneous Spaces","volume":"58","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/5382535/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11228726","publicationDate":"May 2010","dateOfInsertion":"12 April 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 January 2010","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal Estimation and Detection in Homogeneous Spaces","sourcePdf":"58tsp04-rarora-2040687.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.104016S","chronDate":"May  2010","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"5446566","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"5446566","articleId":"5382535","onlineDate":"15 January 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5382536,"authors":[{"name":"Ezra Ip","affiliation":["NEC Laboratories of America, Inc., Princeton, NJ, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Ezra Ip received the B.E. degree (with honors) in electrical and electronics engineering from the University of Canterbury, Christchurch, New Zealand, in 2002, and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from Stanford University, Stanford, CA, in 2004 and 2008, respectively.","He is currently a member of the Research Staff at NEC Laboratories America, Princeton, NJ, where he is engaged in research on coherent optical systems, nonlinear signal processing, and submarine fiber systems.

Because these coding schemes require the use of a feedback channel, we evaluate the bandwidth cost incurred. The evaluation of the codes is performed offline and uses experimental optical signals recorded from an FSO link. We analyze the temporal characteristics of the experimental channels and compare the performance of the codes for different bit rates to asses the effect of temporal correlation and imperfect channel state information.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5382537/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 January 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"April1,  2010","publicationDate":"April1, 2010","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5382537/","dateOfInsertion":"04 March 2010","accessionNumber":"11156417","volume":"28","issue":"7","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Rateless Coding on Experimental Temporally Correlated FSO Channels","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Rateless Coding on Experimental Temporally Correlated FSO Channels","sourcePdf":"jlt-anguita-2040136.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.089177S","chronDate":"April1,  2010","xplore-pub-id":"50","isNumber":"5423316","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"48","xplore-issue":"5423316","articleId":"5382537","onlineDate":"15 January 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5382539,"authors":[{"name":"Chih-Ming Kuo","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Sun Yat-Sen University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chih-Ming","lastName":"Kuo","id":"37963721600"},{"name":"Chih-Wen Kuo","affiliation":["Institute of Communications Engineering and Department of Electrical Engineering, National Sun Yat-Sen University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chih-Wen","lastName":"Kuo","id":"37279591200"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1536-1225"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1548-5757"}],"articleNumber":"5382539","dbTime":"15 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":559},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society","url":"http://www.ieeeaps.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Finite difference methods","Radar cross section","Time domain analysis","Magnetic fields","Equations","Electrical capacitance tomography","Geometry","Numerical simulation","Numerical stability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["finite difference time-domain analysis","radar cross-sections"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FDTD method","radar cross section calculation","perfect conducting curved objects","conformal finite-difference time-domain method","time-step reduction","RCS calculation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Conformal finite-difference time-domain (CFDTD) method","radar cross section (RCS)","time-step reduction"]}],"abstract":"The chief shortcoming of the conformal finite-difference time-domain (CFDTD) method is the global time-step reduction in order to avoid instability arising from small irregular cells.

The time-step reduction is applied only locally to the small irregular cells, which is only 1/3 of that in the regular cells. In order to update the electric field at the interface between the small irregular cell and its adjacent cells, extra magnetic fields next to the small irregular cell are introduced. Through this scheme, the time-step reduction is limited to a few small cells, and the numerical simulation can be the most efficiently implemented in the FDTD framework. Numerical accuracy is verified by comparison with the conventional CFDTD method for the radar cross section (RCS) of perfect conducting curved objects.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A New Scheme for the Conformal FDTD Method to Calculate the Radar Cross Section of Perfect Conducting Curved Objects","publicationTitle":"IEEE Antennas and Wireless Propagation Letters","doi":"10.1109/LAWP.2010.2040572","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Antennas and Wireless Propagation Letters","pdfPath":"/iel5/7727/5423326/05382539.pdf","startPage":"16","endPage":"19","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LAWP.2010.2040572","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5423326","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5382539","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5382539/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 January 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"2010","displayDocTitle":"A New Scheme for the Conformal FDTD Method to Calculate the Radar Cross Section of Perfect Conducting Curved Objects","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"9","htmlLink":"/document/5382539/","dateOfInsertion":"04 March 2010","publicationDate":"2010","accessionNumber":"11156339","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A New Scheme for the Conformal FDTD Method to Calculate the Radar Cross Section of Perfect Conducting Curved Objects","sourcePdf":"lawp-ckuo-2040572.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.046926S","chronDate":"2010","xplore-pub-id":"7727","isNumber":"5423326","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7727","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"5423326","articleId":"5382539","onlineDate":"15 January 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5382546,"authors":[{"name":"Giuseppe Addamo","affiliation":["Istituto di Elettronica ed Ingegneria dell'Informazione e delle Telecomunicazioni (IEIIT-CNR), Politecnico di Torino, Turin, Italy"],"firstName":"Giuseppe","lastName":"Addamo","id":"37303277900"},{"name":"Oscar Antonio Peverini","affiliation":["Istituto di Elettronica ed Ingegneria dell'Informazione e delle Telecomunicazioni (IEIIT-CNR), Politecnico di Torino, Turin, Italy"],"firstName":"Oscar Antonio","lastName":"Peverini","id":"37295344400"},{"name":"Riccardo Tascone","affiliation":["Istituto di Elettronica ed Ingegneria dell'Informazione e delle Telecomunicazioni (IEIIT-CNR), Politecnico di Torino, Turin, Italy"],"firstName":"Riccardo","lastName":"Tascone","id":"37268992300"},{"name":"Giuseppe Virone","affiliation":["Istituto di Elettronica ed Ingegneria dell'Informazione e delle Telecomunicazioni (IEIIT-CNR), Politecnico di Torino, Turin, Italy"],"firstName":"Giuseppe","lastName":"Virone","id":"37300200200"},{"name":"Pierluigi Cecchini","affiliation":["Thales Alenia Space, Rome, Italy"],"firstName":"Pierluigi","lastName":"Cecchini","id":"37303277700"},{"name":"Renato Orta","affiliation":["Istituto di Elettronica ed Ingegneria dell'Informazione e delle Telecomunicazioni (IEIIT-CNR), Politecnico di Torino, Turin, Italy"],"firstName":"Renato","lastName":"Orta","id":"37271150600"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1536-1225"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1548-5757"}],"articleNumber":"5382546","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":11,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":736},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society","url":"http://www.ieeeaps.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5382546","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Dual band","Satellite communication","Satellite broadcasting","Artificial satellites","Geometry","Cutoff frequency","Design optimization","Optical waveguides","K-band","Antenna measurements"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["horn antennas","microwave antennas","multifrequency antennas","optimisation","satellite communication","telecommunication services"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Ku band","K band","satellite services","optimization technique","satellite communications","compact dual-band circular corrugated horn","horn geometry"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Bloch wave","circular corrugated horn","power handling","satellite communication"]}],"doi":"10.1109/LAWP.2010.2040573","publicationTitle":"IEEE Antennas and Wireless Propagation Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Antennas and Wireless Propagation Letters","pdfPath":"/iel5/7727/4808186/05382546.pdf","startPage":"1418","endPage":"1421","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LAWP.2010.2040573","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4808186","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Ku-K Dual-Band Compact Circular Corrugated Horn for Satellite Communications","abstract":"The design of a compact dual-band circular corrugated horn for satellite services in the Ku/K-bands is presented in this letter.

Using the fact that the motor parameters are nonlinear and significantly vary with direct and quadrature current operating points, a new optimal operating plane is generated. This operating plane combines the maximum torque per ampere (MTPA) curve, current limit circle, and maximum torque per volt (MTPV) curve, voltage limitations, and torque calculation under the nonlinear parameter variations. As a result, new feedforward tables are generated, which make full use of measured motor parameters. The new torque and flux regulators built around the feedforward tables provide a fast dynamic response and accurate steady-state torque/power production.

The proposed design provides a flexible framework, where new LDCs attaining higher data rates and better error resilience than a number of classic MIMO schemes can be generated.","doi":"10.1109/LSP.2010.2040652","publicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Letters","pdfPath":"/iel5/97/5429002/05382553.pdf","startPage":"497","endPage":"500","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LSP.2010.2040652","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5429002","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Unitary Linear Dispersion Code Design and Optimization for MIMO Communication Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5382553","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 January 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5382553/","displayDocTitle":"Unitary Linear Dispersion Code Design and Optimization for MIMO Communication Systems","volume":"17","issue":"5","publicationDate":"May 2010","accessionNumber":"11205686","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5382553/","dateOfInsertion":"29 March 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Unitary Linear Dispersion Code Design and Optimization for MIMO Communication Systems","sourcePdf":"lsp-jiang-2040652.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.05158S","chronDate":"May  2010","xplore-pub-id":"97","isNumber":"5429002","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"97","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"5429002","articleId":"5382553","onlineDate":"15 January 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5382555,"authors":[{"name":"Michel Daoud Yacoub","affiliation":["Wireless Technology Laboratory, Department of Communications, School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, State University of Campinas, Sao Paulo, Brazil"],"firstName":"Michel Daoud","lastName":"Yacoub","id":"37272286500"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9545"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1939-9359"}],"articleNumber":"5382555","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":44,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":841},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Vehicular Technology Society","url":"http://www.vtsociety.org/"}],"abstract":"The aim of this paper is to propose an improvement on the Nakagami-\n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">m</i>\n complex signal model presented elsewhere in the literature.

We develop an accurate characterization of estimation errors as well as errors due to feedback delay, and tools relevant for deriving analytical expressions for the PEP. The modeling highlights the distinction between errors that arise due to channel estimation from those that arise due to feedback delay and represents an important departure from past work.

Although various kinds of low-complexity quasi-optimal iterative decoding algorithms have been proposed, the VLSI implementation of nonbinary LDPC decoders has rarely been discussed due to their hardware unfriendly properties. In this brief, an efficient selective computation algorithm, which totally avoids the sorting process, is proposed for Min-Max decoding. In addition, an efficient VLSI architecture for a nonbinary Min-Max decoder is presented. The synthesis results are given to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed techniques.","doi":"10.1109/TCSII.2009.2036542","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSII.2009.2036542","startPage":"51","endPage":"55","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs","pdfPath":"/iel5/8920/5393271/05382559.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5393271","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Efficient VLSI Architecture for Nonbinary LDPC Decoders","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5382559/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 January 2010","displayDocTitle":"An Efficient VLSI Architecture for Nonbinary LDPC Decoders","volume":"57","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2010","accessionNumber":"11071225","publicationDate":"Jan. 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5382559/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Efficient VLSI Architecture for Nonbinary LDPC Decoders","sourcePdf":"tcsii-lin-2036542.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.109005S","chronDate":"Jan.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"8920","isNumber":"5393271","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8920","citationCount":"31","xplore-issue":"5393271","articleId":"5382559","onlineDate":"15 January 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5382561,"authors":[{"name":"Cheng-De Zheng","affiliation":["Department of Mathematics, Dalian Jiaotong University, Dalian, China"],"firstName":"Cheng-De","lastName":"Zheng","id":"37290288300"},{"name":"Huaguang Zhang","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Engineering, Northeastern University, Shenyang, China"],"firstName":"Huaguang","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37280792300"},{"name":"Zhanshan Wang","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Engineering, Northeastern University, Shenyang, China"],"firstName":"Zhanshan","lastName":"Wang","id":"37291899000"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1549-7747"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-3791"}],"articleNumber":"5382561","dbTime":"37 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":32,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":351},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Circuits and Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieee-cas.org/"}],"abstract":"Uniqueness and robust exponential stability are analyzed for a class of uncertain cellular neural networks with time-varying delays.

The line-to-ground fault can cause significant dc-link neutral voltage and can therefore be effectively detected and located through monitoring the dc-link midpoint voltage without extra hardware. The inner device short in the three-level phase leg can lead to dc-link voltage imbalance and doubling the stress on capacitors and devices, which must be suppressed for the safe operation of the converter. Two overvoltage-limiting methods are proposed to limit the overvoltage. The design of both ground fault detection and overvoltage limiting has been covered in the paper. The schemes are verified through simulation and experiments.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Failure analysis","Protection","Pulse width modulation","Pulse width modulation converters","Fault detection","Voltage control","Condition monitoring","Hardware","Leg","Stress"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fault diagnosis","power system protection","PWM power convertors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["failure mode analysis","protection","three-level neutral-point-clamped","PWM voltage source converters","line-to-ground fault","dc-link midpoint voltage","overvoltage-limiting methods","ground fault detection"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Failure modes","fault detection","protection","three-level neutral-point-clamped (NPC) converter"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TIA.2010.2040058","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/28/5433727/05382562.pdf","startPage":"866","endPage":"874","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5433727","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIA.2010.2040058","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Failure-Mode Analysis and Protection of Three-Level Neutral-Point-Clamped PWM Voltage Source Converters","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5382562","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Failure-Mode Analysis and Protection of Three-Level Neutral-Point-Clamped PWM Voltage Source Converters","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5382562/","volume":"46","issue":"2","publicationDate":"March-april 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5382562/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"11204109","dateOfInsertion":"18 March 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"March-april  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 January 2010","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Failure-Mode Analysis and Protection of Three-Level Neutral-Point-Clamped PWM Voltage Source Converters","sourcePdf":"tia-wang-2040058.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.069569S","chronDate":"March-april  2010","xplore-pub-id":"28","isNumber":"5433727","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"28","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"5433727","articleId":"5382562","onlineDate":"15 January 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":5382563,"authors":[{"name":"Dong-Eok Kim","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/5410131/5382563/5382563-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Dong-Eok Kim (S'07) received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in electrical engineering from Yeungnam University, Gyeongbuk, Korea, in 2005 and 2008, respectively.

Unlike contemporary strategies, the envisioned scheme avoids flooding the considered vehicular network with high volumes of emergency messages upon accidental events. We present a cluster-based organization of the target vehicles. The cluster is based upon several criteria, which define the movement of the vehicles, namely, the directional bearing and relative velocity of each vehicle, as well as the inter-vehicular distance. We also design a risk-aware medium-access control (MAC) protocol to increase the responsiveness of the proposed CCA scheme. According to the order of each vehicle in its corresponding cluster, an emergency level is associated with the vehicle that signifies the risk of encountering a potential emergency scenario. To swiftly circulate the emergency notifications to collocated vehicles to mitigate the risk of chain collisions, the medium-access delay of each vehicle is set as a function of its emergency level. Due to its twofold contributions, i.e., the cluster-based and risk-conscious approaches, our adopted strategy is referred to as the cluster-based risk-aware CCA (C-RACCA) scheme. The performance of the C-RACCA system is verified through mathematical analyses and computer simulations, whose results clearly verify its effectiveness in mitigating collision risks of the vehicles arising from accidental hazards.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2010.2040639","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/5431116/05382585.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2010.2040639","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5431116","startPage":"1474","endPage":"1486","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Toward an Effective Risk-Conscious and Collaborative Vehicular Collision Avoidance System","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5382585","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Toward an Effective Risk-Conscious and Collaborative Vehicular Collision Avoidance System","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5382585/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 January 2010","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"59","issue":"3","publicationDate":"March 2010","accessionNumber":"11177537","dateOfInsertion":"15 March 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5382585/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Toward an Effective Risk-Conscious and Collaborative Vehicular Collision Avoidance System","sourcePdf":"tvt-taleb-2040639.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.085237S","chronDate":"March  2010","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"5431116","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"104","xplore-issue":"5431116","articleId":"5382585","onlineDate":"15 January 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5382589,"authors":[{"name":"Alan Tennant","affiliation":["Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University of Sheffield, Sheffield, UK"],"firstName":"Alan","lastName":"Tennant","id":"37277283100"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-926X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2221"}],"articleNumber":"5382589","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":96,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":1024},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society","url":"http://www.ieeeaps.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5382589","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Phased arrays","Antenna arrays","Phase modulation","Antenna measurements","Lighting","Directive antennas","Frequency","Switches","Resource description framework","Receiving antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","array signal processing","directive antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["two-element time-modulated direction finding array","direction finding antenna","time switched array element","phase modulated output","angle of arrival","modulation depth","frequency 2400 MHz"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Antenna","array","direction finding"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TAP.2009.2039301","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel5/8/5423254/05382589.pdf","startPage":"986","endPage":"988","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.2009.2039301","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5423254","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Experimental Two-Element Time-Modulated Direction Finding Array","abstract":"A two-element time-modulated array system is configured to operate as a direction finding antenna.

The objective of the optimal design using the combined design of simulation trial and finite-element analysis (FEA) approach is to ensure that the motor-driven steer's performance for compact cars is insensitive to noise, with moderate computational effort. The optimal design process takes into consideration noises that arise in the unexpected load condition, such as tolerances for parameter variation of the electric motor and reduction gear in the actuator. The optimization is realized by a simulation and analysis tool that integrates the Target-wise Parameter Optimization and the FEA. The proposed procedure can not only reduce the size of an actuator but also raise the system efficiency of the motor-driven steering (MDS). In this paper, we have used an orthogonal array L18(2\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1</sup>\n x 3\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">7</sup>\n) to implement simulation trials and made a response table and graph of control factors. Eventually, the optimal values of the control factors, the diameter of the stator core, the width of the wire, the turn number of the wire, the gear ratio of the worm and worm-wheel gear, the surface flux density of the magnet, the armature core's stack factor, and the module ratio of the worm and worm-wheel gear were decided, and then, the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) was increased to 20.58%. The simulation results demonstrated that the proposed method applied to the optimal design of the MDS' actuator was feasible and efficient. In this paper, the design optimization process is described, and the results are presented.","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2009.2038397","pdfPath":"/iel5/41/5410131/05382594.pdf","startPage":"900","endPage":"908","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2009.2038397","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5410131","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Multiobjective Parametric Optimization for Passenger-Car Steering Actuator","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5382594/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 January 2010","displayDocTitle":"A Multiobjective Parametric Optimization for Passenger-Car Steering Actuator","volume":"57","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"08 February 2010","accessionNumber":"11137569","publicationDate":"March 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5382594/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Multiobjective Parametric Optimization for Passenger-Car Steering Actuator","sourcePdf":"tie-choi-2038397.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.072667S","chronDate":"March  2010","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"5410131","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"5410131","articleId":"5382594","onlineDate":"15 January 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5382598,"authors":[{"name":"J.

The key components are developed as an integrated system, linking the science, technology, and final application of a 1000-MWe pure-fusion power plant. The science and technologies developed here are flexible enough to be applied to other size systems. The scientific justification for this work is a family of target designs (simulations) that show that direct drive has the potential to provide the high gains needed for a pure-fusion power plant. Two competing lasers are under development: the diode-pumped solid-state laser (DPPSL) and the electron-beam-pumped krypton fluoride (KrF) gas laser. This paper will present the current state of the art in the target designs and lasers, as well as the other IFE technologies required for energy, including final optics (grazing incidence and dielectrics), chambers, and target fabrication, injection, and tracking technologies. All of these are applicable to both laser systems and to other laser IFE-based concepts. However, in some of the higher performance target designs, the DPPSL will require more energy to reach the same yield as with the KrF laser.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Plasma Science","pdfPath":"/iel5/27/5444586/05382598.pdf","startPage":"690","endPage":"703","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Plasma Science","doi":"10.1109/TPS.2009.2037629","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPS.2009.2037629","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5444586","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5382598","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The Science and Technologies for Fusion Energy With Lasers and Direct-Drive Targets","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Laser fusion","Laser theory","Gas lasers","Solid lasers","Power generation","Optical design","Joining processes","Diodes","Dielectrics","Optical device fabrication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["gas lasers","laser fusion","nuclear power stations","optical pumping","plasma applications","solid lasers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fusion energy","direct-drive targets","multidisciplinary multiinstitutional program","inertial fusion energy","laser drivers","pure-fusion power plant","diode-pumped solid-state laser","electron-beam-pumped krypton fluoride gas laser","target fabrication","injection","power 1000 MW"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Fusion power generation","fusion reactors","laser amplifiers","laser fusion","magnetic fields","nanotechnology","optical tracking"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5382598/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 January 2010","displayDocTitle":"The Science and Technologies for Fusion Energy With Lasers and Direct-Drive Targets","volume":"38","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/5382598/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2010","accessionNumber":"11228263","dateOfInsertion":"08 April 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Science and Technologies for Fusion Energy With Lasers and Direct-Drive Targets","sourcePdf":"tps-sethian-2037629.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.375301S","chronDate":"April  2010","xplore-pub-id":"27","isNumber":"5444586","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"27","citationCount":"40","xplore-issue":"5444586","articleId":"5382598","onlineDate":"15 January 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5382658,"authors":[{"name":"Jun Cai","affiliation":["Aero-Power Sci-Tech Center, College of Automation, Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, China"],"firstName":"Jun","lastName":"Cai","id":"37404372100"},{"name":"Zhiquan Deng","affiliation":["Aero-Power Sci-Tech Center, College of Automation, Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, China"],"firstName":"Zhiquan","lastName":"Deng","id":"37397320400"},{"name":"Zeyuan Liu","affiliation":["Aero-Power Sci-Tech Center, College of Automation, Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, China"],"firstName":"Zeyuan","lastName":"Liu","id":"37400640800"},{"name":"Wenyu Zeng","affiliation":["Aero-Power Sci-Tech Center, College of Automation, Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, China"],"firstName":"Wenyu","lastName":"Zeng","id":"38100656900"},{"name":"Honghao Guo","affiliation":["Aero-Power Sci-Tech Center, College of Automation, Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, China"],"firstName":"Honghao","lastName":"Guo","id":"37673258300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5177-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-4-88686-067-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5382658","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":352},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5382658","abstract":"Based on the artificial neural networks(ANN), a new rotor position estimation method for switched reluctance motor(SRM) drives is investigated in this paper.

After sufficient training, the correlation among flux linkage, phase current and rotor position can be built up with the ANN. In this way, the rotor position of SRM can be estimated with the ANN from the calculated flux linkage and phase current. In order to verify the validity of this method, a 7.5 kw 12/8 structure high-speed SRM is designed as the study object and the corresponding simulation model is developed via Matlab.

In order to verify the design concept, a trial motor was constructed and a large range experiments were conducted to measure motor characteristics.","publicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Electrical Machines and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Electrical Machines and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5367265/5382637/05382706.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doi":"10.1109/ICEMS.2009.5382706","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICEMS.2009.5382706","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5382637","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Development of an axial gap motor with amorphous metal cores","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5382706/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-18 Nov. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Development of an axial gap motor with amorphous metal cores","htmlLink":"/document/5382706/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"15 January 2010","accessionNumber":"11084591","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"15-18 Nov. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Development of an axial gap motor with amorphous metal cores","confLoc":"Tokyo, Japan","sourcePdf":"LS01B004.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04632S","chronDate":"15-18 Nov. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5367265","isNumber":"5382637","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5367265","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5382637","articleId":"5382706","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5382713,"authors":[{"name":"Vanxay Phimmasone","affiliation":["Department of Engineering & Applied Sciences, Sophia University, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Vanxay","lastName":"Phimmasone","id":"37592267900"},{"name":"Tsugio Endo","affiliation":["Department of Engineering & Applied Sciences, Sophia University, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Tsugio","lastName":"Endo","id":"38105191200"},{"name":"Yuta Kondo","affiliation":["Department of Engineering & Applied Sciences, Sophia University, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Yuta","lastName":"Kondo","id":"37595392800"},{"name":"Masafumi Miyatake","affiliation":["Department of Engineering & Applied Sciences, Sophia University, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Masafumi","lastName":"Miyatake","id":"37270892000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5177-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-4-88686-067-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5382713","dbTime":"14 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":27,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":833},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Particle tracking","Photovoltaic systems","Solar power generation","Power generation","Particle swarm optimization","Voltage","Photovoltaic cells","Diodes","Equations","Costs"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["maximum power point trackers","particle swarm optimisation","photovoltaic power systems","solar cell arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["maximum power point tracker","photovoltaic generators","particle swarm optimization","repulsive force","maximum power point tracking control","photovoltaic generation systems","operating terminal voltage","photovoltaic array","partial shading condition","repulsion term","insolation change","PSO-MPPT algorithm","electrical energy","multidimensional optimization"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Maximum Power Point Tracker","Multidimensional optimization","Photovoltaic array","Particle Swarm Optimization"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5382713","abstract":"This paper deals with Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) control of photovoltaic generators. Photovoltaic (PV) generation systems need maximum power point tracker because the PV power output depends on the operating terminal voltage and current. Further, the PV array exhibits two or more MPP's under partial shading condition and hence finding the MPP using conventional techniques is a difficult task. To overcome the difficulty, finding the MPP, the authors improve the MPPT with Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) technique by adding a kind of \u00bfrepulsion term\u00bf to the equation of PSO algorithm. The term enables to improve the response to various types of insolation change. This results in lower cost, higher overall efficiency and also the algorithm is simple. The improved PSO-MPPT algorithm is verified through simulative and experimental studies. It is proved this algorithm is superior to the original PSO-MPPT methods by evaluating generated power and electrical energy.","doi":"10.1109/ICEMS.2009.5382713","publicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Electrical Machines and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Electrical Machines and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5367265/5382637/05382713.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5382637","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICEMS.2009.5382713","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improvement of the Maximum Power Point Tracker for photovoltaic generators with Particle Swarm Optimization technique by adding repulsive force among agents","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5382713/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-18 Nov. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Improvement of the Maximum Power Point Tracker for photovoltaic generators with Particle Swarm Optimization technique by adding repulsive force among agents","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5382713/","dateOfInsertion":"15 January 2010","publicationDate":"Nov. 2009","accessionNumber":"11084598","conferenceDate":"15-18 Nov. 2009","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improvement of the Maximum Power Point Tracker for photovoltaic generators with Particle Swarm Optimization technique by adding repulsive force among agents","confLoc":"Tokyo, Japan","sourcePdf":"LS01D004.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05541S","chronDate":"15-18 Nov. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5367265","isNumber":"5382637","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5367265","citationCount":"27","xplore-issue":"5382637","articleId":"5382713","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5382719,"authors":[{"name":"Tsuyoshi Hanamoto","affiliation":["Graduate School of Life Science & Systems Engineering, Kyushu Institute of Technology, Fukuoka, Japan"],"firstName":"Tsuyoshi","lastName":"Hanamoto","id":"37297610700"},{"name":"Satoshi Takanabe","affiliation":["Graduate School of Life Science & Systems Engineering, Kyushu Institute of Technology, Fukuoka, Japan"],"firstName":"Satoshi","lastName":"Takanabe","id":"38108757900"},{"name":"Hidehiro Ikeda","affiliation":["Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Nishinippon Institute of Technology, Fukuoka, Japan"],"firstName":"Hidehiro","lastName":"Ikeda","id":"37539286400"},{"name":"Teruo.

It is clarified that the loss reduction effect varies with the harmonic orders and that the effect depends on the types of the rotors, for example, interior and surface magnet types.","doi":"10.1109/ICEMS.2009.5382795","publicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Electrical Machines and Systems","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICEMS.2009.5382795","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5382637","pdfPath":"/iel5/5367265/5382637/05382795.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Electrical Machines and Systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Magnetic losses","Synchronous motors","Magnetic flux","Magnetic separation","Pulse width modulation inverters","Eddy currents","Finite element methods","Rotors","Permanent magnet motors","Magnetic analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["finite element analysis","Fourier transforms","synchronous motors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["eddy-current loss reduction","magnet segmentation","synchronous motors","concentrated windings","3D finite element analysis","Fourier transformation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Eddy currents","finite element methods","harmonics","inverters","losses","magnetic field","permanent magnet machines"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Effect of eddy-current loss reduction by magnet segmentation in synchronous motors with concentrated windings","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5382795/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5382795/","accessionNumber":"11084389","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"15 January 2010","publicationDate":"Nov. 2009","conferenceDate":"15-18 Nov. 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"15-18 Nov. 2009","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Effect of eddy-current loss reduction by magnet segmentation in synchronous motors with concentrated windings","confLoc":"Tokyo, Japan","sourcePdf":"LS05A005.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072515S","chronDate":"15-18 Nov. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5367265","isNumber":"5382637","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5367265","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5382637","articleId":"5382795","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5382811,"authors":[{"name":"S.

The high efficiency performance for IPMSM is analyzed based on energy losses balance analysis between iron losses, copper loss and mechanical loss. In addition, the important machine characteristics are also analyzed. The finite element analysis (FEA) is used to precisely calculate machine parameters, and then the equivalent circuit method (ECM) is performed for predicting motor performances. The calculated results are confirmed by testing the two type Ferrite/NdFeB IPM synchronous motors.

This approach is based on the chaotic Baker map. It is known that OFDM transmitted signals are in complex format, having in-phase and in-quadrature components. If a chaotic randomization process is performed on each component, separately, prior to transmission, the likelihood that both the real and imaginary components of the transmitted signal at a certain time are of large amplitude gets lower. As a result, a reduction of the PAPR can be achieved.

The new algorithm adopts a new strategy that successfully increases OFDM symbol rate. Instead of using a fixed training pilot sequence, the proposed algorithm uses a logic controller to choose among several available training patterns. The controller choice is based on the cross-correlation between pilot symbols over two consecutive time instants (which is considered to be a suitable measure of channel stationarity) as well as the deviation from the desired BER. Simulation results of the system performance confirm the effectiveness of this new channel estimation technique over traditional non-adaptive estimation methods in increasing the data rate of OFDM symbols while maintaining the same probability of error.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Computer Engineering & Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5373586/5383051/05383066.pdf","startPage":"573","endPage":"578","publicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Computer Engineering & Systems","doi":"10.1109/ICCES.2009.5383066","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCES.2009.5383066","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5383051","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5383066","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A new adaptive channel estimation for frequency selective time varying fading OFDM channels","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Channel estimation","Frequency estimation","Fading","OFDM","Heuristic algorithms","Partial transmit sequences","Logic","Time measurement","Bit error rate","System performance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","error statistics","fading channels","OFDM modulation","time-varying channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive channel estimation","frequency selective time varying fading OFDM channels","OFDM symbol rate","training pilot sequence","logic controller","cross-correlation","BER"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Channel estimation","Cross-correlation","logic controller","OFDM","pilot symbols patterns"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5383066/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-16 Dec. 2009","displayDocTitle":"A new adaptive channel estimation for frequency selective time varying fading OFDM channels","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5383066/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","accessionNumber":"11072485","dateOfInsertion":"15 January 2010","conferenceDate":"14-16 Dec. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new adaptive channel estimation for frequency selective time varying fading OFDM channels","confLoc":"Cairo, Egypt","sourcePdf":"17Paper066.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051204S","chronDate":"14-16 Dec. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5373586","isNumber":"5383051","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5373586","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5383051","articleId":"5383066","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5383071,"authors":[{"name":"Faisal S.

Approximation coefficients are then used to compute MFCCs. Experimental results were computed on PIEAS Speech Database for text independent speaker identification. The proposed method gives very good recognition rate i.e. 96.25% for non telephonic and 86.77% for telephonic speech data.

UPC is an extension of ANSI C-primarily designed for programming distributed memory parallel hardware. The FDTD method is a powerful and widely used numerical technique in computational electromagnetics community. It is a resource - CPU cycles and memory-hungry technique. Consequently, a parallel implementation is highly desirable to decrease time-to-solution and be able to study larger problems with limited resources. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to exploit UPC to parallelize the FDTD method. We evaluate the performance of our implementation on a cluster of four SunFire v890 compute nodes - each equipped with 16 processing cores - and report impressive speedups.","doi":"10.1109/INMIC.2009.5383096","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE 13th International Multitopic Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE 13th International Multitopic Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5373587/5383072/05383096.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INMIC.2009.5383096","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5383072","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Using unified parallel C to parallelize the FDTD method of computational electrodynamics","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5383096","pubTopics":[{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Using unified parallel C to parallelize the FDTD method of computational electrodynamics","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-15 Dec. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5383096/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"14-15 Dec. 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","accessionNumber":"11072582","dateOfInsertion":"15 January 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5383096/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Using unified parallel C to parallelize the FDTD method of computational electrodynamics","confLoc":"Islamabad, Pakistan","sourcePdf":"PAPER72.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042724S","chronDate":"14-15 Dec. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5373587","isNumber":"5383072","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5373587","xplore-issue":"5383072","articleId":"5383096","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5383098,"authors":[{"name":"Mian Abdul Razzaq","affiliation":["Electronic, Electrical, Control and Instrumentation Engineering Department, Hanyang University, South Korea"],"firstName":"Mian Abdul","lastName":"Razzaq","id":"38180275500"},{"name":"Joong-Geun Rhee","affiliation":["Faculty of Electronics & Communication Engineering, Hanyang University, South Korea"],"firstName":"Joong-Geun","lastName":"Rhee","id":"37437795800"},{"name":"Sung-Il Yang","affiliation":["Faculty of Electronics & Communication Engineering, Hanyang University, South Korea"],"firstName":"Sung-Il","lastName":"Yang","id":"37366758400"},{"name":"Muhammad Shoaib Khalid","affiliation":["Electronic, Electrical, Control and Instrumentation Engineering Department, Hanyang University, South Korea"],"firstName":"Muhammad Shoaib","lastName":"Khalid","id":"38110447500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4872-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4873-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5383098","dbTime":"19 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":541},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Microstrip antennas","Bandwidth","Mutual coupling","Slot antennas","Channel capacity","Costs","Receiving antennas","Transmitters","Size control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna radiation patterns","microstrip antenna arrays","MIMO communication","planar inverted-F antennas","slot antenna arrays","telecommunication services"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["T-shaped Slot PIFA","communication services","multiple-input multiple-output technology","microstrip antennas","planar inverted-F antenna","VSWR","MIMO antennas","PCB devices","omnidirectional radiation pattern","frequency 2.45 GHz"]}],"abstract":"Because of rapidly increasing demand for high capacity communication services compact antennas have become center of research interest nowadays and this reduction of size becomes much more important especially when we want to use the multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) technology; to increase channel capacity, in modern compact devices. Microstrip antennas are an attractive option due to low cost, and small size. However to fulfill need for more compact and miniaturized devices; a dual feed dual element planar inverted-F antenna (PIFA) at 2.45GHz has been proposed on a very small PCB (60 mm \u00d7 20 mm \u00d7 0.8 mm), to be used for ISM 2.45 GHz band. While total volume occupied by two antennas is 10 mm \u00d7 20 mm \u00d7 2.5 mm. -10 dB return loss or VSWR=2 criterion for required bandwidth has been satisfied, only with help of designing a novel radiation structure. To miniaturize size of PIFA a novel T-shaped slot has been employed in radiation structure. Overall size is compact than small MIMO antennas, available in open literature. As the proposed design is suitable for different feeding environments, it can be used in different small size PCB devices, for different applications. Results show satisfactory bandwidth, and omnidirectional radiation pattern.","doi":"10.1109/INMIC.2009.5383098","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE 13th International Multitopic Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE 13th International Multitopic Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5373587/5383072/05383098.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INMIC.2009.5383098","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5383072","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A novel T-shaped slot PIFA for MIMO applications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5383098","pubTopics":[{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-15 Dec. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5383098/","displayDocTitle":"A novel T-shaped slot PIFA for MIMO applications","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","accessionNumber":"11072584","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5383098/","conferenceDate":"14-15 Dec. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"15 January 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A novel T-shaped slot PIFA for MIMO applications","confLoc":"Islamabad, Pakistan","sourcePdf":"PAPER70.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054914S","chronDate":"14-15 Dec. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5373587","isNumber":"5383072","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5373587","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5383072","articleId":"5383098","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5383111,"authors":[{"name":"Sobia Tariq Javed","affiliation":["Center for Research in Urdu Language Processing, National University of Computer and Emerging Sciences, Pakistan"],"firstName":"Sobia Tariq","lastName":"Javed","id":"37086001780"},{"name":"Sarmad Hussain","affiliation":["Center for Research in Urdu Language Processing, National University of Computer and Emerging Sciences, Pakistan"],"firstName":"Sarmad","lastName":"Hussain","id":"37290340500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4872-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4873-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5383111","dbTime":"1 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":20,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":226},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5383111","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optical character recognition software","Writing","Text recognition","Data mining","Information retrieval","Image segmentation","Image recognition","Optical distortion","Optical sensors","Character recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["natural language processing","optical character recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Nastalique specific pre-recognition process","Urdu OCR","Urdu language","Arabic script","Nastalique writing style","Nastalique script","Nastalique specific pre-processing method","text recognition process","optical character recognition"]}],"doi":"10.1109/INMIC.2009.5383111","pdfPath":"/iel5/5373587/5383072/05383111.pdf","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE 13th International Multitopic Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE 13th International Multitopic Conference","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5383072","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INMIC.2009.5383111","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improving Nastalique specific pre-recognition process for Urdu OCR","abstract":"Urdu language is written using Arabic script in Nastalique writing style. Nastalique script is highly cursive, context sensitive and is hard to process as only the last character in its ligature sits on the baseline. In addition, it exhibits character and ligature level spatial overlap. Due to these factors, the placement of dots and other diacritics is also highly contextual and variable. There is now increasing amount of work to process and recognize Nastalique script to develop Urdu OCR. This paper proposes improvements to these methods. The paper focuses on Nastalique specific pre-processing methods which can be employed before the text recognition process.

In order to implement correct security policy, the anomalies in firewall rules should be analyzed carefully, especially in enterprise network. In this paper, we present a new formal framework for analysis and resolution of anomalies in firewall rules. First of all, a formal model based on propositional logic is presented to specify rules. Then we specify all anomalies that identified in the latest researches based on our model. Current studies for analysis of anomalies are based on one to one rule anomalies, but we identify total version of anomalies based on one to many relationship of rules. Furthermore we have designed and implemented a tool based on theorem proving for verification of the specified anomalies. In addition, we present two algorithms for resolving anomalies in a rule database based on our formal model. These algorithms minimize the number of rules without changing the policy. Experimental results indicate that our algorithms for discovery single and total anomalies run in 2-3 seconds for a very large firewall with thousands of rules.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analyzing and resolving anomalies in firewall security policies based on propositional logic","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE 13th International Multitopic Conference","doi":"10.1109/INMIC.2009.5383125","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE 13th International Multitopic Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5373587/5383072/05383125.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INMIC.2009.5383125","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5383072","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5383125","pubTopics":[{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5383125/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-15 Dec. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Analyzing and resolving anomalies in firewall security policies based on propositional logic","conferenceDate":"14-15 Dec. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5383125/","dateOfInsertion":"15 January 2010","publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","accessionNumber":"11072612","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analyzing and resolving anomalies in firewall security policies based on propositional logic","confLoc":"Islamabad, Pakistan","sourcePdf":"PAPER40.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06043S","chronDate":"14-15 Dec. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5373587","isNumber":"5383072","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5373587","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"5383072","articleId":"5383125","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5383129,"authors":[{"name":"Mansoor Ahmed","affiliation":["Al-Beruni Center for Research Wireless Communication, Mohammad Ali Jinnah University, Islamabad, Pakistan"],"firstName":"Mansoor","lastName":"Ahmed","id":"38584888200"},{"name":"Noor M.

The effects of non isotropic scattering can be captured by using Von Mises distribution for the angle of arrival (AOA) of the scattered waves at the receiver. In order to benefit from the spatial diversity of ST coding, we need to have perfect channel information at the receiver. Kalman Filter (KF) with higher order autoregressive (AR) model is used for tracking and estimation of the non isotropic Rayleigh channel.

In this paper, we propose a smart antenna receiver architecture based on CDMA technology comprising both Rake Receiver (for multipath mitigation) and beamforming on the basis of DOA estimation by ESPRIT algorithm. The purpose is to combine time-space diversity and spatial diversity to achieve better signal reception. The simulation results for the proposed system are presented.

As a solution, dynamic spectrum access (DSA) is being addressed to allocate already assigned but sparsely used frequency bands to secondary users without causing any significant interference to primary users. It exploits opportunities in temporal dimension rather than in spectral dimension. Cyclic data transmission is preferred in wireless factory automation systems. We propose the exploitation of this cyclic transmission to implement a DSA based cognitive radio (CR). The CR, working as a secondary user, will operate in the presence of primary users and avoids any harmful interference among coexisting systems. We implemented this idea using both software defined radio (SDR), and conventional hardware defined radio (HDR) based architectures. The experimental results show satisfactory robustness against cyclic interferers.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"14-15 Dec. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5383134/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"11072621","publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","conferenceDate":"14-15 Dec. 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5383134/","dateOfInsertion":"15 January 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Dynamic spectrum access: Cyclic transmission exploitation using cognitive radio for coexistence optimized wireless automation systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamic spectrum access: Cyclic transmission exploitation using cognitive radio for coexistence optimized wireless automation systems","confLoc":"Islamabad, Pakistan","sourcePdf":"PAPER33.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043039S","chronDate":"14-15 Dec. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5373587","isNumber":"5383072","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5373587","xplore-issue":"5383072","articleId":"5383134","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5383138,"authors":[{"name":"Ejaz A.

The closed form expressions are very useful for evaluating system's performance without carrying out time consuming simulations. In this paper, we thus, derive exact closed form expression for average SER of MIMO-OFDM systems employing gray coded M-PSK modulation using the traditional probability density function (PDF) approach over uncorrelated Nakagami-m fading channels using OSTBCs. We further deduce the closed form expressions of average SER for gray coded binary phase-shift keying (B-PSK), quadrature phase-shift keying (Q-PSK) and eight phase-shift keying (8-PSK) modulation schemes by computing the value of the parameter, g for M = 2, 4 and 8, respectively. These expressions are valid for both frequency-flat and frequency-selective Nakagami-m fading MIMO channels and can be evaluated without any numerical integration techniques. We also show that average BER and SER in case of frequency-selective Rayleigh fading channels remain independent to the number of taps, L of the multipath fading channel used in the system. Moreover, by utilizing the encoding and decoding algorithms for various OSTBCs, Monte Carlo simulation of MIMO-OFDM systems using multiple transmit and receive antennas for different gray coded phase-shift keying modulations is presented. Theoretical results and the simulation results are drawn on the same figures in order to show the validity of our analytical results.","doi":"10.1109/INMIC.2009.5383138","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE 13th International Multitopic Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE 13th International Multitopic Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5373587/5383072/05383138.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INMIC.2009.5383138","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5383072","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Exact SER analysis of OSTBC MIMO-OFDM systems over uncorrelated Nakagami-m fading channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5383138","pubTopics":[{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-15 Dec. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5383138/","displayDocTitle":"Exact SER analysis of OSTBC MIMO-OFDM systems over uncorrelated Nakagami-m fading channels","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","accessionNumber":"11072625","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5383138/","conferenceDate":"14-15 Dec. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"15 January 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Exact SER analysis of OSTBC MIMO-OFDM systems over uncorrelated Nakagami-m fading channels","confLoc":"Islamabad, Pakistan","sourcePdf":"PAPER29.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06989S","chronDate":"14-15 Dec. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5373587","isNumber":"5383072","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5373587","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"5383072","articleId":"5383138","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5383159,"authors":[{"name":"Kashif Waqas","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, National University of Computer and Emerging Sciences, Islamabad, Pakistan"],"firstName":"Kashif","lastName":"Waqas","id":"38109524800"},{"name":"Rauf Baig","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, National University of Computer and Emerging Sciences, Islamabad, Pakistan"],"firstName":"Rauf","lastName":"Baig","id":"37369091000"},{"name":"Shahid Ali","affiliation":["National University of Science and Technology, Pakistan"],"firstName":"Shahid","lastName":"Ali","id":"38556222600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4872-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4873-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5383159","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":13,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":799},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5383159","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Genetic algorithms","Computer science","Large-scale systems","Data mining","Filters","Costs","Manufacturing industries","Productivity","Evolutionary computation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data mining","genetic algorithms","set theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feature subset selection","multi-objective genetic algorithm","optimization"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Genetic Algorithms","Multi-Objective Genetic Algorithms","Feature Subset","Datasets","Data Mining"]}],"doi":"10.1109/INMIC.2009.5383159","pdfPath":"/iel5/5373587/5383072/05383159.pdf","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE 13th International Multitopic Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE 13th International Multitopic Conference","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5383072","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INMIC.2009.5383159","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Feature subset selection using multi-objective genetic algorithms","abstract":"Feature subset selection is a very vast field and it plays a vital role in the modern age because of extremely large datasets with huge number of irrelevant features. In past people have been using several approaches to find subset of features that is most relevant and appropriate. As we explore different techniques we come to know that Genetic Algorithms prove to be exceptionally good in large searches. Even simple genetic algorithms for feature subset selection have produced good results. Recent researcher's show that research is now more focused on Multi-Objective Genetic Algorithms for searching techniques rather than simple genetic algorithms because most of real world examples are multi-objective. Same is the case with feature subset selection, most of the time one subset of features is not of huge interest rather several subsets of features is of interest. So applying multi-objective genetic algorithms rather than simple genetic algorithms produces some great results. This approach is novel and has not been explored to a very large scale. Our research showed that independent sub-sets of features are excellent in accuracy. We have performed this approach on several known datasets present at UCI website for the sake of benchmarking. By observing the results we could conclude that scope of our research does not end here.

Concentration in the paper is on the transmission of encrypted images for the purpose of high definition television (HDTV) broadcasting. This comparison study is held to determine the best one suitable for HDTV broadcasting of encrypted images. The encryption approach adopted in this paper is based on chaotic Baker maps because the encoding and decoding steps in this approach are simple and fast enough for HDTV applications. This approach belongs to the family of fast permutation algorithms. And AES is also discussed where it's algorithm has very good performance in both hardware and software implementations. It also has very low memory requirements, and the algorithm's internal round structure benefits from instruction level parallelism. This ability will improve its performance. The different types of channels and the different parameters of OFDM modulation are considered in the comparison. The experimental results reveal the superiority of the FFT-OFDM over the DCT-OFDM for the transmission of encrypted images.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient transmission of chaotic and AES encrypted images with OFDM over an AWGN channel","publicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Computer Engineering & Systems","doi":"10.1109/ICCES.2009.5383240","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Computer Engineering & Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5373586/5383051/05383240.pdf","startPage":"353","endPage":"358","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCES.2009.5383240","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5383051","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5383240","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5383240/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-16 Dec. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Efficient transmission of chaotic and AES encrypted images with OFDM over an AWGN channel","conferenceDate":"14-16 Dec. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5383240/","dateOfInsertion":"15 January 2010","publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","accessionNumber":"11072463","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient transmission of chaotic and AES encrypted images with OFDM over an AWGN channel","confLoc":"Cairo, Egypt","sourcePdf":"11Paper048.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.075141S","chronDate":"14-16 Dec. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5373586","isNumber":"5383051","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5373586","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5383051","articleId":"5383240","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-16"},{"_id":5383247,"authors":[{"name":"Naglaa F.

In the proposed technique, both the in-phase and in-quadrature components of the OFDM signals after the inverse fast Fourier transform (IFFT) are transformed using either the discrete sine transform (DST) or the discrete cosine transform (DCT). It is known that both the DCT and the DST have an energy compaction property concentrating most of the signal energy in the first few samples after the application of the transform and leaving the rest of samples close to zero. This property can be exploited for PAPR reduction by interchanging the first half of samples of the in-phase component by the last half of samples of the in-quadrature component after applying the discrete transform on both of them, separately. The OFDM signal is transmitted in this format. By this process of replacement, it can be guaranteed that if either the in-phase or the in-quadrature component of the OFDM signal is large, the other will be small.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Computer Engineering & Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5373586/5383051/05383247.pdf","startPage":"333","endPage":"337","publicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Computer Engineering & Systems","doi":"10.1109/ICCES.2009.5383247","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCES.2009.5383247","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5383051","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5383247","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Peak power reduction of OFDM signals using trigonometric transforms","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Peak to average power ratio","Discrete transforms","Discrete cosine transforms","Power engineering and energy","Fast Fourier transforms","Signal processing","OFDM modulation","Partial transmit sequences","Intersymbol interference","Digital video broadcasting"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["discrete cosine transforms","fast Fourier transforms","OFDM modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["peak power reduction","OFDM signals","trigonometric transforms","peak to average power ratio","PAPR","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","inverse fast Fourier transform","IFFT","discrete sine transform","DST","discrete cosine transform","DCT","energy compaction property"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["OFDM","Trigonometric Transforms","PAPR"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5383247/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-16 Dec. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Peak power reduction of OFDM signals using trigonometric transforms","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5383247/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","accessionNumber":"11072537","dateOfInsertion":"15 January 2010","conferenceDate":"14-16 Dec. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Peak power reduction of OFDM signals using trigonometric transforms","confLoc":"Cairo, Egypt","sourcePdf":"10Paper053.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.110993S","chronDate":"14-16 Dec. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5373586","isNumber":"5383051","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5373586","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5383051","articleId":"5383247","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5383290,"authors":[{"name":"M.

LVQ classification algorithms do not approximate density functions of class samples but directly define class boundaries based on prototypes, a nearest-neighbor rule and a winner-takes-it-all paradigm. It has a superior performance over back-propagation (BP) method in the sense of minimizing the classification errors while maintaining rapid convergence. First, the principal component analysis is used to reduce dimensionality of the input features and increase the distinguishing capability. Then, six LVQ neural networks are trained to classify each case into \u00bfhealthy\u00bf and \u00bfarrhythmia\u00bf classes. The networks are trained and tested for the UCI ECG arrhythmia dataset. This dataset is a good environment to test classifiers as it is incomplete and ambiguous bio-signal data from multiple patients. The classification performance of each algorithm is evaluated using four measures; sensitivity, specificity, classification accuracy and time taken to build the system. Experimental results recommend using LVQ algorithm for a more extended research regarding this topic.","doi":"10.1109/ICCES.2009.5383295","pdfPath":"/iel5/5373586/5383051/05383295.pdf","startPage":"139","endPage":"144","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Computer Engineering & Systems","publicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Computer Engineering & Systems","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCES.2009.5383295","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5383051","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Classification of ECG arrhythmia using learning vector quantization neural networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5383295/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-16 Dec. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Classification of ECG arrhythmia using learning vector quantization neural networks","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"15 January 2010","accessionNumber":"11084327","publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5383295/","conferenceDate":"14-16 Dec. 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Classification of ECG arrhythmia using learning vector quantization neural networks","confLoc":"Cairo, Egypt","sourcePdf":"05Paper087.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065697S","chronDate":"14-16 Dec. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5373586","isNumber":"5383051","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5373586","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"5383051","articleId":"5383295","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5383313,"authors":[{"name":"E.

This paper introduces a comparative study between the infrared face recognition systems using the principle component analysis (PCA) and the Zernike moments (ZM) techniques. The performance is evaluated according to the recognition rate, time consumption, and immunity to both Salt & Pepper and Gaussian noise. The analysis shows that the PCA technique has the same performance as the ZM technique if a large size dataset is used. On the other hand, the ZM technique outperforms the PCA technique when using a small size dataset, but it consumes a time approximately equal to four times that required by the PCA technique. The simulations also show that the ZM technique outperforms the PCA technique in the presence of both Salt & Pepper and Gaussian Noise types at various values of noise variance.","doi":"10.1109/ICCES.2009.5383313","publicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Computer Engineering & Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Computer Engineering & Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5373586/5383051/05383313.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCES.2009.5383313","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5383051","startPage":"45","endPage":"50","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance analysis of infrared face recognition using PCA and ZM","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5383313","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Performance analysis of infrared face recognition using PCA and ZM","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-16 Dec. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5383313/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"14-16 Dec. 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","accessionNumber":"11084330","dateOfInsertion":"15 January 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5383313/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance analysis of infrared face recognition using PCA and ZM","confLoc":"Cairo, Egypt","sourcePdf":"02Paper043.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071614S","chronDate":"14-16 Dec. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5373586","isNumber":"5383051","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5373586","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5383051","articleId":"5383313","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":5383314,"authors":[{"name":"M.

The main advantage of the proposed technique is to reduce number of search area loading cycles by taking advantage of the vertical and horizontal overlap between adjacent search areas and thus improve the overall performance of the motion search and frame encoding. The proposed technique was implemented in FPGA as part of the flexible triangle search (FTS) motion estimation algorithm. However, the proposed technique can be used in similar search algorithm. The FTS is a fast block-matching algorithm for motion estimation proposed in previous work. The FTS can be used for block-based motion estimation where it can locate the best matching blocks between two frames using a search triangle that changes its direction and its size through a set of operations. These operations provide the triangle with the large flexibility to locate the best matching block in less number of search iterations. Simulation results indicates that the proposed technique reduces number of cycles required for motion estimation by around 8% and thus enable the video encoder to support higher frequencies or larger resolutions. The proposed design was implemented, simulated, and tested using VHDL and synthesized using Xilinx ISE for the Xilinx Spartan3 device. The results obtained were compared to an FPGA implementation of the FTS algorithm published in previous work.","doi":"10.1109/ICCES.2009.5383314","publicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Computer Engineering & Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Computer Engineering & Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5373586/5383051/05383314.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCES.2009.5383314","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5383051","startPage":"33","endPage":"36","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient search area loading technique for block-based motion estimation and its FPGA implementation using flexible triangle search algorithm","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5383314","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Efficient search area loading technique for block-based motion estimation and its FPGA implementation using flexible triangle search algorithm","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-16 Dec. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5383314/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"14-16 Dec. 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","accessionNumber":"11072489","dateOfInsertion":"15 January 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5383314/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient search area loading technique for block-based motion estimation and its FPGA implementation using flexible triangle search algorithm","confLoc":"Cairo, Egypt","sourcePdf":"01Paper198.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065048S","chronDate":"14-16 Dec. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5373586","isNumber":"5383051","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5373586","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5383051","articleId":"5383314","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5383318,"authors":[{"name":"Mohamed El-Hadedy","affiliation":["Q2S, NTNU, Trondheim, Norway"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5373586/5383051/5383318/5383318-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Mohamed EI-Hadedy is PhD student at the Centre for Quantifiable Quality of Service in Communication Systems (Q2S) at Norwegian University of Science and Technology-Trondheim, Norway.

They are used in countless applications such as message authentication codes (MAC), Digital Signatures (DS) and mobile trusted modules (MTM). Serious attacks have been reported against cryptographic hash algorithms, including SHA-1. Because the SHA-1 and SHA-2 families share a similar design, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in 2007 decided to start a world-wide development process for choosing the next secure hash standard SHA-3. A pivotal part of the process is an open competition for bringing forward new and secure cryptographic hash functions. The Blue Midnight Wish hash function is one of the second round candidates for the SHA-3 competition. In this paper, we describe low area FPGA and ASIC implementations for the Blue Midnight Wish compression function with digest size of 256 bits (BMW-256). Using Xilinx FPGA platform Virtex 5 \"XC5VLX30\", we implemented BMW-256 using 1986 slices (including the internal memory), and using only 122 slices for an implementation that uses external memory. By using 0.8 \u03bcm CMOS standard cell library the ASIC implementation of BMW-256 takes approximately 13.5 Kgates (including the internal memory), and only 4 Kgates for an implementation that uses external memory.","publicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Computer Engineering & Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Computer Engineering & Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5373586/5383051/05383318.pdf","startPage":"10","endPage":"14","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Low area FPGA and ASIC implementations of the hash function \u201cBlue Midnight Wish-256\u201d","doi":"10.1109/ICCES.2009.5383318","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5383051","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCES.2009.5383318","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5383318","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5383318/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-16 Dec. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Low area FPGA and ASIC implementations of the hash function \u201cBlue Midnight Wish-256\u201d","dateOfInsertion":"15 January 2010","publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","accessionNumber":"11072474","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"14-16 Dec. 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5383318/","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low area FPGA and ASIC implementations of the hash function \u201cBlue Midnight Wish-256\u201d","confLoc":"Cairo, Egypt","sourcePdf":"01Paper067.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.0747S","chronDate":"14-16 Dec. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5373586","isNumber":"5383051","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5373586","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5383051","articleId":"5383318","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5383334,"authors":[{"name":"B.

A new approach is offered for visualizing and exploring a query-based subset of multiple heterogeneous biomedical databases. Databases are modeled as an entity-relation graph containing nodes (database records) and links (relationships between records). Users specify a keyword search string to retrieve an initial set of nodes, and then explore intra- and interdatabase links. Results are visualized with user-defined semantic substrates to take advantage of the rich set of attributes usually present in biomedical data. Comments from domain experts indicate that this visualization method is potentially advantageous for biomedical knowledge exploration.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 January 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"March-April  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5383347/","volume":"8","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/5383347/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11742957","isJournal":true,"pubMedId":"21233530","publicationDate":"March-April 2011","dateOfInsertion":"13 January 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Visual Exploration across Biomedical Databases","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Visual Exploration across Biomedical Databases","sourcePdf":"ttb2011020536.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.080732S","chronDate":"March-April  2011","xplore-pub-id":"8857","isNumber":"5686865","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8857","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"5686865","articleId":"5383347","onlineDate":"15 January 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5383350,"authors":[{"name":"Li-Pin Chang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/12/5557296/5383350/5383350-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Li-Pin Chang received the BE degree in computer science and information engineering from I-Shou University, Taiwan, in 1995, and the MSE and PhD degrees in computer science and information engineering from the National Taiwan University, in 1997 and 2003, respectively.

One important SSD design issue is achieving a good balance between cost, performance, and lifetime. This study introduces a hybrid approach to large SSDs that combines MLC NAND flash and SLC NAND flash. Each of these flash architectures has its own drawbacks and benefits, and this study proposes that the two can complement each other. However, there are technical challenges pertaining to data placement, data migration, and wear leveling in heterogeneous NAND flash. The experimental results of our study show that combining 256 MB SLC flash with 20 GB MLC flash produces a hybrid SSD. This hybrid SSD is 1.8 times faster than a purely MLC-flash-based SSD in terms of average response time and improves energy consumption by 46 percent. The proposed hybrid SSD costs only four percent more than a purely MLC-flash-based SSD. The extra cost of a hybrid SSD is very limited and rewarding.","doi":"10.1109/TC.2010.14","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TC.2010.14","startPage":"1337","endPage":"1349","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/12/5557296/05383350.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5557296","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Hybrid Approach to NAND-Flash-Based Solid-State Disks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5383350/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 January 2010","displayDocTitle":"A Hybrid Approach to NAND-Flash-Based Solid-State Disks","volume":"59","issue":"10","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"26 August 2010","accessionNumber":"11498733","publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5383350/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Hybrid Approach to NAND-Flash-Based Solid-State Disks","sourcePdf":"ttc2010101337.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.108651S","chronDate":"Oct.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"12","isNumber":"5557296","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"55","xplore-issue":"5557296","articleId":"5383350","onlineDate":"15 January 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5383352,"authors":[{"name":"Jinyuan Sun","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of Tennessee, Knoxville, TN, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/71/5522945/5383352/5383352-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jinyuan Sun received the BSc degree in computer information systems from Beijing Information Technology Institute, China, in 2003, the MASc degree in computer networks from Ryerson University, Canada, in 2005, and the PhD degree in electrical and computer engineering from the University of Florida, in 2010.

Attacking and misusing such network could cause destructive consequences. It is therefore necessary to integrate security requirements into the design of VANETs and defend VANET systems against misbehavior, in order to ensure correct and smooth operations of the network. In this paper, we propose a security system for VANETs to achieve privacy desired by vehicles and traceability required by law enforcement authorities, in addition to satisfying fundamental security requirements including authentication, nonrepudiation, message integrity, and confidentiality. Moreover, we propose a privacy-preserving defense technique for network authorities to handle misbehavior in VANET access, considering the challenge that privacy provides avenue for misbehavior. The proposed system employs an identity-based cryptosystem where certificates are not needed for authentication. We show the fulfillment and feasibility of our system with respect to the security goals and efficiency.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Identity-Based Security System for User Privacy in Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","doi":"10.1109/TPDS.2010.14","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/71/5522945/05383352.pdf","startPage":"1227","endPage":"1239","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPDS.2010.14","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5522945","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5383352","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5383352/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 January 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2010","displayDocTitle":"An Identity-Based Security System for User Privacy in Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"21","issue":"9","htmlLink":"/document/5383352/","dateOfInsertion":"26 July 2010","publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","accessionNumber":"11447028","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Identity-Based Security System for User Privacy in Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks","sourcePdf":"ttd2010091227.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.166788S","chronDate":"Sept.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"71","isNumber":"5522945","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"71","citationCount":"196","xplore-issue":"5522945","articleId":"5383352","onlineDate":"15 January 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":5383364,"authors":[{"name":"Unsang Park","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Michigan State University, East Lansing, MI, USA"],"firstName":"Unsang","lastName":"Park","id":"37400212000"},{"name":"Yiying Tong","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Michigan State University, East Lansing, MI, USA"],"firstName":"Yiying","lastName":"Tong","id":"38103584500"},{"name":"Anil K.

In other words, the goal is to come up with a representation and matching scheme that is robust to changes due to facial aging. Facial aging is a complex process that affects both the 3D shape of the face and its texture (e.g., wrinkles). These shape and texture changes degrade the performance of automatic face recognition systems. However, facial aging has not received substantial attention compared to other facial variations due to pose, lighting, and expression. We propose a 3D aging modeling technique and show how it can be used to compensate for the age variations to improve the face recognition performance. The aging modeling technique adapts view-invariant 3D face models to the given 2D face aging database. The proposed approach is evaluated on three different databases (i.g., FG-NET, MORPH, and BROWNS) using FaceVACS, a state-of-the-art commercial face recognition engine.","doi":"10.1109/TPAMI.2010.14","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel5/34/5432924/05383364.pdf","startPage":"947","endPage":"954","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPAMI.2010.14","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5432924","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Age-Invariant Face Recognition","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5383364","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 January 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5383364/","displayDocTitle":"Age-Invariant Face Recognition","volume":"32","issue":"5","publicationDate":"May 2010","accessionNumber":"11180468","pubMedId":"20299717","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5383364/","dateOfInsertion":"18 March 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Age-Invariant Face Recognition","sourcePdf":"ttp2010050947.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.086658S","chronDate":"May  2010","xplore-pub-id":"34","isNumber":"5432924","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"246","xplore-issue":"5432924","articleId":"5383364","onlineDate":"15 January 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5383365,"authors":[{"name":"Zhaoshui He","affiliation":["Laboratory for Advanced Brain Signal Processing, RIKEN Brain Science Institute, Wako, Saitama, Japan","School of Electronic and Information Engineering, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/34/5618480/5383365/5383365-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Zhaoshui He received the BS degree in applied mathematics from Hunan Normal University, Changsha, China, in 2000, and the PhD degree in electronics and information engineering from South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, China, in 2005.

To fill this gap, this problem is investigated based on n-way algebraic theory in this paper. A simple, yet efficient, detection method is proposed by eigenvalue decomposition (EVD), which is easy to implement. We justify this method. In addition, its effectiveness is demonstrated by the experiments on both simulated and real-world data sets.","doi":"10.1109/TPAMI.2010.15","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel5/34/5618480/05383365.pdf","startPage":"2006","endPage":"2021","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPAMI.2010.15","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5618480","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Detecting the Number of Clusters in n-Way Probabilistic Clustering","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5383365","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 January 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5383365/","displayDocTitle":"Detecting the Number of Clusters in n-Way Probabilistic Clustering","volume":"32","issue":"11","publicationDate":"Nov. 2010","accessionNumber":"11623473","pubMedId":"20847390","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5383365/","dateOfInsertion":"01 November 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Detecting the Number of Clusters in n-Way Probabilistic Clustering","sourcePdf":"ttp2010112006.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.193557S","chronDate":"Nov.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"34","isNumber":"5618480","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"104","xplore-issue":"5618480","articleId":"5383365","onlineDate":"15 January 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-27"},{"_id":5383373,"authors":[{"name":"Vahid Garousi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Calgary, Calgary, AB, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/32/5644729/5383373/5383373-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Vahid Garousi received the BSc degree from Sharif University of Technology in 2000, the MSc degree from the University of Waterloo in 2003, and the PhD degree in software engineering from Carleton University in 2006.

However, since evolutionary algorithms are heuristic, their performance can vary across multiple executions, which may affect robustness and scalability. To address this, we present the design and technical detail of a UML-driven, GA-based stress test requirements generation tool, together with its empirical analysis. The main goal is to analyze and improve the applicability, efficiency, and effectiveness and also to validate the design choices of the GA used in the tool. Findings of the empirical evaluation reveal that the tool is robust and reasonably scalable when it is executed on large-scale experimental design models. The study also reveals the main bottlenecks and limitations of the tools, e.g., there is a performance bottleneck when the system under test has a large number of sequence diagrams which could be triggered independently from each other. In addition, issues specific to stress testing, e.g., the impact of variations in task arrival pattern types, reveal that the tool generally generates effective test requirements, although the features of those test requirements might be different in different runs (e.g., different stress times from the test start time might be chosen). While the use of evolutionary algorithms to generate software test cases has been widely reported, the extent, depth, and detail of the empirical findings presented in this paper are novel and suggest that the proposed approach is effective and efficient in generating stress test requirements. It is hoped that the findings of this empirical study will help other SBSE researchers with the empirical evaluation of their own techniques and tools.","doi":"10.1109/TSE.2010.5","startPage":"778","endPage":"797","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSE.2010.5","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5644729","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/32/5644729/05383373.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Genetic Algorithm-Based Stress Test Requirements Generator Tool and Its Empirical Evaluation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5383373/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A Genetic Algorithm-Based Stress Test Requirements Generator Tool and Its Empirical Evaluation","volume":"36","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/5383373/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11673964","publicationDate":"Nov.-Dec. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"29 November 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.-Dec.  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 January 2010","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Genetic Algorithm-Based Stress Test Requirements Generator Tool and Its Empirical Evaluation","sourcePdf":"tts2010060778.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.095549S","chronDate":"Nov.-Dec.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"32","isNumber":"5644729","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"32","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"5644729","articleId":"5383373","onlineDate":"15 January 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":5383385,"authors":[{"name":"Raymond H.

But it's an art which is yet to achieve perfection. The major challenge being faced by it is the intelligence and computational capability of the hacker. All these years the scientists have been working on increasing the computational complexity, but the recent concept of quantum cryptography has added a complete new dimension to this field. The strength of this cryptographic technique comes from the fact that no one can read (`steal') the information without altering its content. This alteration Alerts! the communicators about the possibility of a hacker and thus promising a highly secure data transfer. Due to this advantage, quantum cryptography has grasped a great deal of attention and huge amount of research is being carried out on it. But is quantum the ultimate solution to information security? Will classical cryptography persist? Are all those quantum theory practicable and are there methods for cracking quantum cryptography? All such questions have resulted into the making of this paper. This paper discusses in detail about the versatility of classical cryptography which ensures it an infinite future and the various limitations of quantum cryptography which detains it from becoming the `ultimate solution'. For example... The course of development of all future technologies are mostly directed towards the `wireless', and quantum security for wireless networks is a serious question mark, whereas the classical side is completely independent of the medium of communication. Further, quantum cryptography doesn't support digital signature (fully supported by classical cryptography) which is very vital when it comes to information or key exchange through a shared network. Another main problems faced by quantum cryptography is the transmission distance. It has not exceed 150 Km, and most of the optic fibers which are in current use will attenuate a photon within a much lesser distance. This means a lot of practical problems. To overcome this scientist are working on `Quantum Repeaters' which will serve as a booster for the quantum information. But this will return fire because the hackers can use the same tool as a weapon to steal the information without their presence being discovered thus breaking quantum's main advantage. This new concept of quantum cryptography has come into light and it's now time to decide for the researchers and the consumers as to where they put their money! The study helps solve this issue by bringing out the actual picture of the present developments in quantum and classical cryptography and also discusses in detail about what's in store for the future in these two different cryptographic fields. We emphasis on the various advantages that classical cryptography holds over quantum cryptography and finally we prove that classical and quantum are not like the cassettes and CDs.","doi":"10.1109/ICECS.2009.21","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5383458","startPage":"333","endPage":"337","pdfPath":"/iel5/5383383/5383458/05383498.pdf","publicationTitle":"2009 Second International Conference on Environmental and Computer Science","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Second International Conference on Environmental and Computer Science","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICECS.2009.21","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Limitations of Quantum & the Versatility of Classical Cryptography: A Comparative Study","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cryptography","Computer hacking","Information security","Quantum mechanics","Protection","Art","Computational intelligence","Computational complexity","Quantum computing","Communication system security"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["quantum cryptography"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["quantum limitation","classical cryptography","quantum cryptography","information security","digital signature"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["quantum cryptography","classical cryptography","cryptography"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"28-30 Dec. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Limitations of Quantum & the Versatility of Classical Cryptography: A Comparative Study","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5383498/","dateOfInsertion":"15 January 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5383498/","accessionNumber":"11085433","publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","conferenceDate":"28-30 Dec. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Limitations of Quantum & the Versatility of Classical Cryptography: A Comparative Study","confLoc":"Dubai, United Arab Emirates","sourcePdf":"3937a333.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049232S","chronDate":"28-30 Dec. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5383383","isNumber":"5383458","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5383383","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"5383458","articleId":"5383498","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5383588,"authors":[{"name":"Xuanwu Zhou","affiliation":["Key Lab. of Network & Inf.

The one-way trapdoor function is based on ECDLP (elliptic curves discrete logarithm problem), so the algorithms of the scheme take great advantage of the superiority of ECC, such as high efficiency, short key length and etc. The scheme not only reinforces the security and stability of signcryption but also effectively improves the efficiency of signcryption for software and hardware application.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Elliptic curve cryptography","Elliptic curves","Information security","Public key cryptography","Knowledge engineering","Educational institutions","Hardware","Application software","Authentication","Protocols"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["digital signatures","public key cryptography"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["signcryption scheme","public verifiability","signature authentication","encryption transmission","message transmission","elliptic curves cryptosystem","trustable third party","elliptic curves discrete logarithm problem"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["signcryption","public verification","message recovery","trustable third party","coalition attack"]}],"doi":"10.1109/KESE.2009.54","publicationTitle":"2009 Pacific-Asia Conference on Knowledge Engineering and Software Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Pacific-Asia Conference on Knowledge Engineering and Software Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/5383382/5383567/05383591.pdf","startPage":"178","endPage":"181","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5383567","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/KESE.2009.54","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improved Signcryption Scheme with Public Verifiability","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5383591","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Improved Signcryption Scheme with Public Verifiability","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5383591/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5383591/","accessionNumber":"11085356","conferenceDate":"19-20 Dec. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"15 January 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-20 Dec. 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improved Signcryption Scheme with Public Verifiability","confLoc":"Shenzhen, China","sourcePdf":"3916a178.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051743S","chronDate":"19-20 Dec. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5383382","isNumber":"5383567","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5383382","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"5383567","articleId":"5383591","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-19"},{"_id":5383600,"authors":[{"name":"Li Xian Wei","affiliation":["Computer and Communication College of Hunan University, Hunan University, Changsha, China"],"firstName":"Li Xian","lastName":"Wei","id":"38256587600"},{"name":"Yang Sheng","affiliation":["Computer and Communication College of Hunan University, Hunan University, Changsha, China"],"firstName":"Yang","lastName":"Sheng","id":"38252873100"},{"name":"Wang Qi","affiliation":["Computer and Communication College of Hunan University, Hunan University, Changsha, China"],"firstName":"Wang","lastName":"Qi","id":"38257478400"},{"name":"Li Ming","affiliation":["Computer and Communication College of Hunan University, Hunan University, Changsha, China"],"firstName":"Li","lastName":"Ming","id":"38259303700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5324-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3916-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5383600","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":195},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Face recognition","Wavelet transforms","Principal component analysis","Support vector machines","Support vector machine classification","Lighting","Pattern recognition","Feature extraction","Discrete wavelet transforms","Wavelet analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["face recognition","principal component analysis","support vector machines","wavelet transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["face recognition","wavelet transform","PCA","SVM","support vector machine","Cambridge ORL face database","principal component analysis","images preprocessing"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["wavelet transform","pca","face recognition","svm"]}],"abstract":"A novel technique for face recognition is presented in this paper. wavelet transform, PCA and SVM are combined in this technique. wavelet transform is used for preprocessing the images in order to handle bad illumination.

In general, the single-ended amplifier section in balanced amplifiers is not matched perfectly, so the reflected input power is terminated conventionally at the isolation port of branch line hybrid coupler. However in this work, the reflected power is injected into the auxiliary amplifier, and its output power is combined to the output power of balanced amplifier. Therefore final output power, power gain, and efficiency performances of the proposed balanced amplifier are highly improved compared to the conventional balanced amplifier. For the verification of the proposed balanced amplifier, a conventional balanced amplifier and the proposed balanced amplifier are fabricated and measured, and the measured results are compared.

As well as validating RF models in a complete functional IC, we also introduce flexible active building cells, i.e. intermediate merged cascode cells (MCC) and cross couple pairs (CCP). A good match between measurements and simulations of a MCC and CCP verify the accuracy and reliability of foundry provided RF models. To further demonstrate the CS effect on UCS design in RF applications, a single ended 5 GHz LNA is implemented with first pass design success. Measured results match well with post-simulations. The LNA delivers state-of-the-art performance, with a NF of 3\u00b10.5 dB and 16 dB gain. The 1-dB compression point of -3 dBm is achieved with a supply current of 13 mA. The methodology presented here should be applicable to other technology nodes. A 90-nm CMOS process has been used in the current work.","doi":"10.1109/RFIT.2009.5383740","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Symposium on Radio-Frequency Integration Technology (RFIT)","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Symposium on Radio-Frequency Integration Technology (RFIT)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5375727/5383653/05383740.pdf","startPage":"261","endPage":"264","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5383653","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RFIT.2009.5383740","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robust 90-nm RF CMOS device models for RFIC design","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5383740/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan. 9 2009-Dec. 11 2009","displayDocTitle":"Robust 90-nm RF CMOS device models for RFIC design","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5383740/","dateOfInsertion":"15 January 2010","publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","accessionNumber":"11072754","conferenceDate":"9 Jan.-11 Dec. 2009","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust 90-nm RF CMOS device models for RFIC design","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"117.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071977S","chronDate":"Jan. 9 2009-Dec. 11 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5375727","isNumber":"5383653","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5375727","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5383653","articleId":"5383740","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5383741,"authors":[{"name":"Aya Mabrouki","affiliation":["Cours la Lib\u00e9ration, IMS Laboratory, Talence, France"],"firstName":"Aya","lastName":"Mabrouki","id":"37847809500"},{"name":"Thierry Taris","affiliation":["Cours la Lib\u00e9ration, IMS Laboratory, Talence, France"],"firstName":"Thierry","lastName":"Taris","id":"37400145300"},{"name":"Yann Deval","affiliation":["Cours la Lib\u00e9ration, IMS Laboratory, Talence, France"],"firstName":"Yann","lastName":"Deval","id":"37277062400"},{"name":"Jean-Baptiste Begueret","affiliation":["Cours la Lib\u00e9ration, IMS Laboratory, Talence, France"],"firstName":"Jean-Baptiste","lastName":"Begueret","id":"37276436400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5031-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-5032-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5383741","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":411},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Low-noise amplifiers","CMOS technology","Noise measurement","Linearity","Threshold voltage","Linearization techniques","Energy consumption","Wireless sensor networks","Transconductance","MOSFETs"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS integrated circuits","low noise amplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS low-noise amplifier linearization","body biasing","LNA","third order intercept point","wireless sensor network applications","size 0.13 mum","frequency 2.4 GHz","gain 12.6 dB","noise figure 4.2 dB","current 3.4 mA","noise figure 9 dB","noise figure 6.2 dB","voltage 1 V","voltage -0.55 V","power 2 mW"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5383741","doi":"10.1109/RFIT.2009.5383741","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RFIT.2009.5383741","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5383653","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Symposium on Radio-Frequency Integration Technology (RFIT)","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Symposium on Radio-Frequency Integration Technology (RFIT)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5375727/5383653/05383741.pdf","startPage":"150","endPage":"153","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"CMOS low-noise amplifier linearization through body biasing","abstract":"A new linearization technique for CMOS low-noise amplifiers (LNAs) based on body biasing is presented.

Nevertheless, the cognitive users do not transmit data or voice all the time, and the idle cognitive users may consume massive spectrum sensing power instead of communication power. Therefore, we propose a partial FFT spectrum sensing method to reduce the cooperative spectrum sensing power. Moreover, we present two techniques, called detection result prediction (DRP) and decision result modification (DRM), to increase the detection accuracy based on the frequency-domain correlation and detection diversity. Simulation results show that the proposed technique can not only save about 50% computational complexity but also improve the detection performance.","doi":"10.1109/ISPACS.2009.5383782","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Symposium on Intelligent Signal Processing and Communication Systems (ISPACS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5374432/5383749/05383782.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5383749","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISPACS.2009.5383782","publicationTitle":"2009 International Symposium on Intelligent Signal Processing and Communication Systems (ISPACS)","startPage":"546","endPage":"549","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cooperative partial spectrum sensing with frequency diversity for cognitive radio","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5383782","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-9 Jan. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Cooperative partial spectrum sensing with frequency diversity for cognitive radio","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5383782/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5383782/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","accessionNumber":"11133414","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2010","conferenceDate":"7-9 Jan. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cooperative partial spectrum sensing with frequency diversity for cognitive radio","confLoc":"Kanazawa, Japan","sourcePdf":"WP1A3.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057758S","chronDate":"7-9 Jan. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5374432","isNumber":"5383749","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5374432","xplore-issue":"5383749","articleId":"5383782","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":5383784,"authors":[{"name":"Jongmoon Kim","affiliation":["Gwangju Institute of Science and Technology, South Korea"],"firstName":"Jongmoon","lastName":"Kim","id":"38108081500"},{"name":"Junil Ahn","affiliation":["Gwangju Institute of Science and Technology, South Korea"],"firstName":"Junil","lastName":"Ahn","id":"37673864100"},{"name":"Kiseon Kim","affiliation":["Gwangju Institute of Science and Technology, South Korea"],"firstName":"Kiseon","lastName":"Kim","id":"37280247300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5015-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-5016-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5383784","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":76},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Detectors","Quantization","Bit error rate","Receiving antennas","Quadrature amplitude modulation","Transmitting antennas","Maximum likelihood detection","MIMO","Signal processing","Amplitude modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["maximum likelihood detection","MIMO communication","OFDM modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["improved lattice-reduction-aided detector","added search signals","quantization error","MIMO-OFDM systems","lattice-reduction-aided detectors","nonideal decision region","outlying constellation points","shortest distance","received signal","bit error performance","full search maximum-likelihood detection"]}],"abstract":"This paper describes approaches to the problem that lattice-reduction-aided (LRA) detectors have non-ideal decision region and detect outlying constellation points.

The proposed scheme detects its position of impulsive noise in the OFDM observation period by making use of guard frequency band. The impulse noise is then blocked according to the detected position. Although the blocking could cancel the impulse noise component, it also disturbs the orthogonality amongst sub-carriers. This implies that the performance could be degraded due to inter-carrier interference (ICI) caused by the blocking. In order to reduce the effect of ICI, raised cosine shaped function is employed.

Lattice placement of pixels intrinsically has directional dependency on the clarity of image representation; in other words, the image clarity is significantly dependent on the directions of the objects in the image, such as lines. For example, horizontal lines are perfectly represented by lattice pixels, while slanted lines have jagged edges. In this paper, we propose a pseudorandom pixel placement architecture for clear imaging with solving the directional dependency problems. We also discuss our evaluation of its characteristics based on the designed layout of CMOS image sensor with pseudorandom pixel placement, as well as its implementation.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Symposium on Intelligent Signal Processing and Communication Systems (ISPACS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5374432/5383749/05383826.pdf","startPage":"367","endPage":"370","publicationTitle":"2009 International Symposium on Intelligent Signal Processing and Communication Systems (ISPACS)","doi":"10.1109/ISPACS.2009.5383826","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISPACS.2009.5383826","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5383749","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5383826","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A CMOS image sensor with pseudorandom pixel placement for clear imaging","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["CMOS image sensors","Lattices","Image sensors","PSNR","Retina","Digital cameras","Image resolution","Smart pixels","Image representation","Displays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CCD image sensors","CMOS image sensors","image representation","image resolution"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS image sensor","pseudorandom pixel placement","picture element","CCD image sensors","lattice placement","image representation","image clarity","lattice pixels","directional dependency problems"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5383826/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-9 Jan. 2009","displayDocTitle":"A CMOS image sensor with pseudorandom pixel placement for clear imaging","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5383826/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","accessionNumber":"11086302","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2010","conferenceDate":"7-9 Jan. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A CMOS image sensor with pseudorandom pixel placement for clear imaging","confLoc":"Kanazawa, Japan","sourcePdf":"TP1C5.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063918S","chronDate":"7-9 Jan. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5374432","isNumber":"5383749","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5374432","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5383749","articleId":"5383826","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":5383835,"authors":[{"name":"Miin-Jong Hao","affiliation":["Department of Computer and Communication Engineering, National Kaohsiung First University of Science and Technology, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Miin-Jong","lastName":"Hao","id":"37417911800"},{"name":"Chiu-Hsiung Lai","affiliation":[""],"firstName":"Chiu-Hsiung","lastName":"Lai","id":"37672057100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5015-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-5016-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5383835","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":118},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Peak to average power ratio","Signal processing","Bit error rate","OFDM modulation","Constellation diagram","Quadrature phase shift keying","Quadrature amplitude modulation","High power amplifiers","Radio transmitters","Fluctuations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["error statistics","low-power electronics","OFDM modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["PAPR reduction","adjustable circle constrain","OFDM systems","active constellation extension","instantaneous power","OFDM signals","BER"]}],"abstract":"Active constellation extension (ACE) is an effective and credibly method to reduce the ratio of the instantaneous power to the average power (PAPR) of the OFDM signals.

Conventional carrier diversity (CD) receiver requires multiple FFT processors and corresponding number of channel estimators according to the increase of the number of diversity antennas. On the other hand, only one FFT processor is need in a pre-FFT antenna array (AA) receiver, and the AA can improve the instantaneous signal-to-interference-and-noise ratio (SINR) at the input of the FFT. As a result, the accuracy of channel estimation can be improved after FFT. In this paper, a hybrid AA/CD receiver's performance tradeoff with complexity is analyzed. The hybrid receiver can halve the number of the FFT processors by comparing with the conventional CD receiver.

It is known that the time domain maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) scheme out-performs the conventional frequency domain channel estimation; however, the performance degradation becomes noticeable at low SNRs. Although we proposed a singular-value truncation approach for the MLE to improve the performance, we have been required more performance improvement in noisy environment. A minimum mean square error (MMSE) estimation is a promising technique to improve the performance in the low SNRs. However, we need considerable efforts to carry out the time domain MMSE channel estimation because it requires statistical information such as power delay profiles of MIMO channels in advance. Concerning this issue, we propose to construct the covariance matrix of the channels by using the estimated power delay profiles given by the MLE in every frames, and solve a normal equation by using the conjugate gradient method (CGM). Simulation results will show some packet error rate performances of an MIMO-OFDM system when we apply these channel estimation schemes.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Time domain channel estimation schemes for OFDM systems with multiple antenna transmissions","publicationTitle":"2009 International Symposium on Intelligent Signal Processing and Communication Systems (ISPACS)","doi":"10.1109/ISPACS.2009.5383860","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Symposium on Intelligent Signal Processing and Communication Systems (ISPACS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5374432/5383749/05383860.pdf","startPage":"232","endPage":"235","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISPACS.2009.5383860","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5383749","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5383860","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5383860/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-9 Jan. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Time domain channel estimation schemes for OFDM systems with multiple antenna transmissions","conferenceDate":"7-9 Jan. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5383860/","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2010","publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","accessionNumber":"11133441","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Time domain channel estimation schemes for OFDM systems with multiple antenna transmissions","confLoc":"Kanazawa, Japan","sourcePdf":"TA2A3.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.085846S","chronDate":"7-9 Jan. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5374432","isNumber":"5383749","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5374432","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5383749","articleId":"5383860","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5383863,"authors":[{"name":"Parichat Sermwuthisarn","affiliation":["Chulalongkom University, Bangkok, Thailand"],"firstName":"Parichat","lastName":"Sermwuthisarn","id":"37590651000"},{"name":"Supatana Auethavekiat","affiliation":["Chulalongkom University, Bangkok, Thailand"],"firstName":"Supatana","lastName":"Auethavekiat","id":"37295545900"},{"name":"Vorapoj Patanavijit","affiliation":["Assumption University, Bangkok, Thailand"],"firstName":"Vorapoj","lastName":"Patanavijit","id":"37300535000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5015-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-5016-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5383863","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":12,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":569},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image coding","Matching pursuit algorithms","Size measurement","Pixel","Linear programming","Sparse matrices","Signal processing","Communication systems","Signal processing algorithms","Testing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data compression","image coding","image matching"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image recovery","compressive sensing","block based orthogonal matching pursuit","block based OMP","image block","PSNR"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5383863","abstract":"Traditionally, the problems of applying orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP) to large images are its high computing time and its requirement for a large matrix.

Compared to standard OMP, block based OMP required less computing time while giving comparable PSNR.","doi":"10.1109/ISPACS.2009.5383863","publicationTitle":"2009 International Symposium on Intelligent Signal Processing and Communication Systems (ISPACS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Symposium on Intelligent Signal Processing and Communication Systems (ISPACS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5374432/5383749/05383863.pdf","startPage":"212","endPage":"215","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISPACS.2009.5383863","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5383749","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A fast image recovery using compressive sensing technique with block based Orthogonal Matching Pursuit","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A fast image recovery using compressive sensing technique with block based Orthogonal Matching Pursuit","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2010","accessionNumber":"11086346","publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5383863/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5383863/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-9 Jan. 2009","conferenceDate":"7-9 Jan. 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A fast image recovery using compressive sensing technique with block based Orthogonal Matching Pursuit","confLoc":"Kanazawa, Japan","sourcePdf":"MP2D3.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067098S","chronDate":"7-9 Jan. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5374432","isNumber":"5383749","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5374432","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"5383749","articleId":"5383863","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5383869,"authors":[{"name":"Franz A. de Leon","affiliation":["University of Philippines, Philippines"],"firstName":"Franz A.","lastName":"de Leon","id":"37301615400"},{"name":"Leonardo A.

Minimum Mean Square Error (MMSE) channel estimation has been known as a superior performance channel estimation. However, this algorithm has high computational complexity. In this paper, we present low complexity partial-sampled MMSE channel estimation for compromising between complexity and performance. We reduced MMSE channel estimation complexity by partially sampling the MMSE weight matrix. The simulation results show that the bit error rate (BER) performance significantly improved over the least square channel estimation and has comparable BER performance with MMSE channel estimation at low SNR. Depending the sixze of sampling, significant decrease 57 % to 64 % in computational complexity can be achieved.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Low complexity partial sampled MMSE channel estimation for downlink OFDMA IEEE 802.16e system","publicationTitle":"2009 International Symposium on Intelligent Signal Processing and Communication Systems (ISPACS)","doi":"10.1109/ISPACS.2009.5383875","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Symposium on Intelligent Signal Processing and Communication Systems (ISPACS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5374432/5383749/05383875.pdf","startPage":"162","endPage":"166","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISPACS.2009.5383875","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5383749","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5383875","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5383875/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-9 Jan. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Low complexity partial sampled MMSE channel estimation for downlink OFDMA IEEE 802.16e system","conferenceDate":"7-9 Jan. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5383875/","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2010","publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","accessionNumber":"11086319","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low complexity partial sampled MMSE channel estimation for downlink OFDMA IEEE 802.16e system","confLoc":"Kanazawa, Japan","sourcePdf":"MP2A3.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.083957S","chronDate":"7-9 Jan. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5374432","isNumber":"5383749","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5374432","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5383749","articleId":"5383875","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5383877,"authors":[{"name":"Hiroyuki Hayashi","affiliation":["Nagoya Institute of Technology, Nagoya, Japan"],"firstName":"Hiroyuki","lastName":"Hayashi","id":"38104431200"},{"name":"Eiji Okamoto","affiliation":["Nagoya Institute of Technology, Nagoya, Japan"],"firstName":"Eiji","lastName":"Okamoto","id":"37074851100"},{"name":"Yasunori Iwanami","affiliation":["Nagoya Institute of Technology, Nagoya, Japan"],"firstName":"Yasunori","lastName":"Iwanami","id":"37297405600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5015-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-5016-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5383877","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":335},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fading","OFDM","Scattering","Frequency estimation","Delay estimation","Channel estimation","Wiener filter","Performance evaluation","Computer simulation","Delay effects"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","fading channels","fast Fourier transforms","multipath channels","OFDM modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fading channel estimation","OFDM","sparse pilot symbol","scattered pilot symbol","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","multipath fading","frequency selective fading","FFT","adaptive order switching","fast Fourier transform"]}],"abstract":"OFDM (orthogonal frequency division multiplexing) can utilize one-tap equalization for multipath (frequency selective) fading and is widely used in many wireless systems today. However, according to the demand for high-mobility communication and the use of higher carrier frequency, the influence of time selectivity of fading is increasing. Therefore, an accurate channel estimation of time and frequency selective fading is important for OFDM systems. To achieve this requirement, we have proposed a fading estimation scheme FFT to scattered pilot symbols in OFDM. However, the estimation accuracy of this scheme changes by the estimation order of the time and frequency direction, maximum Doppler frequency, and delay spread of fading. Therefore, in this paper, we propose an efficient fast fading channel estimation scheme for OFDM with an adaptive order switching. The performances of the proposed scheme are evaluated by computer simulations.","doi":"10.1109/ISPACS.2009.5383877","publicationTitle":"2009 International Symposium on Intelligent Signal Processing and Communication Systems (ISPACS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Symposium on Intelligent Signal Processing and Communication Systems (ISPACS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5374432/5383749/05383877.pdf","startPage":"154","endPage":"157","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISPACS.2009.5383877","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5383749","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A fast fading channel estimation scheme for OFDM with sparse and scattered pilot symbols","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5383877","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-9 Jan. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5383877/","displayDocTitle":"A fast fading channel estimation scheme for OFDM with sparse and scattered pilot symbols","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","accessionNumber":"11086293","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5383877/","conferenceDate":"7-9 Jan. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A fast fading channel estimation scheme for OFDM with sparse and scattered pilot symbols","confLoc":"Kanazawa, Japan","sourcePdf":"MP2A1.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061693S","chronDate":"7-9 Jan. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5374432","isNumber":"5383749","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5374432","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5383749","articleId":"5383877","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5383879,"authors":[{"name":"Li-Der Jeng","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Chung Yuan Christian University, Chungli, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Li-Der","lastName":"Jeng","id":"37408150200"},{"name":"Fan-Wei Meng","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Chung Yuan Christian University, Chungli, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Fan-Wei","lastName":"Meng","id":"38113948200"},{"name":"Chia-Cheng Yang","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Chung Yuan Christian University, Chungli, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chia-Cheng","lastName":"Yang","id":"38106424300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5015-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-5016-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5383879","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":219},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Digital signal processing","Narrowband","Interference cancellation","Ultra wideband technology","Signal processing algorithms","OFDM","WiMAX","Digital signal processors","Fixed-point arithmetic","Statistics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["digital signal processing chips","fixed point arithmetic","floating point arithmetic","interference suppression","OFDM modulation","radiofrequency interference","statistical analysis","ultra wideband communication","WiMax"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["narrowband interference cancellation","MB-OFDM based ultra-wideband communication system","multiband orthogonal frequency division multiplexing ultra-wideband system","coexistence communication system","worldwide interoperability for microwave access","WiMAX","MB-OFDM UWB system","digital signal processor","NBI cancellation","floating-point arithmetic","fixed-point arithmetic","TMS320C6713 DSP Starter Kit","statistics"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["multiband orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","ultra-wideband","digital signal processor","narrow-band interference"]}],"abstract":"The multiband orthogonal frequency division multiplexing ultra-wideband (MB-OFDM UWB) system suffered from the narrowband interference (NBI) due to the presence of coexistence communication system, such as worldwide interoperability for microwave access (WiMAX).

First, the 2D dual-tree discrete wavelet transform is applied to an image to produce 2 wavelet trees with complementary information. A noise-shaping algorithm is then employed to remove the redundancies of both trees and form the basic parts of two descriptions. A side noise shaping algorithm is proposed to draw the supplementary information for side decoding from the other tree. Basic information from one tree and supplementary from the other tree are grouped to form a description. Two descriptions are then dispatched from different channels. Because every description includes critical information of the picture, the reconstructed image from any single channel can have acceptable fidelity. The reconstructed image is of much better quality if both channels are available. Simulation results have demonstrated the performance of the proposed algorithm.","doi":"10.1109/ISPACS.2009.5383887","publicationTitle":"2009 International Symposium on Intelligent Signal Processing and Communication Systems (ISPACS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Symposium on Intelligent Signal Processing and Communication Systems (ISPACS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5374432/5383749/05383887.pdf","startPage":"655","endPage":"658","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISPACS.2009.5383887","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5383749","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multiple description image coding using dual-tree discrete wavelet transform","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5383887","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-9 Jan. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5383887/","displayDocTitle":"Multiple description image coding using dual-tree discrete wavelet transform","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","accessionNumber":"11133419","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5383887/","conferenceDate":"7-9 Jan. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multiple description image coding using dual-tree discrete wavelet transform","confLoc":"Kanazawa, Japan","sourcePdf":"MP1B5.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.040634S","chronDate":"7-9 Jan. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5374432","isNumber":"5383749","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5374432","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"5383749","articleId":"5383887","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5383896,"authors":[{"name":"Zhixiang Chen","affiliation":["Graduate School of Information, Production and Systems, Waseda University, Japan"],"firstName":"Zhixiang","lastName":"Chen","id":"37536706200"},{"name":"Xiongxin Zhao","affiliation":["Graduate School of Information, Production and Systems, Waseda University, Japan"],"firstName":"Xiongxin","lastName":"Zhao","id":"37539425200"},{"name":"Xiao Peng","affiliation":["Graduate School of Information, Production and Systems, Waseda University, Japan"],"firstName":"Xiao","lastName":"Peng","id":"37310543000"},{"name":"Dajiang Zhou","affiliation":["Graduate School of Information, Production and Systems, Waseda University, Japan"],"firstName":"Dajiang","lastName":"Zhou","id":"37403106700"},{"name":"Satoshi Goto","affiliation":["Graduate School of Information, Production and Systems, Waseda University, Japan"],"firstName":"Satoshi","lastName":"Goto","id":"37279993400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5015-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-5016-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5383896","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":281},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5383896","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Parity check codes","Decoding","Phase change materials","Throughput","Electronic mail","Error correction codes","Bit error rate","Hardware","Code standards","Intelligent networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decoding","IEEE standards","parity check codes","wireless LAN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["high-parallelism reconfigurable permutation network","IEEE 802.11n LDPC decoder","IEEE 802.16e LDPC decoder","Benes network"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ISPACS.2009.5383896","endPage":"88","startPage":"85","publicationTitle":"2009 International Symposium on Intelligent Signal Processing and Communication Systems (ISPACS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Symposium on Intelligent Signal Processing and Communication Systems (ISPACS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5374432/5383749/05383896.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISPACS.2009.5383896","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5383749","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A high-parallelism reconfigurable permutation network for IEEE 802.11n??802.16e LDPC decoder","abstract":"In this paper, we proposed a high-parallelism permutation network (PN) based on Benes network (BN) for LDPC decoder applied for IEEE 802.11n and 802.16e standards.

A victim who visits such a malicious web page will be compromised. Therefore, an efficient malicious web detection method is needed to prevent users from being compromised. Based on our observation, malicious web pages have uncommon behavior in order to evade from detection of Antivirus software. The anomaly behavior such as code encoding makes malicious web pages different from normal benign web pages. Current researches have noticed pattern-matching approach is not suitable to detect malicious web pages anymore, and then proposes a new detection method. The proposed method, a client-side malicious web page detection method, is based on anomaly behavior analysis. It focuses on distinguishing the behavior difference between malicious and benign web pages.

We show that for a MMSE equalizer operating at low to medium SNR's, the number of Rake fingers is the dominant factor to improve system performance, while at high SNR's the number of equalizer taps plays a more significant role in reducing error rates.","doi":"10.1109/NetCoM.2009.51","publicationTitle":"2009 First International Conference on Networks & Communications","startPage":"349","endPage":"353","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NetCoM.2009.51","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5383944","pdfPath":"/iel5/5379701/5383944/05383963.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 First International Conference on Networks & Communications","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["RAKE receivers","Ultra wideband communication","Decision feedback equalizers","Fingers","Performance analysis","Fading","Diversity reception","System performance","Error analysis","Multipath channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["error statistics","intersymbol interference","Monte Carlo methods","personal area networks","radio receivers","ultra wideband communication","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["time domain equalization technique","RAKE-MMSE receivers","high data rate UWB communication system","RAKE fingers","equalizer taps","intersymbol interference","semianalytical approach","Monte-Carlo simulation","IEEE 802.15.3a UWB channel models","error rate reduction"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["UWB","Rake Receiver","LE","DFE","Bit Error Rate"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Time Domain Equalization Technique Using RAKE-MMSE Receivers for High Data Rate UWB Communication System","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5383963/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5383963/","accessionNumber":"11073686","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"15 January 2010","publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","conferenceDate":"27-29 Dec. 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"27-29 Dec. 2009","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Time Domain Equalization Technique Using RAKE-MMSE Receivers for High Data Rate UWB Communication System","confLoc":"Chennai, India","sourcePdf":"3924a349.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.07173S","chronDate":"27-29 Dec. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5379701","isNumber":"5383944","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5379701","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5383944","articleId":"5383963","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":5384079,"authors":[{"name":"Chuah Zheng Ming","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Malaya, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia"],"lastName":"Chuah Zheng Ming","id":"37087352488"},{"name":"Paramesran Raveendran","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Malaya, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Paramesran","lastName":"Raveendran","id":"37298441100"},{"name":"Poh Sin Chew","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of Malaya, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Poh Sin","lastName":"Chew","id":"37063949600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4763-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4764-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1947-1386"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1947-1394"}],"articleNumber":"5384079","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":375},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Least squares methods","Neural networks","Blood","Sugar","Spectroscopy","Diode lasers","Patient monitoring","Raman scattering","Diabetes","Wavelength measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biochemistry","blood","infrared spectra","laser applications in medicine","least squares approximations","neural nets","semiconductor lasers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["partial least squares","neural network","noninvasive blood glucose concentration monitoring system","laser diodes","NIR spectra","oral glucose tolerance test","partial least squares model","nonlinearity","Durbin-Watson test","time 4 day","wavelength 1500 nm to 1800 nm","power 6 mW"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5384079","abstract":"A non-invasive blood glucose monitoring system with six laser diodes is used to obtain a total of 290 NIR spectra from the Oral Glucose Tolerance Test (OGTT) experiment with the participation of a healthy volunteer over 4 days.

Many notable research results have been obtained, such as virtual receive array (VRA) concept for orthogonal waveform transmitting MIMO radar. The mono-static MIMO radar proposed in this paper shares the same transmit and receive antenna array, so it is very similar to conventional transmit/receive (T/R) digital beamforming (DBF) radar. The VRA concept can be easily extended to T/R DBF radar system by re-designing the antenna array structure. In this paper, an optimal antenna array design for mono-static MIMO radar is proposed in order to improve the interferences rejection capabilities. The minimum redundancy array (MRA) concept is also used to maximize the antenna virtual aperture for an array of given numbers of elements. Simulation results show that compared with the T/R DBF radar, the proposed monostatic MIMO radar can effectively improve the interferences rejection capabilities, especially the mainlobe interferences rejection capabilities.

Especially, mobile terminals such as mobile phones are actively developed. In developments of mobile terminals, miniaturization and frequency multiband of antennas are very important issues. However, there are no rational design strategy in small antenna designs. So, antenna developments depends on electromagnetic simulators or capability of engineer. And many cut-and-try processes are necessary for achieving desired characteristic. This makes many problems such as prolongation of developments. Then, now, automatic design techniques of antenna using genetic algorithm (GA) are paid attention. In this paper, the new design strategy for miniaturization of antennas is proposed by operation of chromosome-length in GA. Proposed design technique provides a minimum area necessary for keeping characteristics of a antenna. And, efficient miniaturization of a antenna and removing many undesirable conductors in a design ares are possible. Removing undesirable conductors provides lower-cost designing of antennas. The new design method can become rational design strategy for antennas miniaturization.","doi":"10.1109/APMC.2009.5384162","startPage":"1837","endPage":"1840","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Asia Pacific Microwave Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5374440/5384114/05384162.pdf","publicationTitle":"2009 Asia Pacific Microwave Conference","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APMC.2009.5384162","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5384114","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient antenna miniaturization technique by cut off of chromosome-length in genetic algorithm","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Biological cells","Genetic algorithms","Mobile handsets","Mobile antennas","Conductors","Frequency","Algorithm design and analysis","Design methodology","Wireless LAN","Shape"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithms","mobile antennas","mobile handsets","multifrequency antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["efficient antenna miniaturization technique","chromosome-length","genetic algorithm","mobile terminals","mobile phones","frequency multiband","electromagnetic simulators"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["genetic algorithm","antenna design","miniaturization"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5384162/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-10 Dec. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Efficient antenna miniaturization technique by cut off of chromosome-length in genetic algorithm","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5384162/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2010","conferenceDate":"7-10 Dec. 2009","accessionNumber":"11087443","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient antenna miniaturization technique by cut off of chromosome-length in genetic algorithm","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"4691256.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058148S","chronDate":"7-10 Dec. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5374440","isNumber":"5384114","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5374440","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5384114","articleId":"5384162","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5384181,"authors":[{"name":"Xia Liu","affiliation":["School of ITEE, University of Queensland, Saint Lucia, QLD, Australia"],"firstName":"Xia","lastName":"Liu","id":"37406554700"},{"name":"Feng Wang","affiliation":["School of ITEE, University of Queensland, Saint Lucia, QLD, Australia"],"firstName":"Feng","lastName":"Wang","id":"37403440900"},{"name":"Konstanty Bialkowski","affiliation":["NICTAR-Queensland Laboratory, Brisbane, QLD, Australia"],"firstName":"Konstanty","lastName":"Bialkowski","id":"37284407800"},{"name":"Marek E.

The sampling frequency is set so that a phase relationship of the sampling point of an alias signal generated by sampling a carrier at a sampling frequency lower than that of a carrier coincides with a phase relationship of the sampling point of the carrier. We call this sampling \u00bfRF direct orthogonal phase under-sampling\u00bf. Using this sampling, both I-channel and Q-channel information can be obtained directly. The only drawback of the sampling is it must be precisely timed so that it is synchronized with the input RF carrier. Therefore, we have developed a new synchronization technique between samplings and RF carrier modulated with 16-QAM. To prove the validity of our technique, we have demonstrated demodulating the 16-QAM signal by using receiver simulations on Matlab.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Asia Pacific Microwave Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5374440/5384114/05384187.pdf","startPage":"508","endPage":"511","publicationTitle":"2009 Asia Pacific Microwave Conference","doi":"10.1109/APMC.2009.5384187","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APMC.2009.5384187","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5384114","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5384187","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Demodulation of 16-QAM signals using RF direct orthogonal phase under-sampling technique","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Demodulation","RF signals","Radio frequency","Sampling methods","Frequency synchronization","Software standards","Circuits","Phase modulation","Digital modulation","Signal generators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["demodulation","quadrature amplitude modulation","signal sampling","synchronisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["16-QAM signal demodulation","RF direct orthogonal phase","sampling technique","higher-order modulation signal","digital receiver architecture","sampling frequency","carrier frequency","Q-channel information","I-channel information","synchronization technique","receiver simulations","Matlab","alias signal sampling"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Demodulation","digital radio","frequency control","quadrature amplitude modulation","sampling methods"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5384187/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-10 Dec. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Demodulation of 16-QAM signals using RF direct orthogonal phase under-sampling technique","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5384187/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","accessionNumber":"11087171","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2010","conferenceDate":"7-10 Dec. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Demodulation of 16-QAM signals using RF direct orthogonal phase under-sampling technique","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"1291385.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.096712S","chronDate":"7-10 Dec. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5374440","isNumber":"5384114","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5374440","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5384114","articleId":"5384187","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5384190,"authors":[{"name":"Krishna Agarwal","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, National University of Singapore, Singapore"],"firstName":"Krishna","lastName":"Agarwal","id":"37399757000"},{"name":"Xudong Chen","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, National University of Singapore, Singapore"],"firstName":"Xudong","lastName":"Chen","id":"37403977200"},{"name":"Yu Zhong","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, National University of Singapore, Singapore"],"firstName":"Yu","lastName":"Zhong","id":"37895304600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2801-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2802-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2165-4727"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2165-4743"}],"articleNumber":"5384190","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":87},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sampling methods","Electromagnetic scattering","Inverse problems","Testing","Electromagnetic radiation","Engine cylinders","Lighting","Dielectric measurements","Wavelength measurement","Electromagnetic measurements"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electromagnetic wave scattering","sampling methods","shapes (structures)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["linear sampling method","qualitative inversion technique","imaging scatterers","induced multipoles","physical interpretation","monopole current","induced current","mathematical model","two-dimensional scalar electromagnetic scattering","infinitely extending dielectric cylinders"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Inverse scattering","linear sampling method","multipole expansion","reconstruction"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5384190","abstract":"Linear sampling method is a qualitative inversion technique employed for imaging scatterers.

This article presents a physical interpretation of the linear sampling method. We demonstrate that linear sampling method can effectively be understood as finding the locations in the domain, where the monopole current is the most significant part of the induced current. To this end, we have provided a new mathematical formulation in terms of the induced multipoles which is equivalent to LSM. We further show that this mathematical model can be used to enhance the imaging results.","doi":"10.1109/APMC.2009.5384190","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APMC.2009.5384190","startPage":"500","endPage":"503","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Asia Pacific Microwave Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5374440/5384114/05384190.pdf","publicationTitle":"2009 Asia Pacific Microwave Conference","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5384114","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Interpretation of linear sampling method in terms of induced multipoles","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"7-10 Dec. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Interpretation of linear sampling method in terms of induced multipoles","conferenceDate":"7-10 Dec. 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2010","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5384190/","accessionNumber":"11087092","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5384190/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Interpretation of linear sampling method in terms of induced multipoles","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"1271345.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046272S","chronDate":"7-10 Dec. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5374440","isNumber":"5384114","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5374440","xplore-issue":"5384114","articleId":"5384190","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5384203,"authors":[{"name":"Ibrahim Haroun","affiliation":["Carleton University, Ottawa, Canada","Communications Rcscarch Centre, Canada"],"firstName":"Ibrahim","lastName":"Haroun","id":"37396526100"},{"name":"Yuan-Chia Hsu","affiliation":["Chip Implementation Center, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Yuan-Chia","lastName":"Hsu","id":"37573809300"},{"name":"Jim Wight","affiliation":["Carleton University, Ottawa, Canada"],"firstName":"Jim","lastName":"Wight","id":"37300061600"},{"name":"Calvin Plett","affiliation":["Carleton University, Ottawa, Canada"],"firstName":"Calvin","lastName":"Plett","id":"37271515800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2801-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2802-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2165-4727"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2165-4743"}],"articleNumber":"5384203","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":92},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5384203","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Low-noise amplifiers","Planar waveguides","Millimeter wave measurements","Transceivers","Testing","Noise figure","Gain","Frequency","Power measurement","Energy consumption"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS analogue integrated circuits","low noise amplifiers","millimetre wave integrated circuits","transceivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["vertical planar waveguide matching elements","wireless systems","millimeter-wave transceivers","input third-order intercept","CMOS single-stage low-noise amplifier","size 90 nm","frequency 57 GHz to 58 GHz","power 15.2 mW","voltage 1.5 V"]}],"abstract":"A 90-nm CMOS single-stage low-noise amplifier with vertical planar waveguide (VPW) matching elements for use in millimeter-wave (mmW) transceivers has been developed and tested.

The modulators encode the source signal into a binary level pulse train, and broaden the application of class-D amplifiers to include signals with time-varying envelopes. Their performance are directly linked to the power efficiency and linearity of the overall amplifier. The modulators are evaluated in terms of two important parameters, coding efficiency and average transition frequency. Tested at 800MHz with a 5MHz W-CDMA signal having a 10.6dB peak-to-average ratio and a class-D amplifier constructed using GaAs FET devices, it is found that the amplifier achieves a power efficiency of 21% with Neoteric modulator, compared to an efficiency of 11% with bandpass \u03a3\u0394 modulator, while with comparable level spectral growth of around \u221245dBc. The better power efficiency obtained with Neoteric modulator is due to its higher coding efficiency of 11.4% versus 5.8% for the bandpass \u03a3\u0394 modulator.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5384294/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-10 Dec. 2009","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"7-10 Dec. 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5384294/","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2010","publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Performance comparison of RF class-D amplifier with Neoteric modulator and bandpass sigma-delta modulator","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance comparison of RF class-D amplifier with Neoteric modulator and bandpass sigma-delta modulator","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"4341867.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.040347S","chronDate":"7-10 Dec. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5374440","isNumber":"5384114","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5374440","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5384114","articleId":"5384294","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":5384309,"authors":[{"name":"Wen-An Tsou","affiliation":["Department of Electronics Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Wen-An","lastName":"Tsou","id":"37605286400"},{"name":"Che-Sheng Chen","affiliation":["Department of Electronics Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Che-Sheng","lastName":"Chen","id":"37406727700"},{"name":"Chun-Kai Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electronics Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chun-Kai","lastName":"Wang","id":"37715943200"},{"name":"Kevin C.

For the convenience of applying different antenna, the working band of that system is wide. And the automatic 3-D capable rotating system is designed to obtain the complete channel model while previous measurements mostly can only achieve the 2-D channel response. Furthermore, the antennas with different polarization can also applied in the transmit/receive end to construct the channel model with polarization. Beamforming arithmetic is used in data processing to improve the angle discrimination of the system. For the indoor radio channel is considered quasi-static, the system can be used for measurements of indoor radio channel. The measurement using this system has been carried out, and the measurement results confirm the system to be helpful and applicable for measurements of indoor channel.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Asia Pacific Microwave Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5374440/5384114/05384379.pdf","startPage":"1084","endPage":"1087","publicationTitle":"2009 Asia Pacific Microwave Conference","doi":"10.1109/APMC.2009.5384379","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APMC.2009.5384379","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5384114","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5384379","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Measurement system for indoor multi-polarized MIMO channel","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Antenna measurements","Rotation measurement","Indoor radio communication","Receiving antennas","Transmitting antennas","Distortion measurement","Polarization","Mutual coupling","Antenna arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","directive antennas","indoor radio","MIMO communication","spatial variables measurement","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["measurement system","indoor multi-polarized MIMO channel","3-D spatial response","channel response data","indoor radio channel","rotating directivity antennas","deterioration factors","mutual coupling","pattern distortion","antenna array","beamforming arithmetic","data processing","angle discrimination"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["channel measurements","wireless MIMO","polarization diversity","spatial multiplexing","multi-polarized channel"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5384379/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-10 Dec. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Measurement system for indoor multi-polarized MIMO channel","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5384379/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","accessionNumber":"11087079","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2010","conferenceDate":"7-10 Dec. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Measurement system for indoor multi-polarized MIMO channel","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"2751736.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057181S","chronDate":"7-10 Dec. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5374440","isNumber":"5384114","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5374440","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5384114","articleId":"5384379","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5384383,"authors":[{"name":"Xuan Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, National University of Singapore, Singapore"],"firstName":"Xuan","lastName":"Wang","id":"37966534100"},{"name":"Hon Tat Hui","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, National University of Singapore, Singapore"],"firstName":"Hon Tat","lastName":"Hui","id":"37284824900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2801-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2802-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2165-4727"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2165-4743"}],"articleNumber":"5384383","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":197},"abstract":"The MIMO capacity for a single cell multiple-input and six outputs multiuser MIMO system is investigated. The channel model consists of an antenna array at each mobile terminal, the Rayleigh fading channel from the user to the base station, and also an antenna array at base station. The channel state information (CSI) is assumed to be always known at the base station, thus successive decoding for multiuser can be utilized. It is found that the capacity drops when antenna mutual coupling becomes severe with smaller antenna separations at the user terminals. Simulation results also indicate that as the number of antennas used by mobile terminals doubles or triples, or as the cochannel user group in the cell enlarges, the total channel capacity significantly increases. Simulation results of some typical examples are presented to illustrate our findings.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Asia Pacific Microwave Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5374440/5384114/05384383.pdf","startPage":"1096","endPage":"1099","publicationTitle":"2009 Asia Pacific Microwave Conference","doi":"10.1109/APMC.2009.5384383","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APMC.2009.5384383","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5384114","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5384383","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Capacity for the uplink channel of a single cell multiuser MIMO systems with antenna mutual coupling effect included","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Mutual coupling","Transmitting antennas","Computational modeling","Loaded antennas","Mobile antennas","Base stations","Receiving antennas","Antenna arrays","Channel capacity"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","channel capacity","decoding","MIMO communication","mobile radio","Rayleigh channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["uplink channel capacity","single cell multiuser MIMO systems","antenna mutual coupling effect","MIMO capacity","antenna array","mobile terminal","Rayleigh fading channel","channel state information","multiuser decoding"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Multiuser MIMO system","channel capacity","channel correlation","multiple-access channel (MAC)","antenna array"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5384383/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-10 Dec. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Capacity for the uplink channel of a single cell multiuser MIMO systems with antenna mutual coupling effect included","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5384383/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","accessionNumber":"11086913","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2010","conferenceDate":"7-10 Dec. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Capacity for the uplink channel of a single cell multiuser MIMO systems with antenna mutual coupling effect included","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"2781705.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.040149S","chronDate":"7-10 Dec. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5374440","isNumber":"5384114","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5374440","xplore-issue":"5384114","articleId":"5384383","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5384385,"authors":[{"name":"Salman Parsa","affiliation":["Department of Mathematical Sciences, Sharif University of technology, Tehran, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Salman","lastName":"Parsa","id":"37544670600"},{"name":"Amir Ahmad Shishegar","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering Department, Sharif University of technology, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Amir Ahmad","lastName":"Shishegar","id":"37298373600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2801-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2802-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2165-4727"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2165-4743"}],"articleNumber":"5384385","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":117},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Ray tracing","Acceleration","Geometry","Testing","Electromagnetic propagation","Layout","Computational modeling","Computer simulation","Life estimation","Computer graphics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electromagnetic wave propagation","ray tracing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electromagnetic wave propagation","ray tracing acceleration technique","kd-tree"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["electromagnetic propagation","ray tracing","intersection test","acceleration"]}],"abstract":"In this paper we deal with ray tracing acceleration problem in wave propagation simulation as a separate problem from its computer graphical counterpart and try to review accelerating techniques with this point of view.

In addition, a push-pull structure and a negative feedback network have been adopted for the broadband operation which has been implemented using broadband coaxial transmission line transformers and a broadband high-Q RF choke inductor. It is shown from the experimental results presented that the implemented power amplifier exhibits an output power at the 1dB compression point (P1dB) of more than 5 W, as well as having a power-added efficiency of more than 43% at P1dB over the entire operational frequency band from 2 to 500 MHz.

This is done by incorporating a quasi-static FDTD solution, Floquet periodic boundary conditions and modified PML boundary conditions to achieve microdosimetric modelling of bioelectromagnetic interactions at cellular level. Particular attention is paid to exploration of the field distribution over the membrane layer of the biological cells. The method enables the analysis of a large structure of cells in a more computationally efficient way than the modelling of the entire structure. An example is given to prove the stability of the proposed subgridding FDTD. The total fields of the simulated structures are shown to give reasonable and stable results at 2450MHz.","doi":"10.1109/APMC.2009.5384423","publicationTitle":"2009 Asia Pacific Microwave Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Asia Pacific Microwave Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5374440/5384114/05384423.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APMC.2009.5384423","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5384114","startPage":"1533","endPage":"1536","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Precise computation of the induced fields inside biological cell tissue using floquet boundary and subgridding quasi-static FDTD method","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5384423","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Precise computation of the induced fields inside biological cell tissue using floquet boundary and subgridding quasi-static FDTD method","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-10 Dec. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5384423/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"7-10 Dec. 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","accessionNumber":"11087076","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5384423/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Precise computation of the induced fields inside biological cell tissue using floquet boundary and subgridding quasi-static FDTD method","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"3911955.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056284S","chronDate":"7-10 Dec. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5374440","isNumber":"5384114","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5374440","xplore-issue":"5384114","articleId":"5384423","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5384444,"authors":[{"name":"Gurpreet Singh","affiliation":["Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"firstName":"Gurpreet","lastName":"Singh","id":"37536734000"},{"name":"Eng Leong Tan","affiliation":["Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"firstName":"Eng Leong","lastName":"Tan","id":"37272187200"},{"name":"Zhi Ning Chen","affiliation":["Institute for Infocomm Research, Singapore"],"firstName":"Zhi Ning","lastName":"Chen","id":"37421295100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2801-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2802-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2165-4727"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2165-4743"}],"articleNumber":"5384444","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":264},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Finite difference methods","Electromagnetic scattering","Time domain analysis","Lattices","Maxwell equations","Analytical models","Electromagnetic analysis","Electromagnetic propagation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electromagnetic wave propagation","electromagnetic wave scattering","finite difference time-domain analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["2D LOD-FDTD method","total-field-scattered-field technique","FDTD lattice","finite difference time domain method"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) methods","total-field/scattered-field (TF/SF) technique","locally one-dimensional (LOD) method"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents an implementation of the total-field/scattered-field (TF/SF) technique in the 2-D LOD-FDTD method.

One of the most commonly used neural networks, namely the multilayer perceptrons (MLP) could sometimes fail to model highly nonlinear input-output behaviors accurately. Advanced neural networks (e.g. knowledge based neural networks) can be employed; however, such networks suffer from an increased complexity both in terms of their structures and training methods.

Two models of different beam tunnel cross-section, i.e. cylindrical and rectangular, were simulated. It was found that the rectangular tunnel model is similar to the cylindrical tunnel model in cold-test properties, when the transverse square side length is 85% to the diameter of the cylindrical tunnel. The three-dB bandwidth is 40.6 GHz and the maximum gain is 15.8 dB at 393.3 GHz, for an 18.5 mm-long (60 periods) loss-free circuit, predicted by Pierce small signal theory. Particle-in-cell simulation also revealed the three-dB bandwidth of ~35 GHz and ~30 GHz for cylindrical-tunnel model and rectangular-tunnel model, respectively, for a 29.6 mm-long (96 periods) loss-free circuit with concentrated attenuator. It is also found that the gain of rectangular-tunnel model is about 5 dB lower than that of cylindrical-tunnel model, for 29.6 mm-long circuit.

Finally, some vitro animal tissue experiments have been taken to validate the numerical analysis.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Thermal distribution analysis in bio-tissues during microwave ablation with FDTD method","publicationTitle":"2009 Asia Pacific Microwave Conference","doi":"10.1109/APMC.2009.5384503","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Asia Pacific Microwave Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5374440/5384114/05384503.pdf","startPage":"1405","endPage":"1408","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APMC.2009.5384503","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5384114","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5384503","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5384503/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-10 Dec. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Thermal distribution analysis in bio-tissues during microwave ablation with FDTD method","conferenceDate":"7-10 Dec. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5384503/","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2010","publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","accessionNumber":"11087024","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Thermal distribution analysis in bio-tissues during microwave ablation with FDTD method","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"3581337.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065561S","chronDate":"7-10 Dec. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5374440","isNumber":"5384114","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5374440","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5384114","articleId":"5384503","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5384529,"authors":[{"name":"YongJu Suh","affiliation":["Graduate School of Information, Production and Systems, Waseda University, Kitakyushu, Japan"],"firstName":"YongJu","lastName":"Suh","id":"37850511500"},{"name":"Jiangtao Sun","affiliation":["Graduate School of Information, Production and Systems, Waseda University, Kitakyushu, Japan"],"firstName":"Jiangtao","lastName":"Sun","id":"37407523000"},{"name":"Koji Horie","affiliation":["Semiconductor company, Toshiba Corporation, Kawasaki, Japan"],"firstName":"Koji","lastName":"Horie","id":"37845403800"},{"name":"Nobuyuki Itoh","affiliation":["Semiconductor company, Toshiba Corporation, Kawasaki, Japan"],"firstName":"Nobuyuki","lastName":"Itoh","id":"37301349400"},{"name":"Toshihiko Yoshimasu","affiliation":["Graduate School of Information, Production and Systems, Waseda University, Kitakyushu, Japan"],"firstName":"Toshihiko","lastName":"Yoshimasu","id":"37301350100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2801-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2802-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2165-4727"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2165-4743"}],"articleNumber":"5384529","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":418},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["High power amplifiers","MOSFET circuits","Voltage","Linearity","Gain","CMOS technology","Power generation","Impedance matching","CMOS process","Circuit synthesis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS integrated circuits","MMIC","power amplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["high efficiency linear CMOS power amplifier","electric toll collection","high linear gain performance","cascode PA","class E PA","power added efficiency","matching circuits","frequency 5.8 GHz","size 130 nm","voltage 2 V","gain 11.4 dB"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["CMOS","Electric Toll Collection","Power amplifier","High efficiency"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5384529","doi":"10.1109/APMC.2009.5384529","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APMC.2009.5384529","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5384114","publicationTitle":"2009 Asia Pacific Microwave Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Asia Pacific Microwave Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5374440/5384114/05384529.pdf","startPage":"365","endPage":"368","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fully-integrated novel high efficiency linear CMOS power amplifier for 5.8 GHz ETC applications","abstract":"A fully integrated novel power amplifier (PA) using 130 nm CMOS process is presented for electric toll collection (ETC) applications.

Novelties of this paper are summarized as follows. (1) Filtration of particles is robust against pressure fluctuation in microchannels rather than using only hydrodynamic force because particles are separated mechanically, (2) Clogging of the microparticles could be avoided by rotation of the 3D-MMT in a mcirochamber, (3) Size-classified microparticles can be trapped along the gaps in microchannels by flow control. Microparticles having different sizes flow in spiral microchannels and filtered according to their sizes by gaps between gaps and substrate by centrifugal force. Microparticles larger than the gap cannot pass through the gap and are kept flowing in the inner microchannel. Rotation of the 3D-MMT by magnetic force from an external magnetic circuit generates swirling flow in the microchamber. Size-classified microparticles can be trapped in microchannel by closing the drain port of the target particle. Trapped particles can be measured by direct observation and treated by reagent. After the experiment, trapped particles are extracted by open the drain ports. We successfully demonstrated microparticle filtration and microparticle trap of filtered particles in the developed microfluidic chip.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5384565/","chronOrPublicationDate":"29-29 Jan. 2009","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"29-29 Jan. 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5384565/","dateOfInsertion":"05 April 2010","publicationDate":"Nov. 2009","accessionNumber":"11227305","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Size-dependent filtration and trapping of microparticle in a microfluidic chip using centrifugal force and a graduated mechanical gap","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Size-dependent filtration and trapping of microparticle in a microfluidic chip using centrifugal force and a graduated mechanical gap","confLoc":"Tokyo, Japan","sourcePdf":"A02.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063312S","chronDate":"29-29 Jan. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5374434","isNumber":"5384538","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5374434","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5384538","articleId":"5384565","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":5384568,"authors":[{"name":"Weihong Wang","affiliation":["University of New South Wales, Australia","NICTA, Australia"],"firstName":"Weihong","lastName":"Wang","id":"37599755800"},{"name":"Chunhua Shen","affiliation":["NICTA, Australia","Australian National University, Australia"],"firstName":"Chunhua","lastName":"Shen","id":"37274255300"},{"name":"Jian Zhang","affiliation":["University of New South Wales, Australia","NICTA, Australia"],"firstName":"Jian","lastName":"Zhang","id":"38196109900"},{"name":"Sakrapee Paisitkriangkrai","affiliation":["University of New South Wales, Australia","NICTA, Australia"],"firstName":"Sakrapee","lastName":"Paisitkriangkrai","id":"37658975900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5297-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-3866-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5384568","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":15,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":621},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Vehicle detection","Vehicles","Object detection","Detectors","Merging","Cameras","Traffic control","Filters","Subtraction techniques","Pixel"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Haar transforms","object detection","traffic engineering computing","vehicles"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["vehicle headlight detection","Haar feature","AdaBoost framework","two-layer night-time vehicle detector"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["vehicle detection","headlight detector","Adaboost"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5384568","doi":"10.1109/DICTA.2009.33","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DICTA.2009.33","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5384566","publicationTitle":"2009 Digital Image Computing: Techniques and Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Digital Image Computing: Techniques and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5384537/5384566/05384568.pdf","startPage":"162","endPage":"167","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Two-Layer Night-Time Vehicle Detector","abstract":"We present a two-layer night time vehicle detector in this work.

Instead, such solutions relate only to the combination of the items' weight and the fraction derived with the greedy policy applied. This results in iZHKnap's strong competitive performance as well as in solving the Sub-set sum problem.","doi":"10.1109/IFCSTA.2009.162","publicationTitle":"2009 International Forum on Computer Science-Technology and Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Forum on Computer Science-Technology and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5384535/5384569/05384612.pdf","startPage":"167","endPage":"171","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IFCSTA.2009.162","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5384569","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Improved Iterated Local Search Algorithm for Invest Strongly Correlated 0/1 Knapsack Problem","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5384612","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-27 Dec. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5384612/","displayDocTitle":"An Improved Iterated Local Search Algorithm for Invest Strongly Correlated 0/1 Knapsack Problem","volume":"2","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","accessionNumber":"11104443","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5384612/","conferenceDate":"25-27 Dec. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Improved Iterated Local Search Algorithm for Invest Strongly Correlated 0/1 Knapsack Problem","confLoc":"Chongqing, China","sourcePdf":"3930b167.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.091805S","chronDate":"25-27 Dec. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5384535","isNumber":"5384569","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5384535","xplore-issue":"5384569","articleId":"5384612","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5384727,"authors":[{"name":"Li Zhengquan","affiliation":["NMC Research Laboratory, South-East University, Nanjing, China","Information Engineering College, Yangzhou University, Yangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Li","lastName":"Zhengquan","id":"37697735300"},{"name":"Shen Lianfeng","affiliation":["NMC Research Laboratory, South-East University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Shen","lastName":"Lianfeng","id":"37400067700"},{"name":"Wang Jingjing","affiliation":["Information Engineering College, Yangzhou University, Yangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Wang","lastName":"Jingjing","id":"37395475100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5423-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5422-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3930-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5384727","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":192},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Block codes","Relays","Maximum likelihood decoding","Space time codes","Fading","Educational institutions","Laboratories","Transmitting antennas","Bit error rate","Performance analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["encoding","error statistics","maximum likelihood decoding","orthogonal codes","space-time codes","transmitting antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decode-and-forward relay networks","single-antenna users","quasi-orthogonal space time block code matrix","maximum-likelihood decoding algorithm","decoded symbol encoding","transmit antenna","pair-wise decoding algorithm","BER","gain 4 dB","gain 1.8 dB","gain 4.5 dB","gain 3.5 dB"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["space time block code","decode-and-forward","bit error rate","maximum-likelihood decoding algorithm","pair-wise decoding algorithm"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5384727","doi":"10.1109/IFCSTA.2009.252","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IFCSTA.2009.252","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5384698","publicationTitle":"2009 International Forum on Computer Science-Technology and Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Forum on Computer Science-Technology and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5384535/5384698/05384727.pdf","startPage":"58","endPage":"61","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Quasi-orthogonal Space Time Block Code for Decode-and-Forward Relay Networks","abstract":"A kind of quasi-orthogonal space time block code for decode-and-forward relay networks is analyzed in this paper.

In this paper, we propose and analyze different algorithms for DfP tracking in a typical indoor WLAN environment, rich in multipath. We also study the effect of the temporal and spatial changes in the environment on the accuracy of the system. In addition, we evaluate the effect of the different configurations of the wireless equipment placement on the DfP localization accuracy. Our results show that our proposed techniques can accurately track the user in typical environments, thus enabling a large number of DfP applications.","doi":"10.1109/NTMS.2009.5384738","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NTMS.2009.5384738","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 3rd International Conference on New Technologies, Mobility and Security","pdfPath":"/iel5/5384533/5384652/05384738.pdf","publicationTitle":"2009 3rd International Conference on New Technologies, Mobility and Security","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5384652","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis of a Device-Free Passive Tracking System in Typical Wireless Environments","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"20-23 Dec. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Analysis of a Device-Free Passive Tracking System in Typical Wireless Environments","conferenceDate":"20-23 Dec. 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2010","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5384738/","accessionNumber":"11087542","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5384738/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis of a Device-Free Passive Tracking System in Typical Wireless Environments","confLoc":"Cairo, Egypt","sourcePdf":"pid992818.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058116S","chronDate":"20-23 Dec. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5384533","isNumber":"5384652","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5384533","citationCount":"42","xplore-issue":"5384652","articleId":"5384738","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":5384750,"authors":[{"name":"Vandana D.

In this work we propose an enhanced fractional frequency reuse (EFFR) scheme combined with power allocation and an interference-aware reuse mechanism to achieve not only ICI limitation at cell edge but also enhancement of overall cell capacity in orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) based communication networks. The EFFR scheme divides the whole available bandwidth into a primary segment and a secondary segment. The exclusive reuse-3 subchannels in the primary segment will be prior used by cell-edge users with higher transmission power, whereas the remaining subchannels are all reuse-1 subchannels allowing to be used with lower power. In addition, the resources in the Secondary Segment will be occupied by means of signal-to-interference-ratio (SINR) estimation. We implement the proposed EFFR scheme in a system-level simulator and compare its performance with the well-known Soft Frequency Reuse (SFR) scheme and the classical reuse-1 scheme. In order to investigate the impact on the performance by power allocation, schemes are simulated with various power masks, and using a scenario with surrounding cells up to 2nd-tier. Simulation results show that the EFFR scheme is more flexible and robust than the SFR scheme, and can gain substantial improvements in terms of both, the overall cell capacity as well as the cell-edge user performance.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 3rd International Conference on New Technologies, Mobility and Security","pdfPath":"/iel5/5384533/5384652/05384757.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","publicationTitle":"2009 3rd International Conference on New Technologies, Mobility and Security","doi":"10.1109/NTMS.2009.5384757","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NTMS.2009.5384757","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5384652","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5384757","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Enhanced Fractional Frequency Reuse to Increase Capacity of OFDMA Systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interference","Bandwidth","Frequency conversion","Resource management","Costs","Data communication","Cellular networks","Radio spectrum management","Communication networks","Signal to noise ratio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","frequency division multiplexing","interference (signal)","multi-access systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["OFDMA systems","intercell interference mitigation","cellular systems","enhanced fractional frequency reuse","interference-aware reuse mechanism","orthogonal frequency division multiple access","signal-to-interference-ratio estimation","system-level simulator","soft frequency reuse"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5384757/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-23 Dec. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Enhanced Fractional Frequency Reuse to Increase Capacity of OFDMA Systems","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5384757/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","accessionNumber":"11133723","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2010","conferenceDate":"20-23 Dec. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Enhanced Fractional Frequency Reuse to Increase Capacity of OFDMA Systems","confLoc":"Cairo, Egypt","sourcePdf":"pid992784.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044408S","chronDate":"20-23 Dec. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5384533","isNumber":"5384652","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5384533","citationCount":"32","xplore-issue":"5384652","articleId":"5384757","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5384788,"authors":[{"name":"Song Kai","affiliation":["Information Science and Engineering College, Shen Yang Ligong University, Shenyang, China"],"firstName":"Song","lastName":"Kai","id":"37595280300"},{"name":"Niu Hui-ping","affiliation":["Info.

The propagation of acoustic signals in submarine media is possible with very low frequency signal carriers only, therefore reduced bandwidth, low transmission rates, thus extending transmission duration and diminishing battery life. Requirements to increase transmission data rates for UWSN have made it attractive to explore the possibilities of higher frequency EM transmissions. Recent experiments show that huge EM signal losses are to be expected in the near field of the transmitting antenna, however experiencing little additional reductions thereafter. The lack of a unified simple analytical model based on Maxwell's equations that can be used as a design tool for these wireless submarine links, validated against published experimental results, is a problem that has been solved in this paper.","doi":"10.1109/NTMS.2009.5384789","publicationTitle":"2009 3rd International Conference on New Technologies, Mobility and Security","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 3rd International Conference on New Technologies, Mobility and Security","pdfPath":"/iel5/5384533/5384652/05384789.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NTMS.2009.5384789","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5384652","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Radio Communication Model for Underwater WSN","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5384789","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-23 Dec. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5384789/","displayDocTitle":"Radio Communication Model for Underwater WSN","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","accessionNumber":"11133731","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5384789/","conferenceDate":"20-23 Dec. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Radio Communication Model for Underwater WSN","confLoc":"Cairo, Egypt","sourcePdf":"pid992690.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065131S","chronDate":"20-23 Dec. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5384533","isNumber":"5384652","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5384533","citationCount":"28","xplore-issue":"5384652","articleId":"5384789","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-22"},{"_id":5384826,"authors":[{"name":"Sana Tmar Ben Hamida","affiliation":["CEA-LETI/MINATEC, Grenoble, France","CEA, MINATEC, Grenoble, France"],"firstName":"Sana Tmar","lastName":"Ben Hamida","id":"38108756600"},{"name":"Jean-Benoit Pierrot","affiliation":["CEA-LETI/MINATEC, Grenoble, France","CEA, MINATEC, Grenoble, France"],"firstName":"Jean-Benoit","lastName":"Pierrot","id":"37396679800"},{"name":"Claude Castelluccia","affiliation":["INRIA Rh\u00f4ne-Alpes, Saint Ismier Cedex, France"],"firstName":"Claude","lastName":"Castelluccia","id":"37298585000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6273-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4765-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-6272-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2157-4952"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2157-4960"}],"articleNumber":"5384826","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":30,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":544},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Quantization","Fluctuations","Physical layer","Character generation","Information security","Ultra wideband technology","Data mining","Robustness","Wireless sensor networks","Interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cryptography","ultra wideband communication","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive quantization","secret key generation","radio channel measurement","radio channel characteristics","reciprocity principle","channel fluctuation","indoor environment","binary vectors","secret bits extraction","ultra wide band technology"]}],"abstract":"New approaches that generate secret keys from radio channel characteristics have been recently proposed. The security of these schemes usually relies on the reciprocity principle which states that the channel fluctuations can be a source of common randomness for two communicating peers and these fluctuations can't be measured by any eavesdropper. A validation of these properties for indoor environments is presented in this work. The shared keys are created by measuring the reciprocal channel features and converting this information to binary vectors using a quantization algorithm. This paper addresses the problem of quantization. It identifies an important weakness of existing key generation algorithms and it shows that the secret bits extraction has a significant impact on the robustness and security of these algorithms. A new adaptive quantization algorithm for secret key generation is presented. This method has the advantages to create sufficient long secret keys with a high key agreement ratio between authorized users without revealing information to the attacker. The new scheme is experimentally validated using Ultra Wide Band technology.","doi":"10.1109/NTMS.2009.5384826","publicationTitle":"2009 3rd International Conference on New Technologies, Mobility and Security","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 3rd International Conference on New Technologies, Mobility and Security","pdfPath":"/iel5/5384533/5384652/05384826.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NTMS.2009.5384826","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5384652","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Adaptive Quantization Algorithm for Secret Key Generation Using Radio Channel Measurements","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5384826","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-23 Dec. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5384826/","displayDocTitle":"An Adaptive Quantization Algorithm for Secret Key Generation Using Radio Channel Measurements","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","accessionNumber":"11087568","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5384826/","conferenceDate":"20-23 Dec. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Adaptive Quantization Algorithm for Secret Key Generation Using Radio Channel Measurements","confLoc":"Cairo, Egypt","sourcePdf":"pid992584.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.08961S","chronDate":"20-23 Dec. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5384533","isNumber":"5384652","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5384533","citationCount":"30","xplore-issue":"5384652","articleId":"5384826","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5384930,"authors":[{"name":"Hassan Masood","affiliation":["National University of Science and Technology, Rawalpindi, Pakistan"],"firstName":"Hassan","lastName":"Masood","id":"37400385400"},{"name":"Mohammad Asim","affiliation":["National University of Science and Technology, Rawalpindi, Pakistan"],"firstName":"Mohammad","lastName":"Asim","id":"37063151800"},{"name":"Mustafa Mumtaz","affiliation":["National University of Science and Technology, Rawalpindi, Pakistan"],"firstName":"Mustafa","lastName":"Mumtaz","id":"37400384700"},{"name":"Atif Bin Mansoor","affiliation":["National University of Science and Technology, Rawalpindi, Pakistan"],"firstName":"Atif Bin","lastName":"Mansoor","id":"37288232500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5297-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-3866-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5384930","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":316},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Discrete wavelet transforms","Fourier transforms","Biometrics","Data mining","Gabor filters","Discrete Fourier transforms","Fingerprint recognition","Image texture analysis","Digital images","Computer applications"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biometrics (access control)","channel bank filters","image recognition","transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["nonsubsampled contourlet transforms","combined contourlet transforms","palmprint personal identification approach","biometric modality","user acceptance","distance transform","iterated directional filterbanks","directional energy components","GPDS hand database","equal error rate","feature level fusion","normalized Euclidean distance classifier"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Biometrics","Palmprint Identification","Texture Analysis","Directional Filterbanks","Contourlet Transform","Non subsampled Contourlet Transform"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5384930","abstract":"Palmprint based personal verification is an accepted biometric modality due to its reliability, ease of acquisition and user acceptance. This paper presents a novel palmprint based identification approach which draw on the textural information available on the palmprint by utilizing a combination of contourlet and non subsampled contourlet transforms. Center of the palm is computed using the distance transform whereas the parameters of best fitting ellipse help determine the alignment of the palmprint. ROI of 256\u00d7256 pixels is cropped around the center, and subsequently it is divided into fine slices, using iterated directional filterbanks. Next, directional energy components for each block of the decomposed subband outputs are computed using contourlet and non subsampled contourlet transforms. The proposed algorithm captures global details in a palmprint as compact fixed length palm codes for contourlet and NSCT respectively which are further concatenated at feature level for identification using normalized Euclidean distance classifier. The proposed algorithm is tested on a total of 500 palm images of GPDS hand database, acquired from University of Las Palmas de Gran Canaria. The experimental results were compiled for individual transforms as well as for their optimized combination at feature level.

Image alignment has many applications in fields as diverse as video surveillance, computer vision, medical imaging, and video coding. The estimation of an objects' motion is a key step in image alignment. In this paper, we will present a low-complexity algorithm for estimation of motion parameters. Most of the motion parameters estimation algorithms are carried out with a precision of 8 bits per pixel; here we propose an algorithm using only 1 bit per pixel resulting in lower complexity. The proposed method includes a technique for calculating the gradient of the sum-of-squared difference (SSD) using XOR operations instead of multiplication. Experimental results show that the proposed method compares favorably with registration using the full precision of the input images.","doi":"10.1109/DICTA.2009.11","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DICTA.2009.11","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Digital Image Computing: Techniques and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5384537/5384566/05384951.pdf","publicationTitle":"2009 Digital Image Computing: Techniques and Applications","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5384566","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Low Complexity Algorithm for Global Motion Parameter Estimation Targeting Hardware Implementation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"1-3 Dec. 2009","displayDocTitle":"A Low Complexity Algorithm for Global Motion Parameter Estimation Targeting Hardware Implementation","conferenceDate":"1-3 Dec. 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2010","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5384951/","accessionNumber":"11118908","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5384951/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Low Complexity Algorithm for Global Motion Parameter Estimation Targeting Hardware Implementation","confLoc":"Melbourne, VIC, Australia","sourcePdf":"3866a001.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.085577S","chronDate":"1-3 Dec. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5384537","isNumber":"5384566","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5384537","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5384566","articleId":"5384951","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-15"},{"_id":5384958,"authors":[{"name":"Masoud Mazloom","affiliation":["Department of Computer Engineering, Shahid Chamran University, Ahvaz, Iran"],"firstName":"Masoud","lastName":"Mazloom","id":"37658302100"},{"name":"Shohreh Kasaei","affiliation":["Department of Computer Engineering, Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Shohreh","lastName":"Kasaei","id":"37391480900"},{"name":"Nourolhoda Alemi Neissi","affiliation":["Department of Computer Engineering, Shariaty University of Tehran, Ahvaz, Iran"],"firstName":"Nourolhoda Alemi","lastName":"Neissi","id":"37671819300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5297-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-3866-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5384958","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":111},"abstract":"This work presents a method to increase the face recognition accuracy using a combination of wavelet, PCA, KPCA, and RBF neural networks. Preprocessing, feature extraction and classification rules are three crucial issues for face recognition. This paper presents a hybrid approach to employ these issues. For preprocessing and feature extraction steps, we apply a combination of wavelet transform, PCA and KPCA. During the classification stage, the neural network (RBF) is explored to achieve a robust decision in presence of wide facial variations. At first derives a feature vector from a set of downsampled wavelet representation of face images, then the resulting PCA-based linear features and KPCA- based nonlinear features on wavelet feature vector for reduces the dimensionary of the vector, are extracted. During the classification stage, the neural network (RBF) is explored to achieve a robust decision in presence of wide facial variations. The computational load of the proposed method is greatly reduced as comparing with the original PCA, KPCA, ICA and LDA based method on the ORL, Yale and AR face databases. Moreover, the accuracy of the proposed method is improved.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Digital Image Computing: Techniques and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5384537/5384566/05384958.pdf","startPage":"296","endPage":"302","publicationTitle":"2009 Digital Image Computing: Techniques and Applications","doi":"10.1109/DICTA.2009.56","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DICTA.2009.56","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5384566","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5384958","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Wavelet Transform and Fusion of Linear and Non Linear Method for Face Recognition","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wavelet transforms","Face recognition","Principal component analysis","Neural networks","Vectors","Feature extraction","Robustness","Independent component analysis","Linear discriminant analysis","Databases"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["face recognition","feature extraction","image classification","principal component analysis","radial basis function networks","wavelet transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wavelet transform","face recognition","nonlinear method","RBF neural networks","principal component analysis","feature extraction","classification rules","downsampled wavelet representation","PCA based linear features","KPCA based nonlinear features"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5384958/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-3 Dec. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Wavelet Transform and Fusion of Linear and Non Linear Method for Face Recognition","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5384958/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","accessionNumber":"11118912","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2010","conferenceDate":"1-3 Dec. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Wavelet Transform and Fusion of Linear and Non Linear Method for Face Recognition","confLoc":"Melbourne, VIC, Australia","sourcePdf":"3866a296.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070591S","chronDate":"1-3 Dec. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5384537","isNumber":"5384566","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5384537","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5384566","articleId":"5384958","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5384975,"authors":[{"name":"David Ryan","affiliation":["Image and Video Laboratory, Queensland University of Technology, Brisbane, Australia"],"firstName":"David","lastName":"Ryan","id":"37602628300"},{"name":"Simon Denman","affiliation":["Image and Video Laboratory, Queensland University of Technology, Brisbane, Australia"],"firstName":"Simon","lastName":"Denman","id":"37590961200"},{"name":"Clinton Fookes","affiliation":["Image and Video Laboratory, Queensland University of Technology, Brisbane, Australia"],"firstName":"Clinton","lastName":"Fookes","id":"37281919100"},{"name":"Sridha Sridharan","affiliation":["Image and Video Laboratory, Queensland University of Technology, Brisbane, Australia"],"firstName":"Sridha","lastName":"Sridharan","id":"37266096100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5297-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-3866-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5384975","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":145,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":1680},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Training data","Layout","Cameras","Testing","Spatial databases","Digital images","Computer applications","Laboratories","Australia","Safety"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cameras","feature extraction","image classification"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiple local features","holistic image features","crowd counting algorithm","foreground blob segment","group sizes","multi-camera environment","localised approach","ground truth annotation","pedestrian database","training set"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Crowd Counting","Crowd Density","Local Features","Foreground segmentation"]}],"abstract":"In public venues, crowd size is a key indicator of crowd safety and stability. Crowding levels can be detected using holistic image features, however this requires a large amount of training data to capture the wide variations in crowd distribution. If a crowd counting algorithm is to be deployed across a large number of cameras, such a large and burdensome training requirement is far from ideal. In this paper we propose an approach that uses local features to count the number of people in each foreground blob segment, so that the total crowd estimate is the sum of the group sizes. This results in an approach that is scalable to crowd volumes not seen in the training data, and can be trained on a very small data set. As a local approach is used, the proposed algorithm can easily be used to estimate crowd density throughout different regions of the scene and be used in a multi-camera environment. A unique localised approach to ground truth annotation reduces the required training data is also presented, as a localised approach to crowd counting has different training requirements to a holistic one. Testing on a large pedestrian database compares the proposed technique to existing holistic techniques and demonstrates improved accuracy, and superior performance when test conditions are unseen in the training set, or a minimal training set is used.","doi":"10.1109/DICTA.2009.22","publicationTitle":"2009 Digital Image Computing: Techniques and Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Digital Image Computing: Techniques and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5384537/5384566/05384975.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DICTA.2009.22","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5384566","startPage":"81","endPage":"88","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Crowd Counting Using Multiple Local Features","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5384975","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Crowd Counting Using Multiple Local Features","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-3 Dec. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5384975/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"1-3 Dec. 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","accessionNumber":"11118924","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5384975/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Crowd Counting Using Multiple Local Features","confLoc":"Melbourne, VIC, Australia","sourcePdf":"3866a081.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064129S","chronDate":"1-3 Dec. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5384537","isNumber":"5384566","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5384537","citationCount":"145","xplore-issue":"5384566","articleId":"5384975","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-19"},{"_id":5385016,"authors":[{"name":"Meng Xin","affiliation":["Hebei University of Engineering, Handan, China"],"firstName":"Meng","lastName":"Xin","id":"38113931900"},{"name":"Gao Junru","affiliation":["Hebei University of Engineering, Handan, China"],"firstName":"Gao","lastName":"Junru","id":"38099672600"},{"name":"Li Lei","affiliation":["Hebei University of Engineering, Handan, China"],"firstName":"Li","lastName":"Lei","id":"38102866100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5423-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5422-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3930-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5385016","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":250},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5385016","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Thermal loading","Power generation","Genetic algorithms","Power generation economics","Mathematical model","Fuel economy","MATLAB","Optimization methods","Application software","Thermal management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["coal","genetic algorithms","power generation dispatch","steam power stations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["thermal power plant load distribution","adaptive genetic algorithm","resource consumption","annual coal consumption","economic dispatch","MATLAB program","optimum program"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Load Distribution","Adaptive Genetic Algorithm","Power Plant","Coal Consumption Curve"]}],"doi":"10.1109/IFCSTA.2009.126","pdfPath":"/iel5/5384535/5384569/05385016.pdf","publicationTitle":"2009 International Forum on Computer Science-Technology and Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Forum on Computer Science-Technology and Applications","startPage":"15","endPage":"18","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5384569","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IFCSTA.2009.126","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Load Distribution of Thermal Power Plant Based on Adaptive Genetic Algorithm","abstract":"Power plant is a huge industry to consume the resources.

In this treatment, the multiple observation probability is expressed as a combination of individual observation probabilities without losing generality. This combinatorial method gives one more freedom in making different dependence-independence assumptions. By generalizing Baum's auxiliary function into this framework and building up an associated objective function using Lagrange multiplier method, several new formulae solving model training problem are theoretically derived.

A class-E amplifier is not an ideal current or voltage source as is required for the traditional analysis of the Chireix outphasing topology. It requires a phase modulated input signal and has a non-linear transfer characteristic which is a function of the load impedance. In this paper, we present a load pull analysis technique to characterize the efficiency performance of class-E amplifiers in a Chireix outphasing topology. An operating load locus based on the load pull analysis has been defined in the load pull plane of each amplifier. The defined load locus is used to find the nonlinear transfer function, efficiency, output power, input drive phase and losses associated with the Chireix outphasing topology. This analysis can also be used to characterize the Chireix outphasing performance of other amplifier classes.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5384114","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APMC.2009.5385209","publicationTitle":"2009 Asia Pacific Microwave Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Asia Pacific Microwave Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5374440/5384114/05385209.pdf","startPage":"2180","endPage":"2183","doi":"10.1109/APMC.2009.5385209","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Load pull analysis of Chireix outphasing class-E power amplifiers","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-10 Dec. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Load pull analysis of Chireix outphasing class-E power amplifiers","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"7-10 Dec. 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5385209/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","accessionNumber":"11087057","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2010","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5385209/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Load pull analysis of Chireix outphasing class-E power amplifiers","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"5581695.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069096S","chronDate":"7-10 Dec. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5374440","isNumber":"5384114","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5374440","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5384114","articleId":"5385209","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":5385211,"authors":[{"name":"Akram Alomainy","affiliation":["School of Electronic Engineering and Computer Science, Queen''s Mary, University of London, London, UK"],"firstName":"Akram","lastName":"Alomainy","id":"37298642100"},{"name":"Qammer H.

System-level modelling of potential UWB impulse radio is conducted and system performance is measured using bit error rate (BER) and signal-to-noise ratio parameters corresponding to modulation techniques such as pulse position modulation and bi-phase modulation.

The test board with implemented inverse Class F GaN HEMT power amplifier has been measured and high-performance results with drain efficiencies of about 80% and higher were achieved across the wide ranges of bias supply voltages and operating frequencies.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5385315/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-10 Dec. 2009","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"7-10 Dec. 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5385315/","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2010","publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","accessionNumber":"11087402","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"High-efficiency transmission-line GaN HEMT inverse class F power amplifier for active antenna arrays","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High-efficiency transmission-line GaN HEMT inverse class F power amplifier for active antenna arrays","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"0811023.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.038335S","chronDate":"7-10 Dec. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5374440","isNumber":"5384114","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5374440","citationCount":"25","xplore-issue":"5384114","articleId":"5385315","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":5385319,"authors":[{"name":"Martin Sch\u00fc\u00dfler","affiliation":["Microwave Engineering, TU Darmstadt, Darmstadt, Germany"],"firstName":"Martin","lastName":"Sch\u00fc\u00dfler","id":"37300081900"},{"name":"Christian Mandel","affiliation":["Microwave Engineering, TU Darmstadt, Darmstadt, Germany"],"firstName":"Christian","lastName":"Mandel","id":"37542199100"},{"name":"Matthias Maasch","affiliation":["Microwave Engineering, TU Darmstadt, Darmstadt, Germany"],"firstName":"Matthias","lastName":"Maasch","id":"37545941400"},{"name":"Andre Giere","affiliation":["Microwave Engineering, TU Darmstadt, Darmstadt, Germany"],"firstName":"Andre","lastName":"Giere","id":"37550458300"},{"name":"Rolf Jakoby","affiliation":["Microwave Engineering, TU Darmstadt, Darmstadt, Germany"],"firstName":"Rolf","lastName":"Jakoby","id":"37274282700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2801-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2802-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2165-4727"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2165-4743"}],"articleNumber":"5385319","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":14,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":934},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Phase modulation","Wireless sensor networks","Surface acoustic waves","Acoustic sensors","Acoustic waves","Microwave theory and techniques","RFID tags","Microwave circuits","Quadrature phase shift keying","Monitoring"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["quadrature phase shift keying","radiofrequency identification","surface acoustic waves"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["chipless microwave RFID tags","wireless sensor tags","surface acoustic wave","information coding","passive QPSK coding","wireless monitoring","analog phase modulation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["passive microwave RFID","passive QPSK","passive modulation","wireless sensors"]}],"abstract":"Inspired by state of the art surface acoustic wave (SAW) technique an approach for the realization of chipless microwave RFID tags based on electrical circuits is proposed.

The low-noise amplifier circuit operates across a band of 0.3 to 10 GHz with a gain of around 14 dB and the measured noise figure NF below 1.5 dB up to 8 GHz. Measured small-signal results show good stability and very good agreement with simulated values.

With the diode predistortion linearizer, the third-order intermodulation distortion ratio (IMD3) of the 1.9-GHz class-F GaN HEMT power amplifier was improved over power output from 0 to 18 dBm.

Convergence in solution is demonstrated for basis functions of orders up to p = 2, while the proposed technique can be extended to basis functions of arbitrary order.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"FEM modeling of axisymmetric cavities with divergence-free constraint equation and hierarchical basis functions","publicationTitle":"2009 Asia Pacific Microwave Conference","doi":"10.1109/APMC.2009.5385415","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Asia Pacific Microwave Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5374440/5384114/05385415.pdf","startPage":"100","endPage":"103","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APMC.2009.5385415","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5384114","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5385415","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5385415/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-10 Dec. 2009","displayDocTitle":"FEM modeling of axisymmetric cavities with divergence-free constraint equation and hierarchical basis functions","conferenceDate":"7-10 Dec. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5385415/","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2010","publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","accessionNumber":"11086880","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FEM modeling of axisymmetric cavities with divergence-free constraint equation and hierarchical basis functions","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"0261447.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049725S","chronDate":"7-10 Dec. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5374440","isNumber":"5384114","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5374440","xplore-issue":"5384114","articleId":"5385415","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5385416,"authors":[{"name":"Mohamed Yahia","affiliation":["Ecole Nationale \u010f Ing\u00e8nieurs de Gab\u00e8s, Gabes, Tunisia"],"firstName":"Mohamed","lastName":"Yahia","id":"37282319500"},{"name":"Jun W.

Regard the matrix converter as a buck type PWM rectifier in the input side, the transfer function of input current using LC input filter is deduced. The parameter selection approach for the capacitor and inductor is presented. It has been verified that when LC circuit is adopted in the input filter, the input current will oscillate near the LC resonant frequency in both steady state and start-up process for the very low damping factor, and then the input current waveforms will be distorted. An improved input filter topology to increase the damping factor is then presented, and the damping resistance parameter selection method of the input filter is presented based on frequency response approach. To avoid the current spike at the start-up process, a start-up circuit is then proposed. The improved input filter has been tested on a 5.5 kW matrix converter prototype and good performances are achieved.","doi":"10.1109/PEDS.2009.5385684","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PEDS.2009.5385684","startPage":"672","endPage":"677","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Power Electronics and Drive Systems (PEDS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5374437/5385648/05385684.pdf","publicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Power Electronics and Drive Systems (PEDS)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5385648","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Damped input filter design of matrix converter","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 Nov. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Damped input filter design of matrix converter","conferenceDate":"2-5 Nov. 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2010","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5385684/","accessionNumber":"11133524","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5385684/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Damped input filter design of matrix converter","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"187.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056695S","chronDate":"2-5 Nov. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5374437","isNumber":"5385648","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5374437","citationCount":"35","xplore-issue":"5385648","articleId":"5385684","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":5385749,"authors":[{"name":"Cheng-Tao Tsai","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Chin-Yi University of Technology, Taichung, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Cheng-Tao","lastName":"Tsai","id":"37277837100"},{"name":"Chih-Lung Shen","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, National Kaohsiung First University of Science and Technology, Kaohsiung, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chih-Lung","lastName":"Shen","id":"37274255700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4166-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4167-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2164-5256"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2164-5264"}],"articleNumber":"5385749","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":22,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":833},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Coupling circuits","Switches","Switching converters","Zero voltage switching","Stress","Recycling","Switching circuits","Switching loss","Prototypes","Buck converters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["active networks","hybrid electric vehicles","switching convertors","zero voltage switching"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["interleaved soft-switching coupled-buck converter","active-clamp circuits","active switches","high step-down voltage ratio","duty cycle","current stress","leakage energy","minimum ringing voltage","auxiliary switches","zero-voltage switching","switching loss","hybrid electric vehicle on-board chargers","ZVS","power 240 W"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Active-clamp","interleaved","coupled-buck converter","zero-voltage switching"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5385749","abstract":"This paper presents a coupled-buck converter with active-clamp circuits. The active switches in the converter can sustain a long enough duty cycle while it operates with a high step-down voltage ratio, reducing current stress significantly. In the converter, the active-clamp circuits provided can have benefits of recycling the leakage energy, while minimum ringing voltage is across the active switches. Moreover, since both main and auxiliary switches can be turned on with zero-voltage switching (ZVS), switching loss can be reduced and conversion efficiency therefore can be improved significantly.

However, for a conventional WBAN, the only way to communicate with the doctors' computers or hospital's servers is through the local gateway. Hence, the reliability of the WBAN is greatly dependent on the life span of the gateway. In this paper, a selective gateway method based on the residual energy of the sensor nodes has been proposed. By changing the gateway, the lifetime of the WBAN can be extended. To further increase the lifetime of the WBAN, a thermal energy harvesting system has been proposed to harvest heat energy from human warmth. Energy harvested using the thermoelectric generator (TEG) is stored in an energy storage device until sufficient energy is available. Based on the experimental test results obtained, the accumulated energy is around 1.369 mJ to power the loads comprising of sensor, RF transmitter and its associated electronic circuits. The sensed information is transmitted in 5 digital words of 12-bit data across a transmission period of 120 msec.

This transverse flux permanent magnet motor is designed to achieve high torque-to-weight ratio and is suitable for direct-drive wheel applications. As in conventional TFM, the phases are located under each other, which will increase the axial length of the machine. The idea of this design is to reduce the axial length of TFM, by placing the windings around the stator and by shifting those from each other by electrically 120\u00b0 or 90\u00b0, for three- or two-phase machine, respectively. Therefore, a remarkable reduction on the total axial length of the machine will be achieved while keeping the torque density high. This TFM is compared to another similar TFM, in which the three phases have been divided into two halves and placed opposite each other to ensure the mechanical balance and stability of the stator. The corresponding mechanical phase shifts between the phases have accordingly been taken into account. The motors are modelled in finite-element method (FEM) program, Flux3D, and designed to meet the specifications of an optimisation scheme, subject to certain constraints, such as construction dimensions, electric and magnetic loading. Based on this comparison study, many recommendations have been suggested to achieve optimum results.","doi":"10.1109/PEDS.2009.5385859","publicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Power Electronics and Drive Systems (PEDS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Power Electronics and Drive Systems (PEDS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5374437/5385648/05385859.pdf","startPage":"102","endPage":"108","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PEDS.2009.5385859","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5385648","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Transverse flux machines with distributed windings for in-wheel applications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5385859","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 Nov. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5385859/","displayDocTitle":"Transverse flux machines with distributed windings for in-wheel applications","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2009","accessionNumber":"11133627","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5385859/","conferenceDate":"2-5 Nov. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Transverse flux machines with distributed windings for in-wheel applications","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"512.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066956S","chronDate":"2-5 Nov. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5374437","isNumber":"5385648","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5374437","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"5385648","articleId":"5385859","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5385871,"authors":[{"name":"Hong Hee Lee","affiliation":["NARC, Ulsan University, Korea"],"firstName":"Hong Hee","lastName":"Lee","id":"37292584100"},{"name":"Phan Quoc Dzung","affiliation":["Faculty of Electrical & Electronic Engineering, HCMC University of Technology, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam"],"firstName":"Phan Quoc","lastName":"Dzung","id":"37596789700"},{"name":"Le Minh Phuong","affiliation":["Faculty of Electrical & Electronic Engineering, HCMC University of Technology, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam"],"firstName":"Le Minh","lastName":"Phuong","id":"37428153600"},{"name":"Le Dinh Khoa","affiliation":["Faculty of Electrical & Electronic Engineering, HCMC University of Technology, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam"],"firstName":"Le Dinh","lastName":"Khoa","id":"37546816400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4166-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4167-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2164-5256"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2164-5264"}],"articleNumber":"5385871","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":137},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Artificial neural networks","Matrix converters","Control systems","Optimal control","Voltage control","Cities and towns","Digital signal processing","Neural networks","Neurons","Flowcharts"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["matrix convertors","neurocontrollers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["artificial neural network controller","direct control method","matrix converters","DSP control system","ANN-DCM","individual training strategy","supervised models","computer simulation program","Matlab/Simulink","neural network toolbox"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5385871","abstract":"This work presents a new artificial neural network (ANN) Controller for implementing the Direct control method (DCM) for Matrix converters (MC) to decrease the time of calculation of the conventional DSP control system.

The tracking capability of the current controller dominates the performance of the APF. Since the required harmonic compensating currents are of periodic, the repetitive control may be considered as an effective means to achieve accurate current tracking. However, the use of low-pass or bandpass filter in the control loop may introduce phase lag and deteroriate the tracking performance. This paper presents a novel repetitive current control scheme, which utilizes a real-time delayless digital filter based on wavelet transform, to command the APF deliver desired compensating currents. The filtering capability of the wavelet transform is elaborated and its real-time version is also developed for incorporating with the repetitive control scheme. For maintaining a constant dc-capacitor voltage despite of inverter conduction loss, a simple proportional-integral algorithm is employed in the voltage loop. A 2-kVA DSP-based controlled prototype has been built to justify the enhanced tracking accuracy and robustness of the proposed wavelet-based repetitive controller.","doi":"10.1109/PEDS.2009.5385896","publicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Power Electronics and Drive Systems (PEDS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Power Electronics and Drive Systems (PEDS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5374437/5385648/05385896.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PEDS.2009.5385896","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5385648","startPage":"376","endPage":"380","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A repetitive control approach for three-phase shunt active power filters with real-time wavelet transform","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5385896","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A repetitive control approach for three-phase shunt active power filters with real-time wavelet transform","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 Nov. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5385896/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"2-5 Nov. 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2009","accessionNumber":"11133518","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5385896/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A repetitive control approach for three-phase shunt active power filters with real-time wavelet transform","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"570.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058367S","chronDate":"2-5 Nov. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5374437","isNumber":"5385648","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5374437","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"5385648","articleId":"5385896","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5385904,"authors":[{"name":"Zhe Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Technical University of Denmark, Kongens Lyngby, Denmark"],"firstName":"Zhe","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37598588200"},{"name":"Ole C.

The proposed method combines the use of genetic and fuzzy algorithms together to simplify the design method. Genetic algorithms (GA) are utilized for handling a multiple objective problem, whereas fuzzy algorithms (FA) simplify a definition of fitness evaluated functions for GA. Knowledge of design guidelines as well as specified dimensions is counted as the optimization objectives in the design process. Difficulty and complexity for describing an increased number of the fitness functions are declined by means of fuzzy description. Therefore, this method is much convenient to provide the means for multi-objective based optimization problems. An application is set to describe the functionalities of the proposed method. Simulation results verify that the improved GA with fuzzy algorithms gives better performances for the multi-objective optimization problems than those of conventional genetic algorithms.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 Nov. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5385926/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11133501","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5385926/","publicationDate":"Nov. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2010","conferenceDate":"2-5 Nov. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Multi-objective based optimization for switched reluctance machines using fuzzy and genetic algorithms","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multi-objective based optimization for switched reluctance machines using fuzzy and genetic algorithms","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"619.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045962S","chronDate":"2-5 Nov. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5374437","isNumber":"5385648","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5374437","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5385648","articleId":"5385926","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5385935,"authors":[{"name":"Moshe Tur","affiliation":["Tel-Aviv University, Tel-Aviv, Israel"],"firstName":"Moshe","lastName":"Tur","id":"37276678400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3985-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5385935","dbTime":"15 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1057},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5385935","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Delay effects","Array signal processing","Broadband antennas","Phased arrays","Radio frequency","Dynamic range","Antenna arrays","Phase shifters","Photonics","Optical losses"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna phased arrays","Bragg gratings","broadband antennas","optical signal detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["true time delay photonic beamforming","large phased array antennas","wideband array antennas","digital beamforming","electronic beamformers","dispersive components","switched fabrics","chirped Bragg gratings","wavelength division multiplexed approaches","stimulated Brillouin scattering"]}],"doi":"10.1109/COMCAS.2009.5385935","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Microwaves, Communications, Antennas and Electronics Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Microwaves, Communications, Antennas and Electronics Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5356753/5385934/05385935.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"2","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/COMCAS.2009.5385935","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5385934","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"True time delay photonic beamforming: A review","abstract":"[Summary form only given]. Wideband, large phased array antennas, using analog control for angle scanning, require true time delay (TTD), rather than phase shifters, to avoid squint and other impairments in both the temporal and spatial domains. While digital beamforming may eventually become a viable solution for such high-end systems, photonic technology can currently provide the required TTD capabilities. Common to most, if not all photonic solutions is the conversion of the RF signal to light, which after proper photonic processing is detected to produce a delayed RF replica of the input RF signal. This double conversion is quite lossy and often requires optical amplification to achieve the required dynamic range. Many architectures have been proposed for the implementation of TTDs. The talk will discuss some of these proposed architectures, including the use of dispersive components, switched fabrics, chirped Bragg gratings, wavelength division multiplexed approaches, as well as solutions based on nonlinear phenomena such as slow light and stimulated Brillouin scattering. In analyzing these various architectures, the following are among the important characteristics should be examined: (i) Flatness of their RF response; (ii) uniformity among the many TTDs populating the array; (iii) dynamic range; (iv) nonlinearities and their implications, as well as complexity, volume, weight and cost. In conclusion, it appears that when properly designed, photonic beamformers have matured to the point, where they can replace classical electronic beamformers, offering extremely wide bandwidth and large scanning angles.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"9-11 Nov. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5385935/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"11133213","publicationDate":"Nov. 2009","conferenceDate":"9-11 Nov. 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5385935/","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"True time delay photonic beamforming: A review","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"True time delay photonic beamforming: A review","confLoc":"Tel Aviv, Israel","sourcePdf":"294.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046511S","chronDate":"9-11 Nov. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5356753","isNumber":"5385934","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5356753","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"5385934","articleId":"5385935","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5385943,"authors":[{"name":"Jay A.

ultra-wide band (UWB) radio-over-fiber (RoF) systems to increase both the transmission distance and the high data bit rate. With a central station (CS) and a base station (BS), this architecture allows to send through an optical fiber both a subcarrier microwave signal and UWB baseband data by using a wavelength multiplexer. At the BS, the carrier frequency is photodetected, modulated by data and then up-converted to millimeter-wave band. Simulation results using VPIsystems software are reported and discussed for multi-band orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (MB-OFDM) signals.","doi":"10.1109/COMCAS.2009.5386001","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Microwaves, Communications, Antennas and Electronics Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Microwaves, Communications, Antennas and Electronics Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5356753/5385934/05386001.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/COMCAS.2009.5386001","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5385934","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A 60 GHz Radio-over-Fiber architecture for the transmission of UWB-OFDM signals","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5386001","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A 60 GHz Radio-over-Fiber architecture for the transmission of UWB-OFDM signals","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-11 Nov. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5386001/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"9-11 Nov. 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2009","accessionNumber":"11133231","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5386001/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A 60 GHz Radio-over-Fiber architecture for the transmission of UWB-OFDM signals","confLoc":"Tel Aviv, Israel","sourcePdf":"212.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044807S","chronDate":"9-11 Nov. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5356753","isNumber":"5385934","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5356753","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5385934","articleId":"5386001","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5386013,"authors":[{"name":"Nadav Snir","affiliation":["Elipse RFIC Array Devices"],"firstName":"Nadav","lastName":"Snir","id":"38344153600"},{"name":"Noam Bar-Helmer","affiliation":["Elipse RFIC Array Devices"],"firstName":"Noam","lastName":"Bar-Helmer","id":"38304748100"},{"name":"Roman Pasternak","affiliation":["Elipse RFIC Array Devices"],"firstName":"Roman","lastName":"Pasternak","id":"38302642200"},{"name":"Dror Regev","affiliation":["Elipse RFIC Array Devices"],"firstName":"Dror","lastName":"Regev","id":"38340530200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3985-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5386013","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":334},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Packaging","Low-noise amplifiers","Circuit noise","Circuit simulation","Performance loss","Frequency","Degradation","Inductance","Silicon germanium","Germanium silicon alloys"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["circuit layout","low noise amplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["packaged X-band low noise amplifier","LNA","electromagnetic simulations","circuit layout","package parasitic","temperature 293 K to 298 K","SiGe"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["low-noise amplifier (LNA)","X-band","radio frequency integrated circuit (RFIC)","integrated circuit bonding","noise figure (NF)","silicon germanium (SiGe)","heterojunction bipolar transistor (HBT)","QFN"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5386013","doi":"10.1109/COMCAS.2009.5386013","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/COMCAS.2009.5386013","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5385934","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Microwaves, Communications, Antennas and Electronics Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Microwaves, Communications, Antennas and Electronics Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5356753/5385934/05386013.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A packaged X-band low noise amplifier","abstract":"The design of commercially packaged LNA at X band frequencies necessitates the examination of different circuit aspects and poses some significant challenges.

In this work, commercial SiGe 0.18 technology was selected for its inherent high gain and low noise. RF grounding approach in this design achieved minimal parasitic effects.

This paper presents a methodology and framework to minimize system power consumption for multichannel communications using cognitive radio (CR) based on the application quality of service requirement, the channel condition, and the radio capabilities and characteristics. The CR framework enables an adaptation process that is aware of the radio (component) capabilities and characteristics. This paper mathematically formulates a system power consumption minimization problem under a rate constraint for multichannel communications and develops numerical solutions. Simulation results show that the knowledge of the radio capabilities and characteristics can help to reduce system power consumption significantly (e.g., up to 55% for a multichannel system with Class A power amplifiers).","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Microwaves, Communications, Antennas and Electronics Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5356753/5385934/05386063.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Conference on Microwaves, Communications, Antennas and Electronics Systems","doi":"10.1109/COMCAS.2009.5386063","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/COMCAS.2009.5386063","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5385934","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5386063","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"System power consumption minimization for multichannel communications using cognitive radio","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Energy consumption","Cognitive radio","Chromium","Quality of service","MIMO","Mobile communication","Power amplifiers","Helium","Power engineering computing","Power engineering and energy"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","power consumption","quality of service","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["system power consumption minimization","multichannel communications","cognitive radio","mobile devices","wireless devices","channel condition","radio capabilities","quality of service requirement","numerical solutions"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cognitive radio","multichannel communications","power amplifiers","power consumption"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5386063/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-11 Nov. 2009","displayDocTitle":"System power consumption minimization for multichannel communications using cognitive radio","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5386063/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2009","accessionNumber":"11118867","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2010","conferenceDate":"9-11 Nov. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"System power consumption minimization for multichannel communications using cognitive radio","confLoc":"Tel Aviv, Israel","sourcePdf":"137.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067977S","chronDate":"9-11 Nov. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5356753","isNumber":"5385934","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5356753","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"5385934","articleId":"5386063","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5386086,"authors":[{"name":"Y.

The application of HRV analysis in both research and clinical settings has seen rapid development in the past decades. Unlike previous research, this study employed features derived from longterm monitoring of HRV indices, as these trends can best reflect the autonomic nervous system dynamics influenced by various physiological conditions. We proposed two methods for mining physiological conditions from HRV trends: a decision-tree learning method and a hybrid learning method that combines feature selection, feature extraction, and classifier construction processes. The proposed methods have been validated through a clinical case study: severity classification for Parkinson's disease. Our approach yielded classification accuracy greater than 90.0%, and high sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive values (PPV), and negative predictive values (NPV).","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Heart rate variability","Hafnium","Biomedical monitoring","Parkinson's disease","Autonomic nervous system","Cardiology","Fatigue","Learning systems","Feature extraction","Collaboration"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cardiology","data mining","decision trees","feature extraction","learning (artificial intelligence)","neurophysiology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["physiological condition mining","heart rate variability analysis","HRV analysis","autonomic nervous system","decision-tree learning method","feature selection","feature extraction","classifier construction","Parkinson's disease"]}],"doi":"10.1109/MCI.2009.935309","publicationTitle":"IEEE Computational Intelligence Magazine","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Computational Intelligence Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel5/10207/5386087/05386095.pdf","startPage":"50","endPage":"58","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5386087","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MCI.2009.935309","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Mining Physiological Conditions from Heart Rate Variability Analysis","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5386095","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Mining Physiological Conditions from Heart Rate Variability Analysis","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5386095/","volume":"5","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Feb. 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5386095/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"11071235","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 January 2010","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Mining Physiological Conditions from Heart Rate Variability Analysis","sourcePdf":"05mci01-lin.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.140231S","chronDate":"Feb.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"10207","isNumber":"5386087","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10207","citationCount":"46","xplore-issue":"5386087","articleId":"5386095","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-20"},{"_id":5386101,"authors":[{"name":"Jerry M.

Many all solid-state generator topologies have been developed to replace them. Marx modulator utilizing IGBTs as main switches has many advantages, such as variable pulse length and PRF, snubberless operation, inherent redundancy. However, the relatively slow turn-on speed of IGBT influences the pulse rise time of the Marx modulator. In this paper, a newly developed all solid-state pulsed power generator is proposed. This generator consists of a Marx modulator based on IGBT half bridge modules and a magnetic pulse sharpening circuit, which is employed to compress the rising edge of the Marx output pulse. The pulse sharpening circuit is composed of two magnetic compression switches and one peaking capacitor. The experimental results demonstrated the effectiveness of pulse sharpening. The design of IGBT drive circuits and magnetic switches is introduced in detail in this paper.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Pulsed Power Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5372360/5386092/05386270.pdf","startPage":"1233","endPage":"1238","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Pulsed Power Conference","doi":"10.1109/PPC.2009.5386270","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PPC.2009.5386270","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5386092","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5386270","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"All solid-state pulsed power generator with semiconductor and magnetic compression switches","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Solid state circuits","Pulse compression methods","Power generation","Pulse generation","Magnetic semiconductors","Power semiconductor switches","Magnetic switching","Pulse modulation","Insulated gate bipolar transistors","Pulse circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power semiconductor switches","pulse generators","pulse shaping circuits","pulsed power supplies","pulsed power switches"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["solid-state pulsed power generator","magnetic compression switches","semiconductor compression switches","Marx modulator","IGBT switch","magnetic pulse sharpening circuit","peaking capacitor","IGBT drive circuits","pulsed power sources"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5386270/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 28 2009-July 2 2009","displayDocTitle":"All solid-state pulsed power generator with semiconductor and magnetic compression switches","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5386270/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"11133330","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2010","conferenceDate":"28 June-2 July 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"All solid-state pulsed power generator with semiconductor and magnetic compression switches","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"24604P23.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.093649S","chronDate":"June 28 2009-July 2 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5372360","isNumber":"5386092","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5372360","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"5386092","articleId":"5386270","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5386283,"authors":[{"name":"T.

Requirements of these applications are repetitive fast rise time pulsed power. Recently, semiconductor power device technology has improved the performance of fast high voltage switching and low switching loss. In particular, insulated gate bipolar transistor (IGBT) is highly efficient semiconductor switching device. However, the IGBT switch is still not sufficient to drive the pulse laser and the pulse ozonizer themselves. In practical systems, semiconductor switches are used with the assistance of magnetic switches. We have studied and developed high repetition rate small size pulsed power generator for generation of discharge plasma. This generator consists of an IGBT switch circuit, a step-up pulse transformer and magnetic pulse compression circuit (MPC). This generator is able to generate an output voltage of about 14 kV with voltage rise time of less than 100 ns. And repetition rate are up to 2000 pulses per second (pps). We did the operation test and generate the streamer discharge with 2000 pps.","doi":"10.1109/PPC.2009.5386283","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Pulsed Power Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Pulsed Power Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5372360/5386092/05386283.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PPC.2009.5386283","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5386092","startPage":"394","endPage":"398","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High repetition rate pulsed power generator using IGBTs and magnetic pulse compression circuit","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5386283","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"High repetition rate pulsed power generator using IGBTs and magnetic pulse compression circuit","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 28 2009-July 2 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5386283/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"28 June-2 July 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"11133336","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5386283/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High repetition rate pulsed power generator using IGBTs and magnetic pulse compression circuit","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"074O153.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044716S","chronDate":"June 28 2009-July 2 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5372360","isNumber":"5386092","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5372360","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"5386092","articleId":"5386283","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5386479,"authors":[{"name":"Yige Wang","affiliation":["Mitsubishi Electric Research Laboratories, Inc., Cambridge, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Yige","lastName":"Wang","id":"37293649200"},{"name":"Shantanu Rane","affiliation":["Mitsubishi Electric Research Laboratories, Inc., Cambridge, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Shantanu","lastName":"Rane","id":"37283330300"},{"name":"Anthony Vetro","affiliation":["Mitsubishi Electric Research Laboratories, Inc., Cambridge, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Anthony","lastName":"Vetro","id":"37274798600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5279-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5280-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2157-4766"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2157-4774"}],"articleNumber":"5386479","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":182},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5386479","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Biometrics","Error correction codes","Robustness","Authentication","Access control","Error correction","Probes","Security","Feature extraction","Decoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biometrics (access control)","error correction codes","feature extraction","fuzzy set theory","message authentication","reliability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["leveraging reliable bits","practical secure biometric system","ECC design consideration","error correcting code","biometric signal","access control device","biometric fuzzy vaults","feature extraction algorithm","reliability"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Biometrics","fuzzy vault","distributed source coding","LDPC codes","error correction coding"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5386439","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 First IEEE International Workshop on Information Forensics and Security (WIFS)","publicationTitle":"2009 First IEEE International Workshop on Information Forensics and Security (WIFS)","doi":"10.1109/WIFS.2009.5386479","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Leveraging reliable bits: ECC design considerations for practical secure biometric systems","startPage":"71","endPage":"75","pdfPath":"/iel5/5377995/5386439/05386479.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WIFS.2009.5386479","abstract":"It is well-known that a biometric fuzzy vault can be constructed by applying an error correcting code (ECC) to a biometric signal. This is attractive because authentication only requires the check bits of the ECC to be stored on the access control device, whereas the personal biometric traits need not be stored. For a given coding rate, the ECC attempts to correct the errors between an enrollment biometric and the provided probe, and authenticates if it is successful in doing so. Unfortunately, most implementations of biometric fuzzy vaults have very poor robustness to the inherent noisiness of biometric measurements. In this paper, we provide ECC design considerations for secure biometric systems, which provide both better robustness and greater security. In particular, for any feature extraction algorithm, we propose to reorder the feature bits according to their reliability, and associate the reliable bits with high-degree variable nodes in the graph of the ECC. Further, the reliability of a bit is measured at enrollment and used to initialize the ECC decoding. Experiments on an extensive database show considerable reduction in the false reject rate, while restricting the successful attack rate to a very low value.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5386479/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-9 Dec. 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"6-9 Dec. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5386479/","accessionNumber":"11133690","displayDocTitle":"Leveraging reliable bits: ECC design considerations for practical secure biometric systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Leveraging reliable bits: ECC design considerations for practical secure biometric systems","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"0043.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050931S","chronDate":"6-9 Dec. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5377995","isNumber":"5386439","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5377995","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5386439","articleId":"5386479","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5386489,"authors":[{"name":"Matthias Kirchner","affiliation":["Faculty of Computer Science Institute of Systems Architecture, Technische Universit\u00e4t Dresden, Dresden, Germany"],"firstName":"Matthias","lastName":"Kirchner","id":"38196878400"},{"name":"Thomas Gloe","affiliation":["Faculty of Computer Science Institute of Systems Architecture, Technische Universit\u00e4t Dresden, Dresden, Germany"],"firstName":"Thomas","lastName":"Gloe","id":"37891225300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5279-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5280-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2157-4766"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2157-4774"}],"articleNumber":"5386489","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":44,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":635},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Transform coding","Image coding","Forensics","Digital images","Detectors","Interpolation","Image storage","Computer science","Computer architecture","Security"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data compression","image coding","object detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["resampling detection","re-compressed JPEG images","digital image forensics","JPEG compressed images","detection variant","JPEG pre-compression artifacts"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["digital image forensics","tamper detection","resampling detection","re-compression artifacts"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5386489","doi":"10.1109/WIFS.2009.5386489","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WIFS.2009.5386489","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5386439","publicationTitle":"2009 First IEEE International Workshop on Information Forensics and Security (WIFS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 First IEEE International Workshop on Information Forensics and Security (WIFS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5377995/5386439/05386489.pdf","startPage":"21","endPage":"25","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On resampling detection in re-compressed images","abstract":"Resampling detection has become a standard tool in digital image forensics.

In this paper we present the latest updates to this method and share some of the lessons learned. The SOMA method incorporates the key aspects of overall SOA solution design and delivery and is integrated with existing software development methods through a set of placeholders for key activity areas, forming what we call solution templates. We also present a fractal model of software development that can enable the SOMA method to evolve in an approach that goes beyond the iterative and incremental and instead leverages method components and patterns in a recursive, self-similar manner opportunistically at points of variability in the life cycle.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IBM","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5386496/","volume":"47","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"2008","dateOfInsertion":"06 April 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"SOMA: A method for developing service-oriented solutions","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"SOMA: A method for developing service-oriented solutions","sourcePdf":"arsanjani.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.030729S","chronDate":"2008","isNumber":"5386495","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5288519","citationCount":"94","articleId":"5386496","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IBM","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5386507,"authors":[{"name":"D.

Specifically, one should be able to demonstrate that projected customer requirements are met, to identify availability bottlenecks, to evaluate and compare different configurations, and to evaluate and compare different designs. For evaluation approaches based on analytic modeling, these systems are often sufficiently complex so that state-space methodsare not effective due to the large number of states, whereas combinatorial methods are inadequate for capturing all significant dependencies. The two-level hierarchical decomposition proposed here is suitable for the availability modeling of blade server systems such as IBM BladeCenter\u00ae, a commercial, high-availability multicomponent system comprising up to 14 separate blade servers and contained within a chassis that provides shared subsystems such as power and cooling. This approach is based on an availability model that combines a high-level fault tree model with a number of lowerlevel Markov models. It is used to determine component level contributions to downtime as well as steady-state availability for both standalone and clustered blade servers. Sensitivity of the results to input parameters is examined, extensions to the models are described, and availability bottlenecks and possible solutions are identified.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Availability analysis of blade server systems","publicationTitle":"IBM Systems Journal","doi":"10.1147/SJ.2008.5386524","displayPublicationTitle":"IBM Systems Journal","pdfPath":"/iel5/5288519/5386506/05386524.pdf","startPage":"621","endPage":"640","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1147/SJ.2008.5386524","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5386506","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5386524","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IBM","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5386524/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"2008","displayDocTitle":"Availability analysis of blade server systems","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"47","issue":"4","dateOfInsertion":"06 April 2010","publicationDate":"2008","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Availability analysis of blade server systems","sourcePdf":"smith.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.0338S","chronDate":"2008","isNumber":"5386506","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5288519","citationCount":"31","articleId":"5386524","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IBM","lastupdate":"2021-10-28"},{"_id":5386528,"authors":[{"name":"R.

The paper then discusses what transformative role information and communication technology (ICT) plays in coordinating and delivering value and managing this complexity. A conceptual model is developed for understanding and investigating the nature, delivery, and exchange of service value and assessing the complexity of a service value network. Three central arguments are presented. First, value in the services economy is driven and determined by the end consumer and delivered through a complex web of direct and indirect relationships between value network actors. Second, the complexity of service value networks not only depends on the number of actors but also on the conditional probabilities that these actors are involved in delivering the service to the consumer. Third, ICT plays a central role in reducing complexity for consumers by providing greater levels of value network integration, information visibility, and means to manage and anticipate change.","doi":"10.1147/sj.471.0053","publicationTitle":"IBM Systems Journal","displayPublicationTitle":"IBM Systems Journal","pdfPath":"/iel5/5288519/5386526/05386528.pdf","startPage":"53","endPage":"70","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1147/sj.471.0053","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5386526","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Complexity of service value networks: Conceptualization and empirical investigation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IBM","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5386528/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"2008","displayDocTitle":"Complexity of service value networks: Conceptualization and empirical investigation","volume":"47","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"2008","dateOfInsertion":"06 April 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Complexity of service value networks: Conceptualization and empirical investigation","sourcePdf":"basole.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.048296S","chronDate":"2008","isNumber":"5386526","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5288519","citationCount":"47","articleId":"5386528","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IBM","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5386538,"authors":[{"name":"I.

In this paper, we use input/output and other data to depict how service industries vary in such areas as products, markets, work organization, and technological characteristics\u2014most being very distinctive from primary industries (i.e., extractive industries such as agriculture, fisheries, forestry, mining, petroleum, quarrying, and the like) and secondary industries (i.e., manufacturing, construction, and utilities). Innovation survey data indicates that some service organizations behave very much like high-technology manufacturing. This is especially true of technology-based, knowledge-intensive business services (T-KIBS). Distinctive innovation patterns are displayed by KIBS based more on professional knowledge and by large network-based service firms, while many smaller service firms conform to a supplier-driven pattern. Only a small segment of service innovation conforms to the typical manufacturing-based model, in which innovation is largely organized and led by formal research and development (R&D) departments and production engineering. Project management and on-the-job innovation are common ways of organizing service innovation. Innovation policy and management have to be much more than R&D policy and R&D management: This is recognized by some national governments and in some business schools, but the full implications of a service-dominant logic are still rarely found.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5386526","publicationTitle":"IBM Systems Journal","displayPublicationTitle":"IBM Systems Journal","pdfPath":"/iel5/5288519/5386526/05386538.pdf","doi":"10.1147/sj.471.0115","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1147/sj.471.0115","startPage":"115","endPage":"128","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Patterns of innovation in service industries","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IBM","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5386538/","displayDocTitle":"Patterns of innovation in service industries","isJournal":true,"volume":"47","issue":"1","dateOfInsertion":"06 April 2010","publicationDate":"2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Patterns of innovation in service industries","sourcePdf":"miles.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.025838S","chronDate":"2008","isNumber":"5386526","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5288519","citationCount":"16","articleId":"5386538","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IBM","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5386541,"authors":[{"name":"C.

This assumption is true only if the service provider has monolithic control over the scope and architecture of the customer environment. The trend, however, is toward selective outsourcing, customer control over the architecture of IT solutions, and retention of legacy tools. Target environments are extremely heterogeneous, and the ability of the service provider to control them is diminishing. Consequently, there is a need for a new approach to IT service workflow automation and a new generation of service-delivery management systems that support heterogeneity and collaboration. This paper introduces a new approach to automating complex and variable workflows, applies this approach to IT service delivery management (SDM), presents an SDM architecture based on this approach, and discusses an SDM implementation driven by this architecture. Our implementation architecture leverages service-oriented architecture (SOA) principles by defining loosely coupled service components and a service fulfillment pattern that dynamically integrates them. We discuss the modeling of performance metrics for service delivery and describe how the monitoring and management of key performance indicators (KPIs) are supported as an integral part of our SDM platform.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IBM","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5386568/","volume":"46","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"2007","dateOfInsertion":"06 April 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Using a model-driven transformational approach and service-oriented architecture for service delivery management","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Using a model-driven transformational approach and service-oriented architecture for service delivery management","sourcePdf":"kumaran.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.030986S","chronDate":"2007","isNumber":"5386558","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5288519","citationCount":"6","articleId":"5386568","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IBM","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5386570,"authors":[{"name":"H.

Service-delivery teams fulfill service requests according to account-specific processes by using an account-specific service-request-management environment, making it difficult to leverage the skills of the various delivery teams for multiple accounts. The service delivery management platform (SDMP) uses reusable service components that can be performed by multiple delivery teams and can be assembled into service compositions to which multiple clients can subscribe. The SDMP catalog is the information repository that manages service components, composition, providers, and subscriptions and is used by the service-request runtime environment to implement specific customer service requests.

This ability is critical for reusing data consistently throughout the enterprise and deriving actionable knowledge from it. Accurate and high-quality data must consistently propagate meaning and value throughout the enterprise and comply with the policies and processes of the enterprise. For a variety of reasons, large enterprises manage data at a local level (e.g., for each department and location), resulting in information \u201csilos\u201d where data is redundantly stored, managed, and processed, each with its own policies and processes, leading to inconsistency. IBM has begun a transformation process to establish a program for the management of its critical data, beginning with the creation of an enterprise data strategy that is aligned with IBM business strategy. In this paper, we describe the progress, to date, of the IBM transformation process. We focus on the activities of the IBM Enterprise Business Information Center of Excellence (EBI CoE), which is responsible for establishing, implementing, and deploying the enterprise data architecture program. The EBI CoE uses leading-edge information management technology and services from IBM and its partners to address enterprise data challenges. We present lessons learned and best practices derived from this ongoing internal transformation process that can be useful for enterprises facing similar data challenges as they transform their operations and business models.","doi":"10.1147/sj.464.0669","publicationTitle":"IBM Systems Journal","displayPublicationTitle":"IBM Systems Journal","pdfPath":"/iel5/5288519/5386576/05386588.pdf","startPage":"669","endPage":"683","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1147/sj.464.0669","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5386576","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The internal information transformation of IBM","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IBM","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5386588/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"2007","displayDocTitle":"The internal information transformation of IBM","volume":"46","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"2007","dateOfInsertion":"06 April 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The internal information transformation of IBM","sourcePdf":"vayghan.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.044344S","chronDate":"2007","isNumber":"5386576","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5288519","citationCount":"2","articleId":"5386588","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IBM","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5386607,"authors":[{"name":"C.

Similarly, security violations pertaining to information flow consist of integrity violations and confidentiality violations, and consequently, our discussion of static analysis techniques for information-flow vulnerabilities includes these two topics.

However, developing such applications using traditional methods is challenging because of the intrinsic complexity of integrating large-scale business processes and existing applications. Model Driven Development\u2122 (MDD\u2122) is an approach to developing applications\u2014from domain-specific models to platform-sensitive models\u2014that bridges the gap between business processes and information technology. We describe the MDD framework and methodology used to create the IBM Business Performance Management (BPM) solution. We describe how we apply model-driven techniques to BPM and present a scenario from a pilot project in which these techniques were applied. Technical details on models and transformation are presented. Our framework uses and extends the IBM business observation metamodel and introduces a data warehouse metamodel and other platform-specific and transformational models. We discuss our lessons learned and present the general guidelines for using MDD to develop enterprise-scale applications.","doi":"10.1147/sj.453.0587","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1147/sj.453.0587","startPage":"587","endPage":"605","displayPublicationTitle":"IBM Systems Journal","pdfPath":"/iel5/5288519/5386619/05386626.pdf","publicationTitle":"IBM Systems Journal","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5386619","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Model Driven Development for Business Performance Management","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IBM","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"2006","chronOrPublicationDate":"2006","displayDocTitle":"Model Driven Development for Business Performance Management","publicationDate":"2006","dateOfInsertion":"06 April 2010","volume":"45","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5386626/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Model Driven Development for Business Performance Management","sourcePdf":"chowdhary.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.073579S","chronDate":"2006","isNumber":"5386619","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5288519","citationCount":"14","articleId":"5386626","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IBM","lastupdate":"2022-01-10"},{"_id":5386627,"authors":[{"name":"K.

As this issue of the IBM Systems Journal illustrates, there are exciting improvements in the technologies of model-driven development (MDD) to meet many of these challenges. Even though the prevalent software-development practices in the industry are still immature, tools that embody MDD technologies are finally being incorporated in large-scale commercial software development. Assuming MDD pervades the industry over the next several years, there is reason to hope for significant improvements in software quality and time to value, but it is far from a foregone conclusion that MDD will succeed where previous software-engineering approaches have failed.","doi":"10.1147/sj.453.0451","publicationTitle":"IBM Systems Journal","displayPublicationTitle":"IBM Systems Journal","pdfPath":"/iel5/5288519/5386619/05386628.pdf","startPage":"451","endPage":"461","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5386619","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1147/sj.453.0451","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Model-driven development: The good, the bad, and the ugly","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5386628","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IBM","displayDocTitle":"Model-driven development: The good, the bad, and the ugly","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5386628/","volume":"45","issue":"3","publicationDate":"2006","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 April 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"2006","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"2006","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Model-driven development: The good, the bad, and the ugly","sourcePdf":"hailpern.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.028214S","chronDate":"2006","isNumber":"5386619","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5288519","citationCount":"54","articleId":"5386628","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IBM","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":5386648,"authors":[{"name":"Fernanda B.

Each SPE has a high-speed local store attached to the main memory through direct memory access (DMA), but a drawback of this design is that the local store is not large enough for the entire application code or data. It must be decomposed into pieces small enough to fit into local memory, and they must be replaced through the DMA without losing the performance gain of multiple SPEs. We propose a new programming model, MPI microtask, based on the standard Message Passing Interface (MPI) programming model for distributed-memory parallel machines. In our new model, programmers do not need to manage the local store as long as they partition their application into a collection of small microtasks that fit into the local store. Furthermore, the preprocessor and runtime in our microtask system optimize the execution of microtasks by exploiting explicit communications in the MPI model. We have created a prototype that includes a novel static scheduler for such optimizations. Our initial experiments have shown some encouraging results.","doi":"10.1147/sj.451.0085","publicationTitle":"IBM Systems Journal","displayPublicationTitle":"IBM Systems Journal","pdfPath":"/iel5/5288519/5386649/05386656.pdf","startPage":"85","endPage":"102","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1147/sj.451.0085","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5386649","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"MPI microtask for programming the Cell Broadband Engine\u2122 processor","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IBM","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"2006","displayDocTitle":"MPI microtask for programming the Cell Broadband Engine\u2122 processor","volume":"45","issue":"1","dateOfInsertion":"06 April 2010","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5386656/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"2006","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"MPI microtask for programming the Cell Broadband Engine\u2122 processor","sourcePdf":"ohara.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.020517S","chronDate":"2006","isNumber":"5386649","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5288519","citationCount":"24","articleId":"5386656","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IBM","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":5386690,"authors":[{"name":"H.

This includes individuals who are blind, partially sighted, deaf, hard of hearing, or dyslexic. The varying requirements of print-disabled users have led us to the notion of enriched media documents that contain redundant alternative representations of the same information. Unlike existing one-document-for-all approaches, we propose a personalization process that customizes these rich media documents to the needs of an individual reader. This paper describes, from an iterative user-centered design perspective, the development of a multimedia reading system for a variety of print-disabled user groups. We address issues of establishing user personalization profiles, as well as adapting and customizing content, interaction, and navigation. Customization of interaction and navigation leads to differences in the user interface, as well as different structural views of indexes. Customization of content includes insertion of a summary, synchronization of sign language video with highlighting of text, self-voicing capability, alternative support for screen readers, or reorganization of layout to accommodate large fonts. Finally, we consider whether this approach of addressing the specific needs of heterogeneous user groups provides a basis for a universal design approach for multimedia user interfaces.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5386677","publicationTitle":"IBM Systems Journal","displayPublicationTitle":"IBM Systems Journal","pdfPath":"/iel5/5288519/5386677/05386690.pdf","doi":"10.1147/sj.443.0629","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1147/sj.443.0629","startPage":"629","endPage":"635","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Personalization, interaction, and navigation in rich multimedia documents for print-disabled users","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IBM","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"2005","chronOrPublicationDate":"2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5386690/","displayDocTitle":"Personalization, interaction, and navigation in rich multimedia documents for print-disabled users","isJournal":true,"volume":"44","issue":"3","dateOfInsertion":"06 April 2010","publicationDate":"2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Personalization, interaction, and navigation in rich multimedia documents for print-disabled users","sourcePdf":"petrie.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.035997S","chronDate":"2005","isNumber":"5386677","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5288519","citationCount":"2","articleId":"5386690","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IBM","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5386722,"authors":[{"name":"B.

This paper surveys the arguments presented by proponents of each type of software in published reports and discusses the deployment and reliability figures for both FOSS and proprietary systems as well.","doi":"10.1147/sj.442.0239","publicationTitle":"IBM Systems Journal","displayPublicationTitle":"IBM Systems Journal","pdfPath":"/iel5/5288519/5386721/05386727.pdf","startPage":"239","endPage":"248","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1147/sj.442.0239","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5386721","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Open-source versus proprietary software: Is one more reliable and secure than the other?","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IBM","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5386727/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"2005","chronOrPublicationDate":"2005","displayDocTitle":"Open-source versus proprietary software: Is one more reliable and secure than the other?","volume":"44","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"2005","dateOfInsertion":"06 April 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Open-source versus proprietary software: Is one more reliable and secure than the other?","sourcePdf":"boulanger.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.035253S","chronDate":"2005","isNumber":"5386721","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5288519","citationCount":"9","articleId":"5386727","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IBM","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5386739,"authors":[{"name":"T.

The use of BML allows testing and validation of the POWER5-based system to be conducted in parallel with the standard path, which involves the bring up of a hypervisor, the partition firmware, and the operating system. BML, which has fast boot times and can be modified quickly, is used in fault detection during chip manufacturing, POWER5 chip verification, system-board verification, and benchmarking for performance.

It needs to record details of what it produces in terms of concrete information. Business artifacts are a mechanism to record this information in units that are concrete, identifiable, self-describing, and indivisible. We developed the concept of artifacts, or semantic objects, in the context of a technique for constructing formal yet intuitive operational descriptions of a business. This technique, called OpS (Operational Specification), was developed over the course of many business-transformation and business-process-integration engagements for use in IBM's internal processes as well as for use with customers. Business artifacts (or business records) are the basis for the factorization of knowledge that enables the OpS technique. In this paper we present a comprehensive discussion of business artifacts\u2014what they are, how they are represented, and the role they play in operational business modeling. Unlike the more familiar and popular concept of business objects, business artifacts are pure instances rather than instances of a taxonomy of types. Consequently, the key operation on business artifacts is recognition rather than classification.","doi":"10.1147/sj.423.0428","publicationTitle":"IBM Systems Journal","displayPublicationTitle":"IBM Systems Journal","pdfPath":"/iel5/5288519/5386797/05386806.pdf","startPage":"428","endPage":"445","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1147/sj.423.0428","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5386797","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Business artifacts: An approach to operational specification","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IBM","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5386806/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"2003","chronOrPublicationDate":"2003","displayDocTitle":"Business artifacts: An approach to operational specification","volume":"42","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"2003","dateOfInsertion":"06 April 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Business artifacts: An approach to operational specification","sourcePdf":"nigam.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.026336S","chronDate":"2003","isNumber":"5386797","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5288519","citationCount":"80","articleId":"5386806","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2003","subType":"IBM","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5386823,"authors":[{"name":"R.

A general method, called Clockwork, for constructing predictive autonomic systems is proposed. The method is based on statistical modeling, tracking, and forecasting techniques borrowed from econometrics. Systems employing the method detect and subsequently forecast cyclic variations in load, estimate the impact on future performance, and use these data to self-tune, dynamically, in anticipation of need.

Such services are specified by service level agreements (SLAs) in which revenue accrues with the number of completed transactions, and costs are incurred if response times go above a specified threshold. In this paper we propose a profit-oriented feedback control system that automates the admission control decisions in a way that balances the loss of revenue due to rejected work against the penalties incurred if admitted work has excessive response times. One approach to making these trade-offs is to employ classical control theory (e.g., proportional integral controllers); however, doing so requires a labor-intensive design process that tailors the controller to a specific workload and profit model. Instead, we develop a fuzzy control algorithm that implements hill climbing logic to maximize profits and handle the stochastics that make profits quite \u201cbumpy.\u201d Our studies of a Lotus Notes\u00ae e-mail server reveal that the fuzzy controller requires little human intervention and is robust to changes in workloads and values of SLA parameters. Further, we prove that our design of the fuzzy controller leads to a value of the admission control parameter that maximizes steady state profits.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IBM","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"2002","chronOrPublicationDate":"2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5386869/","volume":"41","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"2002","dateOfInsertion":"06 April 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Using fuzzy control to maximize profits in service level management","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Using fuzzy control to maximize profits in service level management","sourcePdf":"diao.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.029909S","chronDate":"2002","isNumber":"5386863","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5288519","citationCount":"23","articleId":"5386869","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IBM","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5386905,"authors":[{"name":"E.

In our experiments, we use a model-based test generator to create a test suite for parts of the POSIX\u2122 standard and another test suite for the specification of Java\u2122 exception handling. We demonstrate that models derived from specifications produce better test suites than the suites specified by standards. In particular, our test suites achieved higher levels of code coverage with complete test requirements coverage. Moreover, the test suite for the Java study found code defects that were not exposed by other benchmark test suites. The effort involved in producing these models and test suites was comparable to the effort involved in developing a test suite by more conventional methods. We avoid the state space explosion problem by modeling only the external behavior of a specific feature of the standard, without modeling the details of any particular implementation.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IBM","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"2002","chronOrPublicationDate":"2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5386905/","volume":"41","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"2002","dateOfInsertion":"06 April 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Using a model-based test generator to test for standard conformance","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Using a model-based test generator to test for standard conformance","sourcePdf":"farchi.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.046111S","chronDate":"2002","isNumber":"5386899","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5288519","citationCount":"17","articleId":"5386905","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IBM","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5386913,"authors":[{"name":"M.

In this paper we survey ongoing work in flexible pricing in the context of the supply chain, including revenue management, procurement, and supply-chain coordination. We review negotiation mechanisms for procurement, including optimization approaches to the evaluation of complex, multidimensional bids. We also discuss several applications of flexible pricing on the sell side, including pricing strategies for response to requests for quotes, dynamic pricing in a reverse logistics application, and pricing in the emerging area of hosted applications services. We conclude with a discu ssion of future research directions in this rapidly growing area.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5386912","publicationTitle":"IBM Systems Journal","displayPublicationTitle":"IBM Systems Journal","pdfPath":"/iel5/5288519/5386912/05386913.pdf","doi":"10.1147/sj.412.0287","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1147/sj.412.0287","startPage":"287","endPage":"302","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Applications of flexible pricing in business-to-business electronic commerce","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IBM","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"2002","chronOrPublicationDate":"2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5386913/","displayDocTitle":"Applications of flexible pricing in business-to-business electronic commerce","isJournal":true,"volume":"41","issue":"2","dateOfInsertion":"06 April 2010","publicationDate":"2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Applications of flexible pricing in business-to-business electronic commerce","sourcePdf":"bichler.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.038659S","chronDate":"2002","isNumber":"5386912","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5288519","citationCount":"12","articleId":"5386913","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IBM","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5386933,"authors":[{"name":"C.

Governments, companies, and private citizens around the world are anxious to be a part of this revolution, but they are afraid that some hacker will break into their Web server and replace their logo with pornography, read their e-mail, steal their credit card number from an on-line shopping site, or implant software that will secretly transmit their organization's secrets to the open Internet.

Although many authors assert that communities of practice create organizational value, there has been relatively little systematic study of the linkage between community outcomes and the underlying social mechanisms that are at work. To build an understanding of how communities of practice create organizational value, we suggest thinking of a community as an engine for the development of social capital. We argue that the social capital resident in communities of practice leads to behavioral changes, which in turn positively influence business performance. We identify four specific performance outcomes associated with the communities of practice we studied and link these outcomes to the basic dimensions of social capital. These dimensions include connections among practitioners who may or may not be co-located, relationships that build a sense of trust and mutual obligation, and a common language and context that can be shared by community members. Our conclusions are based on a study of seven organizations where communities of practice are acknowledged to be creating value.","doi":"10.1147/sj.404.0831","publicationTitle":"IBM Systems Journal","displayPublicationTitle":"IBM Systems Journal","pdfPath":"/iel5/5288519/5386939/05386944.pdf","startPage":"831","endPage":"841","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1147/sj.404.0831","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5386939","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Communities of practice and organizational performance","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IBM","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5386944/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"2001","chronOrPublicationDate":"2001","displayDocTitle":"Communities of practice and organizational performance","volume":"40","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"2001","dateOfInsertion":"06 April 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Communities of practice and organizational performance","sourcePdf":"lesser.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.015247S","chronDate":"2001","isNumber":"5386939","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5288519","citationCount":"36","articleId":"5386944","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2001","subType":"IBM","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5386946,"authors":[{"name":"A.

Dynamic markets for both end products and technologies, coupled with the increasing costs of doing business, have resulted in a significant increase in the use of alliances. Yet, managers are finding it increasingly difficult to capture value from alliances. In this paper, we present a model that describes the knowledge resource exchange between alliance partners. This model focuses on the different dimensions of knowledge resources (tacitness, specificity, and complexity) and their associated value implications, as well as the different roles of the partner based on its position within an industry network (complementor, competitor, supplier, customer, or other). We also argue that in order to capture and internalize knowledge obtained through an alliance, a firm must have an alliance learning capability. We illustrate the use of this model in the computer industry by analyzing the publicly announced alliances of Dell Computer Corporation and Sun Microsystems, Inc. By applying our resource exchange model, we were able to analyze the alliance strategy for each firm and to understand the alignment between the announced business strategy and alliance strategy for each firm. The findings suggest that what is important is not necessarily a particular alliance strategy, but rather an alignment between alliance strategy and business strategy.","doi":"10.1147/sj.404.0908","publicationTitle":"IBM Systems Journal","displayPublicationTitle":"IBM Systems Journal","pdfPath":"/iel5/5288519/5386939/05386948.pdf","startPage":"908","endPage":"924","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1147/sj.404.0908","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5386939","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Knowledge resource exchange in strategic alliances","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IBM","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5386948/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"2001","chronOrPublicationDate":"2001","displayDocTitle":"Knowledge resource exchange in strategic alliances","volume":"40","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"2001","dateOfInsertion":"06 April 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Knowledge resource exchange in strategic alliances","sourcePdf":"parise.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.027919S","chronDate":"2001","isNumber":"5386939","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5288519","citationCount":"7","articleId":"5386948","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2001","subType":"IBM","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5386953,"authors":[{"name":"J.

The project has two main goals: to advance our understanding of the mechanisms behind protein folding via large-scale simulation, and to explore novel ideas in massively parallel machine architecture and software. This project should enable biomolecular simulations that are orders of magnitude larger than current technology permits. Major areas of investigation include: how to most effectively utilize this novel platform to meet our scientific goals, how to make such massively parallel machines more usable, and how to achieve performance targets, with reasonable cost, through novel machine architectures. This paper provides an overview of the Blue Gene project at IBM Research. It includes some of the plans that have been made, the intended goals, and the anticipated challenges regarding the scientific work, the software applic ation, and the hardware design.","displayPublicationTitle":"IBM Systems Journal","pdfPath":"/iel5/5288519/5386969/05386970.pdf","startPage":"310","endPage":"327","publicationTitle":"IBM Systems Journal","doi":"10.1147/sj.402.0310","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1147/sj.402.0310","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5386969","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5386970","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Blue Gene: A vision for protein science using a petaflop supercomputer","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IBM","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5386970/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2001","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"2001","displayDocTitle":"Blue Gene: A vision for protein science using a petaflop supercomputer","volume":"40","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"2001","dateOfInsertion":"06 April 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Blue Gene: A vision for protein science using a petaflop supercomputer","sourcePdf":"allen.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.120673S","chronDate":"2001","isNumber":"5386969","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5288519","citationCount":"46","articleId":"5386970","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2001","subType":"IBM","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5386974,"authors":[{"name":"L.

DiscoveryLink provides users with a virtual database to which they can pose arbitrarily complex queries, even though the actual data needed to answer the query may originate from several different sources, and none of those sources, by itself, is capable of answering the query.

The CASP (Critical Assessment of Structure Prediction) blind prediction experiments aim to assess the prediction capabilities in the field. A limitation of CASP is that predictions are prepared and filed by humans using programs, and thus, what is being evaluated is the performance of the predicting groups rather than the performance of the programs themselves. To address this limitation, the Critical Assessment of Fully Automated Structure Prediction (CAFASP) experiment was initiated in 1998. In CAFASP, the participants are programs or Internet servers, and what is evaluated are their automatic results without allowing any human intervention. In this paper, we review in brief the current state of protein structure prediction and describe what has been learned from the CAFASP1 experiment, the evolution toward CAFASP2, and how we foresee the future of automated structure prediction. We observe that the histories of \u201cin silico\u201d structure prediction experiments and computer chess tournaments show some striking similarities as well as some differences. We question whether the major advances in automated protein structure prediction stem from novel insights of the protein folding problem, of protein evolution and function, or merely from the technical advances in the ways the evolutionary information available in the biological databases is exploited. We conclude with a speculation about the future, where interesting chess might only be observed in computer games and where the interpretation of the information encoded in the human genome may be achieved mainly through in silico biology.","doi":"10.1147/sj.402.0410","publicationTitle":"IBM Systems Journal","displayPublicationTitle":"IBM Systems Journal","pdfPath":"/iel5/5288519/5386969/05386985.pdf","startPage":"410","endPage":"425","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1147/sj.402.0410","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5386969","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Convergent evolution of protein structure prediction and computer chess tournaments: CASP, Kasparov, and CAFASP","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5386985","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IBM","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"2001","chronOrPublicationDate":"2001","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5386985/","displayDocTitle":"Convergent evolution of protein structure prediction and computer chess tournaments: CASP, Kasparov, and CAFASP","volume":"40","issue":"2","publicationDate":"2001","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 April 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Convergent evolution of protein structure prediction and computer chess tournaments: CASP, Kasparov, and CAFASP","sourcePdf":"siew.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.023979S","chronDate":"2001","isNumber":"5386969","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5288519","citationCount":"3","articleId":"5386985","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2001","subType":"IBM","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":5387031,"authors":[{"name":"R.

This paper highlights research at the MIT Media Laboratory aimed at giving computers the ability to comfortably sense, recognize, and respond to the human communication of emotion, especially affective states such as frustration, confusion, interest, distress, anger, and joy. Two main themes of sensing\u2014self-report and concurrent expression\u2014are described, together with examples of systems that give users new ways to communicate emotion to computers and, through computers, to other people. In addition to building systems that try to elicit and detect frustration, our research group has built a system that responds to user frustration in a way that appears to help alleviate it. This paper highlights applications of this research to interface design, wearable computing, entertainment, and education, and briefly presents some potential ethical concerns and how they might be addressed.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IBM","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5387031/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"2000","chronOrPublicationDate":"2000","publicationDate":"2000","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 April 2010","volume":"39","issue":"3.4","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Toward computers that recognize and respond to user emotion","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Toward computers that recognize and respond to user emotion","sourcePdf":"picard.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.026526S","chronDate":"2000","isNumber":"5387004","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5288519","citationCount":"36","articleId":"5387031","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IBM","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5387040,"authors":[{"name":"E.

We compare textiles to existing flexible circuit substrates with regard to durability, conformability, and wearability. We also report on: some unique applications enabled by our work; the construction of sensors and user interface elements in textiles; and a complete process for creating flexible multilayer circuits on fabric substrates.

As the popularity of the Web has exploded, there is a strong desire to understand user surfing behavior. However, it is difficult to perform user-oriented data mining and analysis directly on the server log files because they tend to be ambiguous and incomplete. With innovative algorithms, SpeedTracer first identifies user sessions by reconstructing user traversal paths. It does not require \u201ccookies\u201d or user registration for session identification. User privacy is protected. Once user sessions are identified, data mining algorithms are then applied to discover the most common traversal paths and groups of pages frequently visited together. Important user browsing patterns are manifested through the frequent traversal paths and page groups, helping the understanding of user surfing behavior.

The switch incorporates a unique combination of topology and architectural features to scale aggregate bandwidth, enhance reliability, and simplify cabling. It is a bidirectional multistage interconnect subsystem driven by a common oscillator, and delivers both data and service packets over the same links. Switching elements contain a dynamically allocated shared buffer for storing blocked packet flits. The switch is constructed primarily from switching elements (the Vulcan switch chip) and adapters (the SP2 communication adapter). The SP2 communication adapter uses a variety of techniques to improve bandwidth and offload communication tasks from the node processor.

In this paper, we develop a model for conceptualizing and directing the emerging area of strategic management of information technology. This model, termed the Strategic Alignment Model, defined in terms of four fundamental domains of strategic choice: business strategy, information technology strategy, organizational infrastructure and processes, and information technology infrastructure and processes\u2014each with its own underlying dimensions. We illustrate the power of this model in terms of two fundamental characteristics of strategic management: strategic fit (the interrelationships between external and internal components) and functional integration (integration between business and functional domains). More specifically, we derive four perspectives of alignment with specific implications for guiding management practice in this important area.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5387392","publicationTitle":"IBM Systems Journal","displayPublicationTitle":"IBM Systems Journal","pdfPath":"/iel5/5288519/5387392/05387398.pdf","doi":"10.1147/sj.382.0472","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1147/sj.382.0472","startPage":"472","endPage":"484","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Strategic alignment: Leveraging information technology for transforming organizations","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IBM","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"1993","chronOrPublicationDate":"1993","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5387398/","displayDocTitle":"Strategic alignment: Leveraging information technology for transforming organizations","isJournal":true,"volume":"32","issue":"1","dateOfInsertion":"06 April 2010","publicationDate":"1993","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Strategic alignment: Leveraging information technology for transforming organizations","sourcePdf":"henderson.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.019904S","chronDate":"1993","isNumber":"5387392","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5288519","citationCount":"231","articleId":"5387398","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IBM","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5387444,"authors":[{"name":"A.

Some of these are of the public key variety and offer notable advantages in cryptographic key management, both for secret communication and for message authentication. The need for extensive arithmetic calculations with very large integers (hundreds of digits long) is a drawback of these systems. This paper describes a set of experimental programs that were developed to demonstrate that exponentiation cryptosystems can be efficiently implemented on the IBM Personal Computer (PC). The programs are organized into four layers, comprising procedures for: multiple precision integer arithmetic, modular exponentiation, prime number generation and testing, and cryptographic key generation. The major emphasis of the paper is on methods and techniques for improving execution speed. The items discussed include: the use of a specialized squaring procedure; a recursive splitting method to speed up squaring and multiplication; the computation of residues by using multiplication instead of division; the efficient encoding of residue information; and the use of thresholds to select the most effective primality testing algorithm for a given size number. Timing results are presented and discussed. Finally, the paper discusses the advantages of a mixed system that combines the superior key management capabilities inherent in public key cryptosystems with the much higher bulk-encryption speed obtainable with the Data Encryption Algorithm.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Exponentiation cryptosystems on the IBM PC","publicationTitle":"IBM Systems Journal","doi":"10.1147/sj.294.0526","displayPublicationTitle":"IBM Systems Journal","pdfPath":"/iel5/5288519/5387488/05387492.pdf","startPage":"526","endPage":"538","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1147/sj.294.0526","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5387488","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5387492","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IBM","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5387492/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"1990","chronOrPublicationDate":"1990","displayDocTitle":"Exponentiation cryptosystems on the IBM PC","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"29","issue":"4","dateOfInsertion":"06 April 2010","publicationDate":"1990","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Exponentiation cryptosystems on the IBM PC","sourcePdf":"ibmsj2904E.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.032873S","chronDate":"1990","isNumber":"5387488","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5288519","citationCount":"33","articleId":"5387492","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IBM","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5387580,"authors":[{"name":"B.

These issues will become more pressing over time and will precipitate substantial increases in the body of knowledge concerning enterprise analysis.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IBM","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"1982","chronOrPublicationDate":"1982","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5387856/","volume":"21","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"1982","dateOfInsertion":"06 April 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Business Systems Planning and Business Information Control Study: A comparison","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Business Systems Planning and Business Information Control Study: A comparison","sourcePdf":"ibmsj2101D.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.029849S","chronDate":"1982","isNumber":"5387853","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5288519","citationCount":"6","articleId":"5387856","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1982","subType":"IBM","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5387998,"authors":[{"name":"J.

The automatic sector reordering technique brings noticeable improvements in paging performance where there is room for improvement, reducing the necessary working space (for a given number of exceptions) by as much as one-third to one-half. We have worked entirely in the environment of a simple hierarchy of main memory and a uniform speed replacement memory, with all replacement blocks having the same size. We have found that the reordering process, assuming a page size of 4K bytes, also produces improvements on pages of 8K and 2K bytes with the improvements favoring the doubled page size over the halved. This is consistent with a tendency we have noticed in the programs we have examined for better packed memory to favor larger page sizes. But the page size for clustering bears a direct relationship to the program sectors themselves. It has not proved effective to cluster at the physical page size when the average sector size is half as large or more.

The number of words of information in a program often exceeds the number of cells (i.e., word locations) in memory. The only way to solve this problem is to assign more than one program word to a cell. Since a cell can hold only one word at a time, extra words assigned to the cell must be held in external storage. Conventionally, overlay techniques are employed to exchange memory words and external-storage words whenever needed; this, of course, places an additional planning and coding burden on the programmer.

An advanced packaging solution based on a thin silicon carrier has been developed to provide interconnection between integrated circuits (ICs) and other devices at densities far beyond those of current first-level packaging. The silicon carrier employs fine-pitch Cu damascene wiring, high-density solder interconnections, and through-silicon vias (TSVs). A key enabling technology element is the TSV, which may be naturally scaled to provide vertical interconnection in stacked ICs as well as silicon carriers. In this paper, we discuss the evolution in both TSV design and process flow that has led to TSV technology which produces vias with resistances on the order of 10\u201320 m\u03a9 and yields on the order of 99.99% at wafer level in a research laboratory environment. Two generalized process approaches to forming TSVs are discussed, the \u201cvias-first\u201d and the \u201cvias-last\u201d methods, along with related advantages and potential drawbacks of each. Improvement to these process flows and structures is afforded by simple changes of via geometry from cylindrical to annular or from annular to multibar. While various TSV metallurgies are reviewed, tungsten is shown to be a nearly optimal choice. Results on via resistance, electrical yield, and current-carrying capacity are covered. The use of electrical modeling to predict structures with superior electrical and mechanical properties is also described.","doi":"10.1147/JRD.2008.5388558","publicationTitle":"IBM Journal of Research and Development","displayPublicationTitle":"IBM Journal of Research and Development","pdfPath":"/iel5/5288520/5388557/05388558.pdf","startPage":"571","endPage":"581","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1147/JRD.2008.5388558","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5388557","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fabrication and characterization of robust through-silicon vias for silicon-carrier applications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5388558","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IBM","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov.  2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5388558/","displayDocTitle":"Fabrication and characterization of robust through-silicon vias for silicon-carrier applications","volume":"52","issue":"6","publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 April 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fabrication and characterization of robust through-silicon vias for silicon-carrier applications","sourcePdf":"andry.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.037192S","chronDate":"Nov.  2008","isNumber":"5388557","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5288520","citationCount":"52","articleId":"5388558","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IBM","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5388561,"authors":[{"name":"P.

Since Moore's Law, which has driven the evolution in systems for the last several decades, is imminently approaching real and severe limitations, the ability to create three-dimensional (3D) device stacks appears promising as a way to continue to integrate more devices into a \u201cchip.\u201d While on the one hand, this nascent ability to make \u201c3D technology\u201d can be interpreted as merely an extension of Moore's Law, on the other hand, the fact that systems can now be integrated across multiple planes poses some novel opportunities, as well as serious challenges and questions. In this paper, we explore these various challenges and opportunities and discuss structures and systems that are likely to be facilitated by 3D technology. We also describe the ways in which these systems are likely to change. Since 3D technology offers some different value propositions, we expect that some of the most important ways in which 3D technology will likely impact our approach to future systems design, implementation, and usage are not yet obvious to most system designers, and we outline several of them.","doi":"10.1147/JRD.2008.5388561","publicationTitle":"IBM Journal of Research and Development","displayPublicationTitle":"IBM Journal of Research and Development","pdfPath":"/iel5/5288520/5388557/05388561.pdf","startPage":"541","endPage":"552","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1147/JRD.2008.5388561","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5388557","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Is 3D chip technology the next growth engine for performance improvement?","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5388561","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IBM","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov.  2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5388561/","displayDocTitle":"Is 3D chip technology the next growth engine for performance improvement?","volume":"52","issue":"6","publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 April 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Is 3D chip technology the next growth engine for performance improvement?","sourcePdf":"emma.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.017496S","chronDate":"Nov.  2008","isNumber":"5388557","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5288520","citationCount":"79","articleId":"5388561","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IBM","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":5388563,"authors":[{"name":"A.

The tungsten-filled, multifinger, bar-shaped TSV delivers more than a 75% reduction in inductance compared to a traditional wirebond. This enables higher frequency applications with a roughly 20% reduction in die area without compromising the technology reliability for use conditions in a low-cost plastic QFN (quad flat no leads) package.

There are several approaches for 3D chip stacking including chip to chip, chip to wafer, and wafer to wafer. Chip-to-chip integration and chip-to-wafer integration offer the ability to stack known good dies, which can lead to higher yields without integrated redundancy. In the future, with structure and process optimization, wafer-to-wafer integration may provide an ultimate solution for the highest manufacturing throughput assuming a high yield and minimal loss of good dies and wafers. In the near term, chip-to-chip and chip-to-wafer integration may offer high yield, high flexibility, and high performance with added time-to-market advantages. In this work, results are reported for 3D integration after using a chip-to-wafer assembly process using 3D chip-stacking technology and fine-pitch interconnects with lead-free solder. Stacks of up to six dies were assembled and characterized using lead-free solder interconnections that were less than 6 \u00b5m in height. The average resistance of the TSV including the lead-free solder interconnect was as low as 21 m\u03a9.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1147/JRD.2008.5388567","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5388557","publicationTitle":"IBM Journal of Research and Development","displayPublicationTitle":"IBM Journal of Research and Development","pdfPath":"/iel5/5288520/5388557/05388567.pdf","endPage":"622","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"3D chip-stacking technology with through-silicon vias and low-volume lead-free interconnections","doi":"10.1147/JRD.2008.5388567","startPage":"611","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5388567","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IBM","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov.  2008","displayDocTitle":"3D chip-stacking technology with through-silicon vias and low-volume lead-free interconnections","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5388567/","dateOfInsertion":"06 April 2010","publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"52","issue":"6","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"3D chip-stacking technology with through-silicon vias and low-volume lead-free interconnections","sourcePdf":"sakuma.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.02305S","chronDate":"Nov.  2008","isNumber":"5388557","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5288520","citationCount":"76","articleId":"5388567","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IBM","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":5388568,"authors":[{"name":"S.

Fabrication costs of electronic packaging prototypes can be prohibitive; therefore, the building of effective virtual prototypes provides an important challenge for the modeling community. Fortunately, finite-element modeling (FEM) has become sufficiently mature to allow technologists to develop reliable insights into the thermal and mechanical integrity of proposed structures. For modeling to be leveraged as an effective means of avoiding thermally related mechanical problems, the diversity in size scale found in three-dimensional electronic packages must be carefully considered and addressed. Employing three distinct examples, we summarize our experience and insights in applying FEM in order to make informed decisions in the early stages of product package research and development.","doi":"10.1147/JRD.2008.5388568","publicationTitle":"IBM Journal of Research and Development","displayPublicationTitle":"IBM Journal of Research and Development","pdfPath":"/iel5/5288520/5388557/05388568.pdf","startPage":"623","endPage":"634","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1147/JRD.2008.5388568","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5388557","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5388568","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Thermomechanical modeling of 3D electronic packages","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IBM","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov.  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5388568/","displayDocTitle":"Thermomechanical modeling of 3D electronic packages","volume":"52","issue":"6","publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 April 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Thermomechanical modeling of 3D electronic packages","sourcePdf":"sri-jayantha.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.028634S","chronDate":"Nov.  2008","isNumber":"5388557","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5288520","citationCount":"23","articleId":"5388568","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IBM","lastupdate":"2021-09-28"},{"_id":5388573,"authors":[{"name":"E.

The critical components of the IBM System z10\u2122 I/O subsystem have, therefore, been significantly improved in terms of performance, capability, and cost. The first-order network has been redesigned from the long-evolved enhanced self-timed interface (eSTI) links to utilize InfiniBand\u2122 links. A redesign of the host logic of I/O chips and the fiberoptic interfaces within the links made it possible to introduce InfiniBand-based IBM Parallel Sysplex\u00ae links. A broad range of legacy I/O channels have been carried forward to connect through InfiniBand, and a foundation has been laid for new channel types of improved functionality and performance. The first such hardware channel to be introduced is the next generation of Ethernet-virtualization data routers. A new and methodical recovery structure has been designed to ensure consistent, extensive support of reliability, availability, and serviceability. A building-block-oriented design process has been developed to enable the innovations that made these advances possible. Finally, a new performance verification methodology has been introduced to ensure that the system and subsystem designs are balanced to make effective use of the increased capacity.","doi":"10.1147/JRD.2009.5388573","publicationTitle":"IBM Journal of Research and Development","displayPublicationTitle":"IBM Journal of Research and Development","pdfPath":"/iel5/5288520/5388570/05388573.pdf","startPage":"6:1","endPage":"6:13","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1147/JRD.2009.5388573","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5388570","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"IBM System z10 I/O subsystem","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5388573","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IBM","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5388573/","displayDocTitle":"IBM System z10 I/O subsystem","volume":"53","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2009","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 April 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"IBM System z10 I/O subsystem","sourcePdf":"chencinski.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.030083S","chronDate":"Jan.  2009","isNumber":"5388570","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5288520","citationCount":"5","articleId":"5388573","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IBM","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5388579,"authors":[{"name":"P.

This is true even though both cosmic ray-induced and alpha-particle-induced DRAM soft errors have been well modeled and, to a certain degree, well understood. However, the often-overlooked alignment of a DRAM hard error and a random soft error can have major reliability, availability, and serviceability (RAS) implications for systems that require an extremely long mean time between failures. The net of this effect is that what appears to be a well-behaved, single-bit soft error ends up overwhelming a seemingly state-of-the-art mitigation technique. This paper describes some of the history of DRAM soft-error discovery and the subsequent development of mitigation strategies. It then examines some architectural considerations that can exacerbate the effect of DRAM soft errors and may have system-level implications for today's standard fault-tolerance schemes.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"System RAS implications of DRAM soft errors","doi":"10.1147/rd.523.0307","startPage":"307","endPage":"314","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1147/rd.523.0307","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5388590","publicationTitle":"IBM Journal of Research and Development","displayPublicationTitle":"IBM Journal of Research and Development","pdfPath":"/iel5/5288520/5388590/05388592.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5388592","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IBM","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5388592/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2008","displayDocTitle":"System RAS implications of DRAM soft errors","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"52","issue":"3","dateOfInsertion":"06 April 2010","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May 2008","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"System RAS implications of DRAM soft errors","sourcePdf":"dell.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.014695S","chronDate":"May  2008","isNumber":"5388590","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5288520","citationCount":"4","articleId":"5388592","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IBM","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5388594,"authors":[{"name":"D.

Such a device would require a solid-state nonvolatile memory technology that could be manufactured at an extremely high effective areal density using some combination of sublithographic patterning techniques, multiple bits per cell, and multiple layers of devices. We review the candidate solid-state nonvolatile memory technologies that potentially could be used to construct such an SCM. We discuss evolutionary extensions of conventional flash memory, such as SONOS (silicon-oxide-nitride-oxide-silicon) and nanotraps, as well as a number of revolutionary new memory technologies. We review the capabilities of ferroelectric, magnetic, phase-change, and resistive random-access memories, including perovskites and solid electrolytes, and finally organic and polymeric memory. The potential for practical scaling to ultrahigh effective areal density for each of these candidate technologies is then compared.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IBM","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5388605/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"July  2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2008","volume":"52","issue":"4.5","dateOfInsertion":"06 April 2010","publicationDate":"July 2008","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Overview of candidate device technologies for storage-class memory","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Overview of candidate device technologies for storage-class memory","sourcePdf":"burr.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.024445S","chronDate":"July  2008","isNumber":"5388602","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5288520","citationCount":"145","articleId":"5388605","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IBM","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5388606,"authors":[{"name":"S.

Automated planners can assist administrators in making intelligent placement and resiliency decisions when provisioning for both new and existing applications. Such planners take advantage of recent improvements in storage resource management and provide guided recommendations based on monitored performance data and storage models. For example, the IBM Provisioning Planner provides intelligent decision-making for the steps involved in allocating and assigning storage for workloads. It involves planning for the number, size, and location of volumes on the basis of workload performance requirements and hierarchical constraints, planning for the appropriate number of paths, and enabling access to volumes using zoning, masking, and mapping. The IBM Disaster Recovery (DR) Planner enables administrators to choose and deploy appropriate replication technologies spanning servers, the network, and storage volumes to provide resiliency to the provisioned application. The DR Planner begins with a list of high-level application DR requirements and creates an integrated plan that is optimized on criteria such as cost and solution homogeneity. The Planner deploys the selected plan using orchestrators that are responsible for failover and failback.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IBM","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"July  2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5388606/","volume":"52","issue":"4.5","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"July 2008","dateOfInsertion":"06 April 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Automated planners for storage provisioning and disaster recovery","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Automated planners for storage provisioning and disaster recovery","sourcePdf":"butler.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.029149S","chronDate":"July  2008","isNumber":"5388602","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5288520","citationCount":"8","articleId":"5388606","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IBM","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5388608,"authors":[{"name":"R.

Using SCM as a disk drive replacement, storage system products will have random and sequential I/O performance that is orders of magnitude better than that of comparable disk-based systems and require much less space and power in the data center. In this paper, we extrapolate disk and SCM technology trends to 2020 and analyze the impact on storage systems.

This success was made possible by the continuous innovation of the industry along many different fronts. In this paper, the history, the basic science, and the successes of flash memories are briefly presented. Flash memories have followed the Moore's Law scaling trend for which finer line widths, achieved by improved lithographic resolution, enable more memory bits to be produced for the same silicon area, reducing cost per bit. When looking toward the future, significant challenges exist to the continued scaling of flash memories. In this paper, I discuss possible areas that need development in order to overcome some of the size-scaling challenges. Innovations are expected to continue in the industry, and flash memories will continue to follow the historical trend in cost reduction of semiconductor memories through the rest of this decade.","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5388612","doi":"10.1147/rd.524.0529","displayPublicationTitle":"IBM Journal of Research and Development","pdfPath":"/iel5/5288520/5388602/05388612.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1147/rd.524.0529","startPage":"529","endPage":"535","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5388602","publicationTitle":"IBM Journal of Research and Development","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Flash memories: Successes and challenges","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IBM","displayDocTitle":"Flash memories: Successes and challenges","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5388612/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"July  2008","volume":"52","issue":"4.5","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 April 2010","publicationDate":"July 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Flash memories: Successes and challenges","sourcePdf":"lai.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.017225S","chronDate":"July  2008","isNumber":"5388602","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5288520","citationCount":"14","articleId":"5388612","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IBM","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5388616,"authors":[{"name":"D.

The object-based storage interface provides an organizational container, called an object, into which higher-level software (e.g., file systems, databases, and user applications) can store both data and related attributes. In 2004, the ANSI (American National Standards Institute) T10 Standards body ratified an Object-based Storage Device (OSD) command set for SCSI (Small Computer System Interface) storage devices that implements the OSD interface. This paper describes the rationale for OSDs, highlights the ANSI T10 OSD V1.0 interface, and presents three OSD implementations: an OSD from Seagate, an IBM object-based storage prototype (ObjectStone), and the Panasas object-based distributed storage system.","doi":"10.1147/rd.524.0401","publicationTitle":"IBM Journal of Research and Development","displayPublicationTitle":"IBM Journal of Research and Development","pdfPath":"/iel5/5288520/5388602/05388616.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1147/rd.524.0401","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5388602","startPage":"401","endPage":"411","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The ANSI T10 object-based storage standard and current implementations","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5388616","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IBM","displayDocTitle":"The ANSI T10 object-based storage standard and current implementations","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5388616/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"July  2008","isJournal":true,"volume":"52","issue":"4.5","publicationDate":"July 2008","dateOfInsertion":"06 April 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The ANSI T10 object-based storage standard and current implementations","sourcePdf":"nagle.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.035303S","chronDate":"July  2008","isNumber":"5388602","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5288520","citationCount":"7","articleId":"5388616","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IBM","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5388621,"authors":[{"name":"S.

However, such a technology can succeed only if it can scale smaller in size, given the increasingly tiny memory cells that are projected for future technology nodes (i.e., generations). We first discuss the critical aspects that may affect the scaling of PCRAM, including materials properties, power consumption during programming and read operations, thermal cross-talk between memory cells, and failure mechanisms. We then discuss experiments that directly address the scaling properties of the phase-change materials themselves, including studies of phase transitions in both nanoparticles and ultrathin films as a function of particle size and film thickness. This work in materials directly motivated the successful creation of a series of prototype PCRAM devices, which have been fabricated and tested at phase-change material cross-sections with extremely small dimensions as low as 3 nm \u00d7 20 nm. These device measurements provide a clear demonstration of the excellent scaling potential offered by this technology, and they are also consistent with the scaling behavior predicted by extensive device simulations. Finally, we discuss issues of device integration and cell design, manufacturability, and reliability.","doi":"10.1147/rd.524.0465","publicationTitle":"IBM Journal of Research and Development","displayPublicationTitle":"IBM Journal of Research and Development","pdfPath":"/iel5/5288520/5388602/05388621.pdf","startPage":"465","endPage":"479","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5388602","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1147/rd.524.0465","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Phase-change random access memory: A scalable technology","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5388621","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IBM","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2008","displayDocTitle":"Phase-change random access memory: A scalable technology","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5388621/","publicationDate":"July 2008","dateOfInsertion":"06 April 2010","isJournal":true,"volume":"52","issue":"4.5","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"July  2008","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Phase-change random access memory: A scalable technology","sourcePdf":"raoux.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.041904S","chronDate":"July  2008","isNumber":"5388602","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5288520","citationCount":"226","articleId":"5388621","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IBM","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5388626,"authors":[{"name":"L.

The introduction of new technology including denser circuits, improved lithography, and higher clock speeds means that power consumption and heat generation, which are already significant problems with older systems, are significantly greater with IBM POWER6\u2122 processor-based designs, including both standalone servers and those implemented as blades for the IBM BladeCenter\u00ae product line. In response, IBM has developed the EnergyScale\u2122 architecture, a system-level power management implementation for POWER6 processor-based machines. The EnergyScale architecture uses the basic power control facilities of the POWER6 chip, together with additional board-level hardware, firmware, and systems software, to provide a complete power and thermal management solution. The EnergyScale architecture is performance aware, taking into account the characteristics of the executing workload to ensure that it meets the goals specified by the user while reducing power consumption. This paper introduces the EnergyScale architecture and describes its implementation in two representative platform designs: an eight-way, rack-mounted machine and a server blade. The primary focus of this paper is on the algorithms and the firmware structure used in the EnergyScale architecture, although it also provides the system design considerations needed to support performance-aware power management. In addition, it describes the extensions and modifications to power management that are necessary to span the range of POWER6 processor-based system designs.","doi":"10.1147/rd.516.0775","publicationTitle":"IBM Journal of Research and Development","displayPublicationTitle":"IBM Journal of Research and Development","pdfPath":"/iel5/5288520/5388622/05388630.pdf","startPage":"775","endPage":"786","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1147/rd.516.0775","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5388622","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"EnergyScale for IBM POWER6 microprocessor-based systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5388630","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IBM","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov.  2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5388630/","displayDocTitle":"EnergyScale for IBM POWER6 microprocessor-based systems","volume":"51","issue":"6","publicationDate":"Nov. 2007","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 April 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"EnergyScale for IBM POWER6 microprocessor-based systems","sourcePdf":"mccreary.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.038559S","chronDate":"Nov.  2007","isNumber":"5388622","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5288520","citationCount":"10","articleId":"5388630","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IBM","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5388631,"authors":[{"name":"D.

Advancements in performance (2X to 3X improvement over the 90-nm generation) and design margins (cell stability, writability, and redundancy coverage) were major focus areas. Key elements of the POWER6 processor chip arrays include paradigm shifts such as thin memory cell layout, large signal read (without a sense amplifier), segmented bitline structure, unclamped column-half-select scheme, multidimensional programmable timing control, and separate elevated static random access memory (SRAM) power supply. There are two main array categories on the POWER6 microprocessor chip: core and nest. Processor core arrays use a single-port, 0.75-\u00b5m\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n, six-transistor (6T) cell and operate at full frequency, whereas the surrounding nest arrays use a smaller 0.65-\u00b5m\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n cell that operates at half or one-quarter of the core frequency in order to achieve better density and power efficiency. The core arrays include the 96-KB instruction cache (I-cache) and the 64-KB data cache (D-cache), with associate lookup-path SRAM macros. The I-cache is a four-way set-associative, single-port design, whereas the D-cache is an eight-way design with dual read ports to handle multithreading capability. The lookup-path arrays contain content-addressable memory (CAM) and RAM macros with integrated dynamic hit logic circuitry. In the nest portion, an 8-MB level 2 (L2) D-cache and a level 3 (L3) directory (1.2 MB) make up the largest arrays. The latter macro designs use longer bitlines and orthogonal word-decode layouts to achieve high array-area efficiency.","doi":"10.1147/rd.516.0747","publicationTitle":"IBM Journal of Research and Development","displayPublicationTitle":"IBM Journal of Research and Development","pdfPath":"/iel5/5288520/5388622/05388631.pdf","startPage":"747","endPage":"756","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1147/rd.516.0747","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5388622","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"IBM POWER6 SRAM arrays","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IBM","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5388631/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov.  2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2007","displayDocTitle":"IBM POWER6 SRAM arrays","volume":"51","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"06 April 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"IBM POWER6 SRAM arrays","sourcePdf":"plass.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.031831S","chronDate":"Nov.  2007","isNumber":"5388622","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5288520","citationCount":"10","articleId":"5388631","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IBM","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5388634,"authors":[{"name":"E.

The Car\u2013Parrinello ab initio molecular dynamics (CPAIMD) method is widely used to study small systems containing on the order of 10 to 10\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">3</sup>\n atoms. However, the impact of CPAIMD has been limited until recently because of difficulties inherent to scaling the technique beyond processor numbers about equal to the number of electronic states. CPAIMD computations involve a large number of interdependent phases with high interprocessor communication overhead. These phases require the evaluation of various transforms and non-square matrix multiplications that require large interprocessor data movement when efficiently parallelized. Using the Charm++ parallel programming language and runtime system, the phases are discretized into a large number of virtual processors, which are, in turn, mapped flexibly onto physical processors, thereby allowing interleaving of work. Algorithmic and IBM Blue Gene/L\u2122 system-specific optimizations are employed to scale the CPAIMD method to at least 30 times the number of electronic states in small systems consisting of 24 to 768 atoms (32 to 1,024 electronic states) in order to demonstrate fine-grained parallelism. The largest systems studied scaled well across the entire machine (20,480 nodes).","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fine-grained parallelization of the Car-Parrinello ab initio molecular dynamics method on the IBM Blue Gene/L supercomputer","publicationTitle":"IBM Journal of Research and Development","doi":"10.1147/rd.521.0159","displayPublicationTitle":"IBM Journal of Research and Development","pdfPath":"/iel5/5288520/5388633/05388634.pdf","startPage":"159","endPage":"175","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1147/rd.521.0159","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5388633","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5388634","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IBM","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5388634/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2008","displayDocTitle":"Fine-grained parallelization of the Car-Parrinello ab initio molecular dynamics method on the IBM Blue Gene/L supercomputer","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"52","issue":"1.2","dateOfInsertion":"06 April 2010","publicationDate":"Jan. 2008","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fine-grained parallelization of the Car-Parrinello ab initio molecular dynamics method on the IBM Blue Gene/L supercomputer","sourcePdf":"bohm.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.040457S","chronDate":"Jan.  2008","isNumber":"5388633","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5288520","citationCount":"10","articleId":"5388634","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IBM","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5388638,"authors":[{"name":"M.

We present an overview, for the general technical reader, of a neuronal network model of layers II/III of the neocortex built with biophysical model neurons. These simulations, carried out on an IBM Blue Gene/L\u2122 supercomputer, comprise up to 22 million neurons and 11 billion synapses, which makes them the largest simulations of this type ever performed. Such model sizes correspond to the cortex of a small mammal. The SPLIT library, used for these simulations, runs on single-processor as well as massively parallel machines. Performance measurements show good scaling behavior on the Blue Gene/L supercomputer up to 8,192 processors. Several key phenomena seen in the living brain appear as emergent phenomena in the simulations. We discuss the role of this kind of model in neuroscience and note that full-scale models may be necessary to preserve natural dynamics. We also discuss the need for software tools for the specification of models as well as for analysis and visualization of output data. Combining models that range from abstract connectionist type to biophysically detailed will help us unravel the basic principles underlying neocortical function.","displayPublicationTitle":"IBM Journal of Research and Development","pdfPath":"/iel5/5288520/5388633/05388638.pdf","startPage":"31","endPage":"41","publicationTitle":"IBM Journal of Research and Development","doi":"10.1147/rd.521.0031","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1147/rd.521.0031","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5388633","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5388638","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Brain-scale simulation of the neocortex on the IBM Blue Gene/L supercomputer","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IBM","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5388638/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  2008","displayDocTitle":"Brain-scale simulation of the neocortex on the IBM Blue Gene/L supercomputer","volume":"52","issue":"1.2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"06 April 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Brain-scale simulation of the neocortex on the IBM Blue Gene/L supercomputer","sourcePdf":"djurfeldt.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.042564S","chronDate":"Jan.  2008","isNumber":"5388633","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5288520","citationCount":"15","articleId":"5388638","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IBM","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5388642,"authors":[{"name":"F.

Hence, we need MD applications to scale to thousands of processors, even though the individual timestep on one processor is quite small. NAMD has demonstrated its performance on several parallel computer architectures. In this paper, we present various compiler optimization techniques that use single-instruction, multiple-data (SIMD) instructions to obtain good sequential performance with NAMD on the embedded IBM PowerPC\u00ae 440 processor core. We also present several techniques to scale the NAMD application to 20,480 nodes of the IBM Blue Gene/L\u2122 (BG/L) system. These techniques include topology-specific optimizations to localize communication, new messaging protocols that are optimized for the BG/L torus, topology-aware load balancing, and overlap of computation and communication.

For most proteins, the \u201cnative state\u201d lies at the bottom of a free-energy landscape. Protein structure prediction involves varying the degrees of freedom of the protein in a constrained manner until it approaches its native state. In the Rosetta protein structure prediction protocols, a large number of independent folding trajectories are simulated, and several lowest-energy results are likely to be close to the native state. The availability of hundred-teraflop, and shortly, petaflop, computing resources is revolutionizing the approaches available for protein structure prediction. Here, we discuss issues involved in utilizing such machines efficiently with the Rosetta code, including an overview of recent results of the Critical Assessment of Techniques for Protein Structure Prediction 7 (CASP7) in which the computationally demanding structure-refinement process was run on 16 racks of the IBM Blue Gene/L\u2122 system at the IBM T.

In this paper we show that the Cell/B.E. processor can outperform other modern processors by approximately an order of magnitude and by even more in some cases.","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5388675","doi":"10.1147/rd.515.0559","displayPublicationTitle":"IBM Journal of Research and Development","pdfPath":"/iel5/5288520/5388673/05388675.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1147/rd.515.0559","startPage":"559","endPage":"572","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5388673","publicationTitle":"IBM Journal of Research and Development","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cell Broadband Engine Architecture and its first implementation\u2014A performance view","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IBM","displayDocTitle":"Cell Broadband Engine Architecture and its first implementation\u2014A performance view","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5388675/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  2007","volume":"51","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 April 2010","publicationDate":"Sept. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cell Broadband Engine Architecture and its first implementation\u2014A performance view","sourcePdf":"chen.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.023925S","chronDate":"Sept.  2007","isNumber":"5388673","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5288520","citationCount":"73","articleId":"5388675","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IBM","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5388679,"authors":[{"name":"A.

One important area of focus for performance improvement involves chip-to-chip interconnects, with their associated bandwidths and latencies. IBM and related computer manufacturers are optimizing the characteristics of interconnects between processors as well as between processors and their supporting chip sets (local cache, memory, I/O bridge). This paper describes the IBM proprietary high-speed interface known as Elastic Interface (EI), which is used for nearly all chip-to-chip communication in the IBM System z9\u2122. In particular, EI is a generic high-speed, source-synchronous interface used to transfer addresses, controls, and data between CPUs, L2 caches, memory subsystems, switches, and I/O hubs. The EI has single-ended data lines, resulting in twice the performance (bandwidth per pin) of similar buses operating with two differential lines per signal.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IBM","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5388702/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  2007","volume":"51","issue":"1.2","publicationDate":"Jan. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"06 April 2010","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"High-speed source-synchronous interface for the IBM System z9 processor","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High-speed source-synchronous interface for the IBM System z9 processor","sourcePdf":"berger.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.035924S","chronDate":"Jan.  2007","isNumber":"5388699","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5288520","citationCount":"4","articleId":"5388702","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IBM","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5388704,"authors":[{"name":"A.

System z9\u2122 is the first IBM machine to support the DFP instructions. We present an overview of this implementation and provide some measurement of the performance gained using hardware assists. Various tools and techniques employed for the DFP verification on unit, element, and system levels are presented in detail.

The primary objective is to obtain as much performance as possible for a fixed amount of power, and it is chip performance, not device performance, that matters. In order to investigate this regime, we have captured in simplified models the basic elements for determining chip performance, including intrinsic transistor characteristics, circuit delay, tolerance issues, basic microprocessor composition, and power dissipation and heat removal considerations. These models have been assembled in a processor-level technology-optimization program to study the characteristics of optimal technology across many generations of CMOS. The results that are presented elucidate the limits of future CMOS technology improvements, the optimal energy consumption conditions, and the relative benefits of various proposed technology enhancements, including high-k gate insulators, metal gates, high-mobility semiconductors, improved heat removal, and the use of multiple layers of circuitry.","doi":"10.1147/rd.504.0419","publicationTitle":"IBM Journal of Research and Development","displayPublicationTitle":"IBM Journal of Research and Development","pdfPath":"/iel5/5288520/5388736/05388741.pdf","startPage":"419","endPage":"431","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1147/rd.504.0419","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5388736","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimizing CMOS technology for maximum performance","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5388741","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IBM","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"July  2006","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5388741/","displayDocTitle":"Optimizing CMOS technology for maximum performance","volume":"50","issue":"4.5","publicationDate":"July 2006","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 April 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimizing CMOS technology for maximum performance","sourcePdf":"frank.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.02634S","chronDate":"July  2006","isNumber":"5388736","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5288520","citationCount":"30","articleId":"5388741","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IBM","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5388742,"authors":[{"name":"E.

However, a closer look reveals that early signs of scaling limits were seen in high-performance devices in recent technology nodes. To obtain the projected performance gain of 30% per generation, device designers have been forced to relax the device subthreshold leakage continuously from one to several nA/\u00b5m for the 250-nm node to hundreds of nA/\u00b5m for the 65-nm node. Consequently, passive power density is now a significant portion of the power budget of a high-speed microprocessor. In this paper we discuss device and material options to improve device performance when conventional scaling is power-constrained. These options can be separated into three categories: improved short-channel behavior, improved current drive, and improved switching behavior. In the first category fall advanced dielectrics and multi-gate devices. The second category comprises mobility-enhancing measures through stress and substrate material alternatives. The third category focuses mainly on scaling of SOI body thickness to reduce capacitance. We do not provide details of the fabrication of these different device options or the manufacturing challenges that must be met. Rather, we discuss the fundamental scaling issues related to the various device options. We conclude with a brief discussion of the ultimate FET close to the fundamental silicon device limit.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1147/rd.504.0339","doi":"10.1147/rd.504.0339","displayPublicationTitle":"IBM Journal of Research and Development","pdfPath":"/iel5/5288520/5388736/05388743.pdf","startPage":"339","endPage":"361","publicationTitle":"IBM Journal of Research and Development","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5388736","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Silicon CMOS devices beyond scaling","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IBM","displayDocTitle":"Silicon CMOS devices beyond scaling","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5388743/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2006","isJournal":true,"volume":"50","issue":"4.5","publicationDate":"July 2006","dateOfInsertion":"06 April 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"July  2006","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Silicon CMOS devices beyond scaling","sourcePdf":"haensch_a.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.026786S","chronDate":"July  2006","isNumber":"5388736","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5288520","citationCount":"101","articleId":"5388743","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IBM","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5388745,"authors":[{"name":"S.

We begin with a study at the device level, and we show that extreme sensitivity to the supply and threshold voltages complicates subthreshold design. The effects of this sensitivity can be minimized through simple device modifications and new device geometries. At the circuit level, we review the energy characteristics of subthreshold logic and SRAM circuits, and demonstrate that energy efficiency relies on the balance between dynamic and leakage energies, with process variability playing a key role in both energy efficiency and robustness. We continue the study of energy-efficient design by broadening our scope to the architectural level. We discuss the energy benefits of techniques such as multiple-threshold CMOS (MTCMOS) and adaptive body biasing (ABB), and we also consider the performance benefits of multiprocessor design at ultralow supply voltages.","displayPublicationTitle":"IBM Journal of Research and Development","pdfPath":"/iel5/5288520/5388736/05388745.pdf","startPage":"469","endPage":"490","publicationTitle":"IBM Journal of Research and Development","doi":"10.1147/rd.504.0469","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1147/rd.504.0469","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5388736","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5388745","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Ultralow-voltage, minimum-energy CMOS","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IBM","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5388745/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2006","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"July  2006","displayDocTitle":"Ultralow-voltage, minimum-energy CMOS","volume":"50","issue":"4.5","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"July 2006","dateOfInsertion":"06 April 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Ultralow-voltage, minimum-energy CMOS","sourcePdf":"hanson.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.038128S","chronDate":"July  2006","isNumber":"5388736","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5288520","citationCount":"107","articleId":"5388745","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IBM","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5388751,"authors":[{"name":"A.

They also provide for microchip architecture and may facilitate the integration of heterogeneous materials, devices, and signals. However, before these advantages can be realized, key technology challenges of 3D ICs must be addressed. More specifically, the processes required to build circuits with multiple layers of active devices must be compatible with current state-of-the-art silicon processing technology. These processes must also show manufacturability, i.e., reliability, good yield, maturity, and reasonable cost. To meet these requirements, IBM has introduced a scheme for building 3D ICs based on the layer transfer of functional circuits, and many process and design innovations have been implemented. This paper reviews the process steps and design aspects that were developed at IBM to enable the formation of stacked device layers. Details regarding an optimized layer transfer process are presented, including the descriptions of 1) a glass substrate process to enable through-wafer alignment; 2) oxide fusion bonding and wafer bow compensation methods for improved alignment tolerance during bonding; 3) and a single-damascene patterning and metallization method for the creation of high-aspect-ratio (6:1 < AR < 11:1) contacts between two stacked device layers. This process provides the shortest distance between the stacked layers (<2 \u00b5m), the highest interconnection density (>10\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">8</sup>\n vias/cm\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n), and extremely aggressive wafer-to-wafer alignment (submicron) capability.","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5388751","doi":"10.1147/rd.504.0491","displayPublicationTitle":"IBM Journal of Research and Development","pdfPath":"/iel5/5288520/5388736/05388751.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1147/rd.504.0491","startPage":"491","endPage":"506","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5388736","publicationTitle":"IBM Journal of Research and Development","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Three-dimensional integrated circuits","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IBM","displayDocTitle":"Three-dimensional integrated circuits","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5388751/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2006","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"July  2006","volume":"50","issue":"4.5","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 April 2010","publicationDate":"July 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Three-dimensional integrated circuits","sourcePdf":"topol.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.051425S","chronDate":"July  2006","isNumber":"5388736","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5288520","citationCount":"258","articleId":"5388751","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IBM","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5388770,"authors":[{"name":"D.

We report here on a novel test site design and an associated thin-film process integration scheme which permit relatively inexpensive, rapid characterization of the critical elements in MRAM device fabrication. The test site design incorporates circuitry consistent with the use of a large-area planar base electrode to enable a processing scheme with only two photomask levels. The thin-film process integration scheme is a modification of standard BEOL processing to accommodate temperature-sensitive magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs) and poor-shear-strength magnetic film interfaces. Completed test site wafers are testable with high-speed probing techniques, permitting characterization of large numbers of MTJs for statistically significant analyses.

Following that, we discuss the development of the magnetic random access memory (MRAM) technology, in which the magnetic tunnel junction serves as both the storage device and the storage sensing device. The emphasis is on work at IBM, including demonstrations of basic capabilities of the technology and work on a 16-Mb \u201cproduct demonstrator\u201d design in 180-nm node technology, which was targeted to be a realistic test bed for the MRAM technology. Performance and cost are compared with those of competing technologies. The paper also serves as an introduction to more specialized papers in this issue on MRAM device physics, magnetic tunnel junction materials and device characterization, MRAM processing, and MRAM design.","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5388774","doi":"10.1147/rd.501.0005","displayPublicationTitle":"IBM Journal of Research and Development","pdfPath":"/iel5/5288520/5388769/05388774.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1147/rd.501.0005","startPage":"5","endPage":"23","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5388769","publicationTitle":"IBM Journal of Research and Development","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Development of the magnetic tunnel junction MRAM at IBM: From first junctions to a 16-Mb MRAM demonstrator chip","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IBM","displayDocTitle":"Development of the magnetic tunnel junction MRAM at IBM: From first junctions to a 16-Mb MRAM demonstrator chip","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5388774/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2006","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  2006","volume":"50","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 April 2010","publicationDate":"Jan. 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Development of the magnetic tunnel junction MRAM at IBM: From first junctions to a 16-Mb MRAM demonstrator chip","sourcePdf":"gallagher_a.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.01573S","chronDate":"Jan.  2006","isNumber":"5388769","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5288520","citationCount":"38","articleId":"5388774","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IBM","lastupdate":"2021-09-23"},{"_id":5388777,"authors":[{"name":"T.

The angular momentum transfer exerts a torque (spin-current induced torque, or spin-torque) on the ferromagnetic conductor.

This has now been definitively observed in sub-100-nm current-perpendicular spin-valves and magnetic tunnel junctions, and appears promising as a basis for direct write-address of a nanomagnetic bit when the lateral bit size is reduced to well below 100 nm. An overview is presented in this paper of spin-transfer phenomena. The first part of the paper contains a brief introduction to spin-transfer, especially the characteristic dynamics associated with spin-torque. In the second part, several representative experiments are described. In the third part, a set of basic phenomenological models are introduced that describe experimental observations. The models also serve as a bridge for quantitative comparison between experiments and first-principles spin-polarized transport theory. In the last part of the paper, some device concepts based on spin-transfer-induced magnetic excitation and magnetic reversal are described.","doi":"10.1147/rd.501.0081","publicationTitle":"IBM Journal of Research and Development","displayPublicationTitle":"IBM Journal of Research and Development","pdfPath":"/iel5/5288520/5388769/05388779.pdf","startPage":"81","endPage":"100","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1147/rd.501.0081","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5388769","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Spin angular momentum transfer in current-perpendicular nanomagnetic junctions","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IBM","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5388779/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2006","displayDocTitle":"Spin angular momentum transfer in current-perpendicular nanomagnetic junctions","dateOfInsertion":"06 April 2010","volume":"50","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2006","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spin angular momentum transfer in current-perpendicular nanomagnetic junctions","sourcePdf":"sun.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.012209S","chronDate":"Jan.  2006","isNumber":"5388769","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5288520","citationCount":"41","articleId":"5388779","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IBM","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5388780,"authors":[{"name":"S.

Conventional electronics are based on the charge of the electron. Attempts to use the other fundamental property of an electron, its spin, have given rise to a new, rapidly evolving field, known as spintronics, an acronym for spin transport electronics that was first introduced in 1996 to designate a program of the U.S. Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA). Initially, the spintronics program involved overseeing the development of advanced magnetic memory and sensors based on spin transport electronics. It was then expanded to included Spins IN Semiconductors (SPINS), in the hope of developing a new paradigm in semiconductor electronics based on the spin degree of freedom of the electron. Studies of spin-polarized transport in bulk and low-dimensional semiconductor structures show promise for the creation of a hybrid device that would combine magnetic storage with gain\u2014in effect, a spin memory transistor. This paper reviews some of the major developments in this field and provides a perspective of what we think will be the future of this exciting field. It is not meant to be a comprehensive review of the whole field but reflects a bias on the part of the authors toward areas that they believe will lead to significant future technologies.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IBM","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  2006","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5388780/","volume":"50","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2006","dateOfInsertion":"06 April 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Spintronics\u2014A retrospective and perspective","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spintronics\u2014A retrospective and perspective","sourcePdf":"wolf.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.027632S","chronDate":"Jan.  2006","isNumber":"5388769","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5288520","citationCount":"11","articleId":"5388780","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IBM","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5388781,"authors":[{"name":"D.

Two large installations\u2014of 8,192 and 12,288 nodes, with a combined peak speed of one teraflops\u2014have been in operation since.

Preliminary performance experiments on the BG/L prototype indicate that both of our implementations scale well up to 1,024 nodes for 3D FFTs of size 128 \u00d7 128 \u00d7 128. The performance of the volumetric FFT is also compared with that of the Fastest Fourier Transform in the West (FFTW) library.

These were significantly more complex than the linear algebra kernels that are normally provided as tuned libraries with modern machines. Using regular library functions for these would have resulted in an application that exploited only 5\u201310% of the potential floating-point throughput of the machine. This paper is a tour of the functions encountered; they have been expressed in C++ (and could be expressed in other languages such as Fortran or C). With the help of a good optimizing compiler, floating-point efficiency is much closer to 100%. The protein folding application was initially run by the life science researchers on IBM POWER3\u2122 machines while the computer science researchers were designing and bringing up the Blue Gene/L hardware. Some of the work discussed resulted in enhanced compiler optimizations, which now improve the performance of floating-point-intensive applications compiled by the IBM VisualAge\u00ae series of compilers for POWER3, POWER4\u2122, POWER4+\u2122, and POWER5\u2122. The implementations are offered in the hope that they may help in other implementations of molecular dynamics or in other fields of endeavor, and in the hope that others may adapt the ideas presented here to deliver additional mathematical functions at high throughput.","doi":"10.1147/rd.492.0465","publicationTitle":"IBM Journal of Research and Development","displayPublicationTitle":"IBM Journal of Research and Development","pdfPath":"/iel5/5288520/5388783/05388793.pdf","startPage":"465","endPage":"474","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1147/rd.492.0465","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5388783","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Custom math functions for molecular dynamics","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5388793","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IBM","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  2005","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5388793/","displayDocTitle":"Custom math functions for molecular dynamics","volume":"49","issue":"2.3","publicationDate":"March 2005","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 April 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Custom math functions for molecular dynamics","sourcePdf":"enenkel.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.040144S","chronDate":"March  2005","isNumber":"5388783","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5288520","citationCount":"1","articleId":"5388793","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IBM","lastupdate":"2021-09-28"},{"_id":5388794,"authors":[{"name":"A.

As optical technology improves and link frequencies continue to increase, optical links will be increasingly considered for shorter, higher-bandwidth links such as I/O, memory, and system bus links. For these links closer to processors, issues such as packaging, power dissipation, and components cost assume increasing importance along with link bandwidth and link distance. Also, as optical links move steadily closer to the processors, we may see significant differences in how servers, particularly high-end servers, are designed and packaged to exploit the unique characteristics of optical interconnects. This paper reviews the various levels of a server interconnect hierarchy and the current status of optical interconnect technology for these different levels.

These processes differ significantly in complexity and commensurate cost. Recently, a new bumping process developed at IBM Research called injection-molded solder, or IMS, has shown the capability to combine low-cost attributes with high-end capabilities. The development of IMS technology was driven by the need to reduce wafer-bumping costs while simultaneously addressing the conflicting needs of increasing wafer dimensions to 300 mm, decreasing bump and pitch dimensions below 75 \u00b5m on 150-\u00b5m centers, and optimal Pb-free alloy selection and processing. This paper describes IMS technology for both standard eutectic SnPb and Pb-free wafer bumping.

Key technology enablers include silicon through-vias, high-density wiring, high-I/O chip interconnection, and supporting test and assembly technologies. The silicon through-vias are a key feature permitting efficient area array signal, power, and ground interconnection through these thinned silicon packages. High-density wiring and high-density chip I/O interconnection can enable tight integration of heterogeneous chip technologies which approximate the performance of an integrated system-on-chip with a \u201cvirtual chip\u201d using the silicon package for integration. Silicon carrier fabrication leverages existing manufacturing capability and mid-UV lithography to provide very dense package wiring following CMOS back-end-of-line design rules. Further, the thermal expansion of the silicon carrier package matches the chip, which helps maintain reliability even as the high-density chip microbump interconnections scale to smaller size. In addition to heterogeneous chip integration, SOP products may leverage the integration of passive components, active devices, and electro-optic structures to enhance system-level performance while also maintaining functional test capability and known good chips when needed. This paper describes the technical challenges and recent progress made in the development of silicon carrier technology for potential new applications.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Development of next-generation system-on-package (SOP) technology based on silicon carriers with fine-pitch chip interconnection","publicationTitle":"IBM Journal of Research and Development","doi":"10.1147/rd.494.0725","displayPublicationTitle":"IBM Journal of Research and Development","pdfPath":"/iel5/5288520/5388808/05388819.pdf","startPage":"725","endPage":"753","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1147/rd.494.0725","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5388808","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5388819","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IBM","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5388819/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"July  2005","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2005","displayDocTitle":"Development of next-generation system-on-package (SOP) technology based on silicon carriers with fine-pitch chip interconnection","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"49","issue":"4.5","dateOfInsertion":"06 April 2010","publicationDate":"July 2005","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Development of next-generation system-on-package (SOP) technology based on silicon carriers with fine-pitch chip interconnection","sourcePdf":"knickerbocker.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.063522S","chronDate":"July  2005","isNumber":"5388808","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5288520","citationCount":"114","articleId":"5388819","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IBM","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5388820,"authors":[{"name":"M.

We review the impact of Rent's work and present the memoranda in the context of IBM computer hardware development since the 1950s. Furthermore, because computer hardware components have changed significantly since the memoranda were written in 1960, a new interpretation is needed for today's ultra-large-scale integrated circuitry. On the basis of our analysis of the memoranda, one of the authors' personal knowledge of the 1401 and 1410 computers, and our experience in the design of high-performance circuitry for microprocessor chips, we have derived an historically equivalent interpretation of Rent's memoranda that is suitable for today's computer components.

Simultaneous multithreading (SMT), first available on the POWER5\u2122 processor, moves beyond simple thread switching to the maintenance of two thread streams that are issued as continuously as possible to ensure the maximum use of processor resources. Because SMT has the potential of increasing processor efficiency and correspondingly increasing the amount of work done for a given time span, the reader might suppose that SMT would exhibit a performance gain for all workloads. This is true for most workloads, but is not true in some exceptional cases. In SMT mode, the processor resources\u2014register sets, caches, queues, translation buffers, and the system memory nest\u2014must be shared by both threads, and conditions can occur that degrade or even obviate SMT performance improvement. The POWER4\u2122 and POWER5 processors have very powerful performance monitor (PM) toolsets that can help the user to determine what is occurring in workloads that may not be providing expected SMT gains. In this paper, the results of measured differences among workloads having large, medium, small, and even negative SMT performance gains are presented along with an approach to investigating workloads to determine the source of SMT performance gain limits.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Characterization of simultaneous multithreading (SMT) efficiency in POWER5","publicationTitle":"IBM Journal of Research and Development","doi":"10.1147/rd.494.0555","displayPublicationTitle":"IBM Journal of Research and Development","pdfPath":"/iel5/5288520/5388808/05388823.pdf","startPage":"555","endPage":"564","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1147/rd.494.0555","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5388808","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5388823","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IBM","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5388823/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"July  2005","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2005","displayDocTitle":"Characterization of simultaneous multithreading (SMT) efficiency in POWER5","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"49","issue":"4.5","dateOfInsertion":"06 April 2010","publicationDate":"July 2005","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Characterization of simultaneous multithreading (SMT) efficiency in POWER5","sourcePdf":"mathis.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.048581S","chronDate":"July  2005","isNumber":"5388808","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5288520","citationCount":"11","articleId":"5388823","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IBM","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5388827,"authors":[{"name":"B.

A POWER5 system allows both single-threaded and multithreaded execution modes. In single-threaded execution mode, a POWER5 system allows for higher performance than its predecessor POWER4 system at equivalent frequencies. In multithreaded execution mode, the POWER5 microprocessor implements dynamic resource balancing to ensure that each thread receives its fair share of system resources. Additionally, software-settable thread priority is enforced by the POWER5 hardware. To conserve power, the POWER5 chip implements dynamic power management that allows reduced power consumption without affecting performance.","displayPublicationTitle":"IBM Journal of Research and Development","pdfPath":"/iel5/5288520/5388808/05388827.pdf","startPage":"505","endPage":"521","publicationTitle":"IBM Journal of Research and Development","doi":"10.1147/rd.494.0505","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1147/rd.494.0505","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5388808","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5388827","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"POWER5 system microarchitecture","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IBM","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5388827/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2005","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"July  2005","displayDocTitle":"POWER5 system microarchitecture","volume":"49","issue":"4.5","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"July 2005","dateOfInsertion":"06 April 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"POWER5 system microarchitecture","sourcePdf":"sinharoy.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.019549S","chronDate":"July  2005","isNumber":"5388808","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5288520","citationCount":"100","articleId":"5388827","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IBM","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5388848,"authors":[{"name":"Z.

In this paper, we present a wireless-local-area-network-based (WLAN-based) indoor positioning technology. The wireless device deploys a position-determination model to gather location information from collected WLAN signals. A model-based signal distribution training scheme is proposed to trade off the accuracy of signal distribution and training workload. A tracking-assistant positioning algorithm is presented to employ knowledge of the area topology to assist the procedure of position determination. We have set up a positioning system at the IBM China Research Laboratory. Our experimental results indicate an accuracy of 2 m with a 90% probability for static devices and, for moving (walking) devices, an accuracy of 5 m with a 90% probability. Moreover, the complexity of the training procedure is greatly reduced compared with other positioning algorithms.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A wireless LAN-based indoor positioning technology","publicationTitle":"IBM Journal of Research and Development","doi":"10.1147/rd.485.0617","displayPublicationTitle":"IBM Journal of Research and Development","pdfPath":"/iel5/5288520/5388830/05388848.pdf","startPage":"617","endPage":"626","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1147/rd.485.0617","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5388830","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5388848","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IBM","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5388848/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep.  2004","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep.  2004","displayDocTitle":"A wireless LAN-based indoor positioning technology","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"48","issue":"5.6","dateOfInsertion":"06 April 2010","publicationDate":"Sep. 2004","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A wireless LAN-based indoor positioning technology","sourcePdf":"xiang.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.039701S","chronDate":"Sep.  2004","isNumber":"5388830","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5288520","citationCount":"85","articleId":"5388848","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"IBM","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5388855,"authors":[{"name":"R.

Since its introduction in the 1970s, the DRAM technology has been driven by cost while the logic technology has been driven by speed, leading to an ever-widening gap between slower memory and faster logic devices. That has led to the need for increasingly complex levels of memory hierarchies, resulting in considerable degradation of system performance despite many design and architecture compromises. DRAM can provide six to eight times as much memory as SRAM (static random access memory) in the same area, but has been too slow to be used at any cache level. Our studies, highlighted in this paper, indicated that the use of logic-based DRAM could resolve that difficulty\u2014and was necessary for integrating systems on a chip. This has led to the inclusion of logic-based eDRAM as a memory option in the IBM ASICs (application-specific integrated circuits) product.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IBM","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5388855/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  2005","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2005","volume":"49","issue":"1","dateOfInsertion":"06 April 2010","publicationDate":"Jan. 2005","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Logic-based eDRAM: Origins and rationale for use","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Logic-based eDRAM: Origins and rationale for use","sourcePdf":"matick.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.031866S","chronDate":"Jan.  2005","isNumber":"5388850","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5288520","citationCount":"29","articleId":"5388855","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IBM","lastupdate":"2021-09-28"},{"_id":5388859,"authors":[{"name":"L.

We also break down disk technology improvement into four basic effects\u2014faster seeks, higher RPM, linear density improvement, and increase in track density\u2014and analyze each separately to determine its actual benefit. In addition, we examine the historical rates of improvement and use the trends to project the effect of disk technology scaling. As part of this study, we develop a methodology for replaying real workloads that more accurately models I/O arrivals and that allows the I/O rate to be more realistically scaled than previously. We find that optimization techniques that reduce the number of physical I/Os are generally more effective than those that improve the efficiency in performing the I/Os. Sequential prefetching and write buffering are particularly effective, reducing the average read and write response time by about 50% and 90%, respectively. Our results suggest that a reliable method for improving performance is to use larger caches up to and even beyond 1% of the storage used. For a given workload, our analysis shows that disk technology improvement at the historical rate increases performance by about 8% per year if the disk occupancy rate is kept constant, and by about 15% per year if the same number of disks are used. We discover that the actual average seek time and rotational latency are, respectively, only about 35% and 60% of the specified values. We also observe that the disk head positioning time far dominates the data transfer time, suggesting that to effectively utilize the available disk bandwidth, data should be reorganized such that accesses become more sequential.","doi":"10.1147/rd.482.0255","publicationTitle":"IBM Journal of Research and Development","displayPublicationTitle":"IBM Journal of Research and Development","pdfPath":"/iel5/5288520/5388862/05388867.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1147/rd.482.0255","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5388862","startPage":"255","endPage":"289","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The performance impact of I/O optimizations and disk improvements","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5388867","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IBM","displayDocTitle":"The performance impact of I/O optimizations and disk improvements","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2004","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5388867/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  2004","isJournal":true,"volume":"48","issue":"2","publicationDate":"March 2004","dateOfInsertion":"06 April 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The performance impact of I/O optimizations and disk improvements","sourcePdf":"hsu.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.016015S","chronDate":"March  2004","isNumber":"5388862","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5288520","citationCount":"18","articleId":"5388867","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"IBM","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5388875,"authors":[{"name":"T.

Furthermore, it is programmable and highly flexible, so that its function can be easily modified to meet new requirements as they appear. These features are possible because of innovative design in both the hardware and embedded software for the card.

The key component of the toolset is a parameterized set of energy functions that can be used in conjunction with any given cycle-accurate microarchitectural simulator. The energy functions model the power consumption of primitive and hierarchically composed building blocks which are used in microarchitecture-level performance models. Examples of structures modeled are pipeline stage latches, queues, buffers and component read/write multiplexers, local clock buffers, register files, and cache array macros. The energy functions can be derived using purely analytical equations that are driven by organizational, circuit, and technology parameters or behavioral equations that are derived from empirical, circuit-level simulation experiments. After describing the modeling methodology, we present analysis results in the context of a current-generation superscalar processor simulator to illustrate the use and effectiveness of such early-stage models. In addition to average power and performance tradeoff analysis, PowerTimer is useful in assessing the typical and worst-case power (or current) swings that occur between successive cycle windows in a given workload execution.

System performance and the details of energy consumption for this class of servers, however, are not well understood. In this paper, we describe a research prototype designated as the Super Dense Server (SDS), which was optimized for high-density deployment. We describe its hardware features, show how they challenge the operating system and middleware, and describe how we have enhanced its software to handle these challenges. Our performance evaluation has shown that dense servers are a viable deployment alternative for the edge and application servers commonly found at conventional Web sites and large data centers. Using industry benchmarks, we have shown that SDS outperforms a comparable traditional server by almost a factor of 2 for CPU-bound electronic commerce workloads for the same space and roughly equivalent power budget. We have observed the same advantage in performance when SDS is compared to the alternative solution of virtualizing a high-end server to handle \u201cscaled-down\u201c workloads. We have also shown that SDS offers finer power management control than traditional servers, allowing higher energy efficiency per unit of computation. However, for high-intensity Web-serving workloads, SDS does not perform as well as a traditional server when many nodes must be configured into a cluster to provide a single system image. In that case, the limited memory of each SDS node reduces its performance scalability, and a traditional server is a better alternative. We have concluded that until technology advances allow denser packaging of memory or more efficient use of memory across nodes, the best performance and energy efficiency can be obtained by heterogeneous deployment of both traditional high-end and dense servers.","doi":"10.1147/rd.475.0671","displayPublicationTitle":"IBM Journal of Research and Development","pdfPath":"/iel5/5288520/5388899/05388903.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1147/rd.475.0671","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5388899","publicationTitle":"IBM Journal of Research and Development","startPage":"671","endPage":"688","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IBM","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  2003","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"On the performance and use of dense servers","volume":"47","issue":"5.6","dateOfInsertion":"06 April 2010","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2003","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5388903/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2003","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the performance and use of dense servers","sourcePdf":"felter.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.03566S","chronDate":"Sept.  2003","isNumber":"5388899","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5288520","citationCount":"8","articleId":"5388903","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2003","subType":"IBM","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":5388905,"authors":[{"name":"R.

Second, developments in conventional RAM cells and emerging cells, such as DRAM gain cells and leakage-immune SRAM cells, are discussed from the viewpoints of cell area, operating voltage, and leakage currents of MOSFETs. Third, the concepts proposed to date to reduce subthreshold current and the advantages of RAMs with respect to reducing the subthreshold current are summarized, including their applications to RAM circuits to reduce the current in standby and active modes, exemplified by DRAMs. After this, design issues in other peripheral circuits, such as sense amplifiers and low-voltage supporting circuits, are discussed, as are power management to suppress speed variations and reduce the power of power-aware systems, and testing. Finally, future prospects based on the above discussion are examined.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IBM","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5388907/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  2003","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2003","publicationDate":"Sept. 2003","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 April 2010","volume":"47","issue":"5.6","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Review and future prospects of low-voltage RAM circuits","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Review and future prospects of low-voltage RAM circuits","sourcePdf":"nakagome.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.016376S","chronDate":"Sept.  2003","isNumber":"5388899","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5288520","citationCount":"67","articleId":"5388907","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2003","subType":"IBM","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5388909,"authors":[{"name":"V.

Analyzing data for actual designs, we show how to measure the introduced parameters and discuss variations between observed results and common theoretical assumptions. For a power-efficient design, we derive relations for \u03b7 and supply voltage V under progressively more general situations and illustrate the use of these equations in simple examples. Then we establish a relation between the architectural energy-efficiency metric and hardware intensity, and we derive expressions for evaluating the effect of modifications at the microarchitectural level on processor frequency and power, assuming the optimal tuning of the pipeline. These relations will guide the architect to achieve an energy-optimal balance between architectural complexity and hardware intensity.","publicationTitle":"IBM Journal of Research and Development","displayPublicationTitle":"IBM Journal of Research and Development","pdfPath":"/iel5/5288520/5388899/05388915.pdf","startPage":"585","endPage":"598","doi":"10.1147/rd.475.0585","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1147/rd.475.0585","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5388899","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Balancing hardware intensity in microprocessor pipelines","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IBM","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5388915/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  2003","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2003","displayDocTitle":"Balancing hardware intensity in microprocessor pipelines","publicationDate":"Sept. 2003","dateOfInsertion":"06 April 2010","isJournal":true,"volume":"47","issue":"5.6","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Balancing hardware intensity in microprocessor pipelines","sourcePdf":"zyuban.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.012214S","chronDate":"Sept.  2003","isNumber":"5388899","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5288520","citationCount":"19","articleId":"5388915","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2003","subType":"IBM","lastupdate":"2021-09-28"},{"_id":5388938,"authors":[{"name":"D.

Complex rf- and mixed-signal system-on-chip designs require accurate prediction early in the design schedule, and time-to-market pressures dictate that design iterations be kept to a minimum. Signal integrity is seen as a key issue in typical applications, requiring very accurate interconnect transmission-line modeling and RLC extraction of parasitic effects. To enable this, IBM has in place a mature project infrastructure consisting of predictive device models, complete rf characterization, statistical and scalable compact models that are hardware-verified, and a robust design automation environment. Finally, the unit and integration testing of all of these components is performed thoroughly. This paper describes each of these aspects and provides an overview of associated development work.","doi":"10.1147/rd.472.0139","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1147/rd.472.0139","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5388931","startPage":"139","endPage":"175","displayPublicationTitle":"IBM Journal of Research and Development","pdfPath":"/iel5/5288520/5388931/05388939.pdf","publicationTitle":"IBM Journal of Research and Development","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5388939","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IBM","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Design automation methodology and rf/analog modeling for rf CMOS and SiGe BiCMOS technologies","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2003","isJournal":true,"volume":"47","issue":"2.3","publicationDate":"March 2003","dateOfInsertion":"06 April 2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  2003","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5388939/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design automation methodology and rf/analog modeling for rf CMOS and SiGe BiCMOS technologies","sourcePdf":"harame.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.035774S","chronDate":"March  2003","isNumber":"5388931","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5288520","citationCount":"2","articleId":"5388939","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2003","subType":"IBM","lastupdate":"2022-01-10"},{"_id":5388940,"authors":[{"name":"S.

The semiconductor processor chips must be supported and protected in a mechanical structure that has to provide electrical interconnects while maintaining the chip junction temperature within specified limits. The mechanical structure should be able to withstand shock and vibrations during transportation or events such as earthquakes. The processor chips require electrical power at well-regulated voltages, unaffected by the ac-line voltage and load current fluctuations. The acoustical and electromagnetic noise produced by the hardware must be within the limits set by national regulatory agencies, and the electronic operations must be adequately protected from disruption caused by electromagnetic radiation. For high availability, the power, packaging, and cooling hardware must have redundancy and the ability to be maintained while the system is operating. This paper first overviews the packaging hardware, followed by a description of the first- and second-level packaging, which includes the mother board and the multichip module. Thermal management is discussed from the point of view of both the multichip module and the overall system. Power conversion, management, and distribution are presented next. Finally, the design aspects involved with meeting the requirements of electromagnetic compatibility, acoustics, and immunity to shock, vibration, and earthquakes are discussed.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IBM","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5388973/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov.  2002","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","publicationDate":"Nov. 2002","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 April 2010","volume":"46","issue":"6","displayDocTitle":"A power, packaging, and cooling overview of the IBM eServer z900","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A power, packaging, and cooling overview of the IBM eServer z900","sourcePdf":"singh.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.022933S","chronDate":"Nov.  2002","isNumber":"5388961","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5288520","citationCount":"6","articleId":"5388973","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IBM","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5388990,"authors":[{"name":"J.

In recent years, multilevel interconnect networks have become the primary limit on the productivity, performance, energy dissipation, and signal integrity of gigascale integration. Consequently, a broad spectrum of novel solutions to the multifaceted interconnect problem must be explored. Here we review recent salient results of this exploration. Based upon prediction of the complete stochastic signal interconnect length distribution of a megacell, optimal reverse scaling of each pair of wiring levels provides a prime opportunity to minimize cell area, clock period, power dissipation, or number of wiring levels. Using a heterogeneous version of Rent's rule, a design methodology for the global signal, clock, and power/ground distribution networks for a system-on-a-chip has been derived. Wiring area, bandwidth, and signal integrity are the prime constraints on the design of the networks. Three-dimensional integration offers the opportunity to reduce the length of the longest global interconnects in a distribution by as much as 75%. Wafer-level batch fabrication of chip input/output interconnects and chip scale packages provides new benefits such as I/O bandwidth enhancement, simultaneous switching-noise reduction, and lower cost of packaging and testing. Microphotonic interconnects have long-term potential to reduce latency, power dissipation, and crosstalk while increasing bandwidth.","doi":"10.1147/rd.462.0245","publicationTitle":"IBM Journal of Research and Development","displayPublicationTitle":"IBM Journal of Research and Development","pdfPath":"/iel5/5288520/5388985/05388992.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1147/rd.462.0245","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5388985","startPage":"245","endPage":"263","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Interconnect opportunities for gigascale integration","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5388992","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IBM","displayDocTitle":"Interconnect opportunities for gigascale integration","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5388992/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  2002","isJournal":true,"volume":"46","issue":"2.3","publicationDate":"March 2002","dateOfInsertion":"06 April 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Interconnect opportunities for gigascale integration","sourcePdf":"meindl.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.028842S","chronDate":"March  2002","isNumber":"5388985","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5288520","citationCount":"57","articleId":"5388992","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IBM","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5388995,"authors":[{"name":"E.

The fundamental limiting factors are electron thermal energy, tunneling leakage through gate oxide, and 2D electrostatic scale length. Both the standby power and the active power of a processor chip will increase precipitously below the 0.1-\u00b5m or 100-nm technology generation. To extend CMOS scaling to the shortest channel length possible while still gaining significant performance benefit, an optimized, vertically and laterally nonuniform doping design (superhalo) is presented. It is projected that room-temperature CMOS will be scaled to 20-nm channel length with the superhalo profile. Low-temperature CMOS allows additional design space to further extend CMOS scaling to near 10 nm.","doi":"10.1147/rd.462.0213","publicationTitle":"IBM Journal of Research and Development","displayPublicationTitle":"IBM Journal of Research and Development","pdfPath":"/iel5/5288520/5388985/05389000.pdf","startPage":"213","endPage":"222","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1147/rd.462.0213","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5388985","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"CMOS design near the limit of scaling","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IBM","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5389000/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  2002","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2002","displayDocTitle":"CMOS design near the limit of scaling","volume":"46","issue":"2.3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 2002","dateOfInsertion":"06 April 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"CMOS design near the limit of scaling","sourcePdf":"taur.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.016547S","chronDate":"March  2002","isNumber":"5388985","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5288520","citationCount":"112","articleId":"5389000","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IBM","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5389001,"authors":[{"name":"H.-S.

The architecture they implemented lacked 64-bit addressability and had only a limited set of 64-bit arithmetic instructions. The processors also lacked data and instruction bandwidth, since they utilized a unified cache. The branch performance was good, but there were delays due to conflicts in searching and writing the branch target buffer. Also, the hardware data compression and decimal arithmetic performance, though good, was in demand by database and COBOL programmers. Most of the performance concerns regarding prior processors were due to area constraints. Recent technology advances have increased the circuit density by 50 percent over that of the G6 processor. This has allowed the design of several performance-critical areas to be revisited. The end result of these efforts is the IBM eServer z900 processor, which is the first high-end processor based on the new 64-bit z/Architecture\u2122.","displayPublicationTitle":"IBM Journal of Research and Development","pdfPath":"/iel5/5288520/5389003/05389020.pdf","startPage":"381","endPage":"395","publicationTitle":"IBM Journal of Research and Development","doi":"10.1147/rd.464.0381","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1147/rd.464.0381","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5389003","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5389020","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The microarchitecture of the IBM eServer z900 processor","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IBM","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5389020/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2002","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"July  2002","displayDocTitle":"The microarchitecture of the IBM eServer z900 processor","volume":"46","issue":"4.5","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"July 2002","dateOfInsertion":"06 April 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The microarchitecture of the IBM eServer z900 processor","sourcePdf":"schwarz.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.021856S","chronDate":"July  2002","isNumber":"5389003","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5288520","citationCount":"8","articleId":"5389020","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IBM","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5389044,"authors":[{"name":"J.

Designing a combinatorial library is a controversial art that involves a heterogeneous mix of chemistry, mathematics, economics, experience, and intuition. Although there seems to be little agreement as to what constitutes an ideal library, one thing is certain: Only one property or measure seldom defines the quality of the design. In most real-world applications, a good experiment requires the simultaneous optimization of several, often conflicting, design objectives, some of which may be vague and uncertain. In this paper, we discuss a class of algorithms for subset selection rooted in the principles of multiobjective optimization. Our approach is to employ an objective function that encodes all of the desired selection criteria, and then use a simulated annealing or evolutionary approach to identify the optimal (or a nearly optimal) subset from among the vast number of pos sibilities. Many design criteria can be accommodated, including diversity, similarity to known actives, predicted activity and/or selectivity determined by quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models or receptor binding models, enforcement of certain property distributions, reagent cost and availability, and many others. The method is robust, convergent, and extensible, offers the user full control over the relative significance of the various objectives in the final design, and permits the simultaneous selection of compounds from multiple libraries in full- or sparse-array format.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IBM","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5389047/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May  2001","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2001","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","publicationDate":"May 2001","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 April 2010","volume":"45","issue":"3.4","displayDocTitle":"Multiobjective optimization of combinatorial libraries","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multiobjective optimization of combinatorial libraries","sourcePdf":"agrafiotis.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.025889S","chronDate":"May  2001","isNumber":"5389046","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5288520","citationCount":"2","articleId":"5389047","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2001","subType":"IBM","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5389051,"authors":[{"name":"E.

This is an attempt to enhance the accuracy of classical printing to a precision comparable with optical lithography, creating a low-cost, large-area, high-resolution patterning process. First, we introduce the components of this technique, called soft lithography, and review its evolution. Topics described in detail are the stamp material, stamp architecture, pattern design rules, and printing tools. The accuracy of the prints made by thin patterned elastomeric layers supported on a stiff and flexible backplane is then assessed, and defects are characterized using a new electrical metrology approach. This is followed by a discussion of various printing processes used in our laboratory: 1) thiol printing for high-resolution patterns of noble metals that may also be used as sacrificial masks; 2) confined contact processing with liquids in cavities or cha nnels to chemically convert a substrate or deposit layers of materials or biomolecules; 3) printing of catalysts to mediate patterned deposition of metals; and 4) structured, light-guiding stamps for transferring high-resolution patterns into photoresists. Finally, we compare classical and high-resolution printing approaches, and describe their potential for emerging micro- and nano-scale patterning technologies.","doi":"10.1147/rd.455.0697","publicationTitle":"IBM Journal of Research and Development","displayPublicationTitle":"IBM Journal of Research and Development","pdfPath":"/iel5/5288520/5389064/05389071.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1147/rd.455.0697","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5389064","startPage":"697","endPage":"719","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Printing meets lithography: Soft approaches to high-resolution patterning","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5389071","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IBM","displayDocTitle":"Printing meets lithography: Soft approaches to high-resolution patterning","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep.  2001","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5389071/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep.  2001","isJournal":true,"volume":"45","issue":"5","publicationDate":"Sep. 2001","dateOfInsertion":"06 April 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Printing meets lithography: Soft approaches to high-resolution patterning","sourcePdf":"michel.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.033045S","chronDate":"Sep.  2001","isNumber":"5389064","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5288520","citationCount":"19","articleId":"5389071","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2001","subType":"IBM","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5389079,"authors":[{"name":"C.

High-temperature solution-phase synthesis (100\u2013300\u00b0C) is followed by size-selective separation techniques in the preparation of monodisperse NC samples tunable in size from \u223c1 to 15 nm in diameter with <5% standard deviation. Each NC consists of a crystalline inorganic core coordinated by an organic monolayer. These monodisperse NC samples enable systematic studies of structural, electronic, magnetic, and optical properties of materials as a function of size evolution from molecular species (<100 atoms) to bulk solids (>100 000 atoms). We illustrate size-dependent properties for magnetic materials using Co and for semiconducting materials using PbSe. These NC samples are sufficiently uniform in size to self-assemble into close-packed, ordered NC superlattices, also known as colloidal crystals.","doi":"10.1147/rd.451.0047","publicationTitle":"IBM Journal of Research and Development","displayPublicationTitle":"IBM Journal of Research and Development","pdfPath":"/iel5/5288520/5389075/05389082.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1147/rd.451.0047","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5389075","startPage":"47","endPage":"56","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Colloidal synthesis of nanocrystals and nanocrystal superlattices","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5389082","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IBM","displayDocTitle":"Colloidal synthesis of nanocrystals and nanocrystal superlattices","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2001","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5389082/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  2001","isJournal":true,"volume":"45","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2001","dateOfInsertion":"06 April 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Colloidal synthesis of nanocrystals and nanocrystal superlattices","sourcePdf":"murray.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.025491S","chronDate":"Jan.  2001","isNumber":"5389075","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5288520","citationCount":"29","articleId":"5389082","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2001","subType":"IBM","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5389090,"authors":[{"name":"V.

Several studies and much anecdotal evidence point to \u201csoftware aging\u201d as a common phenomenon, in which the state of a software system degrades with time. Exhaustion of system resources, data corruption, and numerical error accumulation are the primary symptoms of this degradation, which may eventually lead to performance degradation of the software, crash/hang failure, or other undesirable effects. \u201cSoftware rejuvenation\u201d is a proactive technique intended to reduce the probability of future unplanned outages due to aging. The basic idea is to pause or halt the running software, refresh its internal state, and resume or restart it. Software rejuvenation can be performed by relying on a variety of indicators of aging, or on the time elapsed since the last rejuvenation. In response to the strong desire of customers to be provided with advance notice of unplanned outages, our group has developed techniques that dete ct the occurrence of software aging due to resource exhaustion, estimate the time remaining until the exhaustion reaches a critical level, and automatically perform proactive software rejuvenation of an application, process group, or entire operating system, depending on the pervasiveness of the resource exhaustion and our ability to pinpoint the source. This technology has been incorporated into the IBM Director for xSeries servers. To quantitatively evaluate the impact of different rejuvenation policies on the availability of cluster systems, we have developed analytical models based on stochastic reward nets (SRNs). For time-based rejuvenation policies, we determined the optimal rejuvenation interval based on system availability and cost. We also analyzed a rejuvenation policy based on prediction, and showed that it can further increase system availability and reduce downtime cost. These models are very general and can capture a multitude of cluster system characteristics, failure behavior, and performabil ity measures, which we are just beginning to explore.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IBM","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  2001","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5389090/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2001","volume":"45","issue":"2","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 2001","dateOfInsertion":"06 April 2010","displayDocTitle":"Proactive management of software aging","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Proactive management of software aging","sourcePdf":"castelli.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.02453S","chronDate":"March  2001","isNumber":"5389087","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5288520","citationCount":"115","articleId":"5389090","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2001","subType":"IBM","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":5389099,"authors":[{"name":"R.

The goal of this paradigm is to reduce interprocessor communication, and relax the synchronization requirements for such applications. We present the block data parallel architecture which implements this paradigm, and we present methods for mapping algorithms onto this architecture. We illustrate this methodology for several applications including twodimensional (2-D) digital filters, the 2-D discrete cosine transform, QR decomposition of a matrix, and Cholesky factorization of a matrix. We analyze the resulting system performance for these applications with regard to speedup and efficiency as the number of processors increases.

Commercial server workloads are shown to have unique characteristics which expand the elements that must be optimized to achieve good performance and require a unique performance methodology. The steps in the process of server performance optimization are described and include the following: 1. Selection of representative commercial workloads and identification of key characteristics to be evaluated. 2. Collection of performance data. Various instrumentation techniques are discussed in light of the requirements placed by commercial server workloads on the instrumentation. 3. Creation of input data for performance models on the basis of measured workload information. This step in the methodology must overcome the operating environment differences between the instance of the measured system under test and the target system design to be modeled . 4. Creation of performance models. Two general types are described: high-level models and detailed cycle-accurate simulators. These types are applied to model the processor, memory, and I/O system. 5. System performance optimization. The tuning of the operating system and application software is described. Optimization of performance among commercial applications is not simply an exercise in using traces to maximize the processor MIPS. Equally significant are items such as the use of probabilities to reflect future workload characteristics, software tuning, cache miss rate optimization, memory management, and I/O performance. The paper presents techniques for evaluating the performance of each of these key contributors so as to optimize the overall performance and cost/performance of commercial servers.","doi":"10.1147/rd.446.0851","startPage":"851","publicationTitle":"IBM Journal of Research and Development","displayPublicationTitle":"IBM Journal of Research and Development","pdfPath":"/iel5/5288520/5389114/05389120.pdf","endPage":"872","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5389114","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1147/rd.446.0851","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IBM","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov.  2000","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2000","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5389120/","displayDocTitle":"A performance methodology for commercial servers","volume":"44","issue":"6","dateOfInsertion":"06 April 2010","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2000","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A performance methodology for commercial servers","sourcePdf":"kunkel.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.032842S","chronDate":"Nov.  2000","isNumber":"5389114","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5288520","citationCount":"19","articleId":"5389120","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IBM","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":5389136,"authors":[{"name":"D.

It is concluded that the first problem will arise from the storage medium, whose grain size cannot be scaled much below a diameter of ten nanometers without thermal self-erasure. Other problems will involve head-to-disk spacings that approach atomic dimensions, and switching-speed limitations in the head and medium. It is likely that the rate of progress in areal density will decrease substantially as we develop drives with ten to a hundred times current areal densities. Beyond that, the future of magnetic storage technology is unclear. However, there are no alternative technologies which show promise for replacing hard disk storage in the next ten years.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IBM","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5389136/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2000","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May  2000","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"44","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May 2000","dateOfInsertion":"06 April 2010","displayDocTitle":"The future of magnetic data storage techology","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The future of magnetic data storage techology","sourcePdf":"thompson.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.013458S","chronDate":"May  2000","isNumber":"5389127","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5288520","citationCount":"28","articleId":"5389136","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IBM","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5389137,"authors":[{"name":"P.

Early TCM-technology mainframes delivered excellent data integrity, instantaneous error detection, and positive fault isolation, but had limited on-line repair. Later TCM mainframes introduced capabilities for providing a high degree of transparent recovery, failure masking, and on-line repair. New challenges accompanied the introduction of CMOS technology. A significant reduction in parts count greatly improved intrinsic failure rates, but dense packaging disallowed on-line CPU repair. In addition, characteristics of the microprocessor technology posed difficulties for traditional in-line error checking. As a result, system fault-tolerant design, particularly in CPUs and memory, underwent another evolution from G1 to G5. G5 implements an innovative design for a high-performance, fault-tolerant single-chip microprocessor. Dynamic CPU sparing delivers a transparent concurrent repair mechanism. A new internal channel provides a high-performance, highly available Parallel Sysplex\u00ae in a single mainframe. G5 is both the culmination of decades of innovation and careful implementation, and the highest achievement of S/390 fault-tolerant design.","doi":"10.1147/rd.435.0863","publicationTitle":"IBM Journal of Research and Development","displayPublicationTitle":"IBM Journal of Research and Development","pdfPath":"/iel5/5288520/5389153/05389172.pdf","startPage":"863","endPage":"873","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5389153","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1147/rd.435.0863","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5389172","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"IBM S/390 Parallel Enterprise Server G5 fault tolerance: A historical perspective","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IBM","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5389172/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  1999","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  1999","displayDocTitle":"IBM S/390 Parallel Enterprise Server G5 fault tolerance: A historical perspective","volume":"43","issue":"5.6","dateOfInsertion":"06 April 2010","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 1999","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"IBM S/390 Parallel Enterprise Server G5 fault tolerance: A historical perspective","sourcePdf":"spainhower.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.071736S","chronDate":"Sept.  1999","isNumber":"5389153","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5288520","citationCount":"74","articleId":"5389172","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IBM","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5389185,"authors":[{"name":"D.

This paper describes progress made in the preparation of BSTO films by liquid-source metal-organic chemical vapor deposition (LS-MOCVD) and the issues related to integrating films of BSTO into a DRAM capacitor. Films of BSTO deposited on planar Pt electrodes meet the electrical requirements needed for future DRAM. The specific capacitance and charge loss are found to be strongly dependent on the details of the BSTO deposition, the choice of the lower electrode structure, the microstructure of the BSTO, the post-electrode thermal treatments, BSTO dopants, and thin-film stress. Films of BSTO deposited on patterned Pt electrodes with a feature size of 0.2 \u00b5m are found to have degraded properties compared to films on large planar structures, but functional bits have been achieved on a DRAM test site at 0.20-\u00b5m ground rules. Mechanisms influencing specific capacitance and charge loss of BSTO films are described, as are therequirements for the electrode and barrier materials used in stacked-capacitor structures, with emphasis given to the properties of the Pt/TaSi(N) electrode/barrier system. Major problems requiring additional investigation are outlined.","doi":"10.1147/rd.433.0367","publicationTitle":"IBM Journal of Research and Development","displayPublicationTitle":"IBM Journal of Research and Development","pdfPath":"/iel5/5288520/5389206/05389214.pdf","startPage":"367","endPage":"382","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1147/rd.433.0367","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5389206","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5389214","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"(Ba,Sr)TiO<inf>3</inf> dielectrics for future stacked- capacitor DRAM","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IBM","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  1999","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May  1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5389214/","displayDocTitle":"(Ba,Sr)TiO<inf>3</inf> dielectrics for future stacked- capacitor DRAM","volume":"43","issue":"3","publicationDate":"May 1999","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 April 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"(Ba,Sr)TiO<inf>3</inf> dielectrics for future stacked- capacitor DRAM","sourcePdf":"kotecki.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.027789S","chronDate":"May  1999","isNumber":"5389206","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5288520","citationCount":"11","articleId":"5389214","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IBM","lastupdate":"2021-09-28"},{"_id":5389240,"authors":[{"name":"D.

The distinctions between lossy and lossless compression and static and adaptive compression techniques are first reviewed. Then, two main classes of adaptive Lempel-Ziv algorithm, now known as LZ1 and LZ2, are introduced. An outline of early work comparing these two types of algorithm is presented, together with some fundamental distinctions which led to the choice and development of an IBM variant of the LZ1 algorithm, ALDC , and its implementation in hardware. The encoding format for ALDC is presented, together with details of IBM's current fast hardware CMOS compression engine designs, based on use of a content-addressable memory (CAM) array. Overall compression results are compared for ALDC and a number of other algorithms, using the CALGARY data compression benchmark file corpus. More recently, work using small hardware preprocessors to enhance the compression of ALDC on other types of data has shown promising results. Two such algorithmic extensions, BLDC and cLDC , are presented, with the results obtained on important data types for which significant improvement over ALDC alone is achieved.","doi":"10.1147/rd.426.0733","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5389234","startPage":"733","endPage":"746","pdfPath":"/iel5/5288520/5389234/05389240.pdf","publicationTitle":"IBM Journal of Research and Development","displayPublicationTitle":"IBM Journal of Research and Development","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1147/rd.426.0733","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A fast hardware data compression algorithm and some algorithmic extensions","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IBM","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  1998","displayDocTitle":"A fast hardware data compression algorithm and some algorithmic extensions","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5389240/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov.  1998","dateOfInsertion":"06 April 2010","volume":"42","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 1998","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A fast hardware data compression algorithm and some algorithmic extensions","sourcePdf":"craft.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.011709S","chronDate":"Nov.  1998","isNumber":"5389234","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5288520","citationCount":"17","articleId":"5389240","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IBM","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":5389245,"authors":[{"name":"M.

CRC checking and generation are generally carried out on a per-byte basis, in an attempt to cope with the dramatic increase of the data throughput of higher-speed lines. More calculations are needed to process a new incoming byte of data if the number of terms of the polynomial is large, because more bits of the current intermediate result must be combined to calculate each bit of the next one. This tends to counteract the intrinsic speed advantage of the per-byte computation by requiring that more processing be done at each cycle. This paper describes a method that overrides the intrinsic complexity of the CRC-32 computation. It permits expediting AAL5 messages, which must be segmented into ATM cells, with CRC-32 computed at one end, and reassembled from cells, with CRC-32 checked for data integrity at the destination. The calculation is in two steps: 1) A first division is done on the entire message (until the last cell is received or segmented) by a much simpler polynomial. 2) A second division, on the remainder of the first division by the regular CRC-32 polynomial, is performed only once, in order to obtain the final result.","doi":"10.1147/rd.416.0705","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5389348","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1147/rd.416.0705","publicationTitle":"IBM Journal of Research and Development","displayPublicationTitle":"IBM Journal of Research and Development","pdfPath":"/iel5/5288520/5389348/05389352.pdf","startPage":"705","endPage":"709","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A two-step computation of cyclic redundancy code CRC-32 for ATM networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IBM","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov.  1997","displayDocTitle":"A two-step computation of cyclic redundancy code CRC-32 for ATM networks","volume":"41","issue":"6","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 April 2010","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5389352/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A two-step computation of cyclic redundancy code CRC-32 for ATM networks","sourcePdf":"glaise.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.013529S","chronDate":"Nov.  1997","isNumber":"5389348","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5288520","citationCount":"20","articleId":"5389352","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IBM","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":5389353,"authors":[{"name":"F.

Recursion leads to automatic variable blocking. LAPACK's level-2 versions transform into level-3 codes by using recursion. The new recursive codes are written in FORTRAN 77, which does not support recursion as a language feature. Gaussian elimination with partial pivoting and Cholesky factorization are considered. Very clear algorithms emerge with the use of recursion. The recursive codes do exactly the same computation as the LAPACK codes, and a single recursive code replaces both the level-2 and level-3 versions of the corresponding LAPACK codes. We present an analysis of the recursive algorithm in terms of both FLOP count and storage usage. The matrix operands are more \u201csquarish\u201d using recursion. The total area of the submatrices used in the recursive algorithm is less than the total area used by the LAPACK level-3 right-/left-looking algorithms. We quantify the difference; we also quantify how the FLOPS are computed. Also, we show that the algorithms exhibit high-performance on RISC-type processors. In fact, except for small matrices, the recursive version outperforms the level-3 LAPACK versions of DGETRF and DPOTRF on an RS/6000\u2122 workstation. For the level-2 versions, the performance gain approaches a factor of 3. We also demonstrate that a change to the LAPACK DLASWP routine can improve the performance of both the recursive version and DGETRF by more than 15 percent.","doi":"10.1147/rd.416.0737","publicationTitle":"IBM Journal of Research and Development","displayPublicationTitle":"IBM Journal of Research and Development","pdfPath":"/iel5/5288520/5389348/05389353.pdf","startPage":"737","endPage":"755","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1147/rd.416.0737","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5389348","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Recursion leads to automatic variable blocking for dense linear-algebra algorithms","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5389353","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IBM","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov.  1997","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5389353/","displayDocTitle":"Recursion leads to automatic variable blocking for dense linear-algebra algorithms","volume":"41","issue":"6","publicationDate":"Nov. 1997","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 April 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Recursion leads to automatic variable blocking for dense linear-algebra algorithms","sourcePdf":"gustavson.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.011406S","chronDate":"Nov.  1997","isNumber":"5389348","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5288520","citationCount":"29","articleId":"5389353","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IBM","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5389359,"authors":[{"name":"S.

We have simulated the instruction and data traffic resulting from 500 million instructions of each of the 18 programs. Simulation results show that only a few of the applications place more than modest demands on the memory system. This was noticed for instruction caches, where only a few workloads required more than a 32Kb cache to achieve miss rates of less than one miss every 1000 instructions. We also analyze two prefetching algorithms using the SPEC95 workload: next-sequential prefetching and shadow-directory prefetching. Each prefetching algorithm is evaluated using three performance metrics: coverage, accuracy, and traffic. Variations in each prefetching algorithm involve the use of a confirmation mechanism that receives feedback information about the quality of each prefetch. With confirmation, the prefetching algorithm is able to enhance the accuracy of prefetching decisions. The results show that shadow-directory prefetching averages miss coverage about ten percent higher than next-sequential prefetching when used in prefetching instructions (about 60 percent coverage for next-sequential prefetching versus 70 percent for shadow-directory prefetching). The prefetching accuracy for both algorithms is more than 90 percent when a confirmation mechanism is used. In general, data prefetching is shown to be less accurate and to provide less coverage than instruction prefetching. Shadow-directory prefetching averaged about a 40 percent miss coverage versus a 25 percent miss coverage for next-sequential prefetching. Prefetching accuracy is over 70 percent when confirmation is applied.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5389380","publicationTitle":"IBM Journal of Research and Development","displayPublicationTitle":"IBM Journal of Research and Development","pdfPath":"/iel5/5288520/5389380/05389382.pdf","doi":"10.1147/rd.413.0265","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1147/rd.413.0265","startPage":"265","endPage":"286","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Prefetching and memory system behavior of the SPEC95 benchmark suite","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IBM","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May  1997","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5389382/","displayDocTitle":"Prefetching and memory system behavior of the SPEC95 benchmark suite","isJournal":true,"volume":"41","issue":"3","dateOfInsertion":"06 April 2010","publicationDate":"May 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Prefetching and memory system behavior of the SPEC95 benchmark suite","sourcePdf":"charney.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.072347S","chronDate":"May  1997","isNumber":"5389380","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5288520","citationCount":"20","articleId":"5389382","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IBM","lastupdate":"2021-09-28"},{"_id":5389383,"authors":[{"name":"P.

This paper shows that cycles per instruction (CPI) is a simple dot product of event frequencies and event penalties, and that it is far more intuitive than its more popular cousin, instructions per cycle (IPC). CPI is separable into three components that account for the inherent work, the pipeline, and the memory hierarchy, respectively. Each of these components is a fixed upper limit, or \u201chard bound,\u201d for the superscalar equivalent components. In the last decade, the memory-hierarchy component has become the most dominant of the three components, and in the next decade, queueing at the memory data bus will become a very significant part of this. In a reaction to this trend, an evolution in bus protocols will ensue. This paper provides a general sketch of those protocols. An underlying theme in this paper is that power constraints have been a driving force in computer architecture since the first computers were built fifty years ago. In CMOS technology, power constraints will shape future microarchitecture in a positive and surprising way. Specifically, a resurgence of the RISC approach is expected in high-performance design which will cause the client and server microarchitectures to converge.","doi":"10.1147/rd.413.0215","publicationTitle":"IBM Journal of Research and Development","displayPublicationTitle":"IBM Journal of Research and Development","pdfPath":"/iel5/5288520/5389380/05389383.pdf","startPage":"215","endPage":"232","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1147/rd.413.0215","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5389380","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Understanding some simple processor-performance limits","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5389383","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IBM","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May  1997","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5389383/","displayDocTitle":"Understanding some simple processor-performance limits","volume":"41","issue":"3","publicationDate":"May 1997","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 April 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Understanding some simple processor-performance limits","sourcePdf":"emma.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.012579S","chronDate":"May  1997","isNumber":"5389380","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5288520","citationCount":"19","articleId":"5389383","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IBM","lastupdate":"2021-09-28"},{"_id":5389420,"authors":[{"name":"T.

Although these chips are designed by many different customers having various levels of test experience and all having tight deadlines, IBM ASICs have a reputation for their high quality. This quality is due in large part to the heavy focus on design for test (DFT) and the use of design automation to help ensure that customers' chips can be manufactured, tested, and diagnosed with minimal engineering effort. Prospective customers of IBM ASIC technologies find an explicit set of DFT methodologies to follow which provide a relatively painless, almost push-button approach to the generation of high-quality, \u201csign-off\u201d test vectors for their chips. This paper discusses the DFT methodologies used for IBM ASICs and the design automation support that enables designers to be so productive with these methodologies. Data are given for several recently processed chips, some designed outside IBM.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Test methodologies and design automation for IBM ASICs","publicationTitle":"IBM Journal of Research and Development","doi":"10.1147/rd.404.0461","displayPublicationTitle":"IBM Journal of Research and Development","pdfPath":"/iel5/5288520/5389419/05389424.pdf","startPage":"461","endPage":"474","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1147/rd.404.0461","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5389419","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5389424","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IBM","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5389424/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"July  1996","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  1996","displayDocTitle":"Test methodologies and design automation for IBM ASICs","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"40","issue":"4","dateOfInsertion":"06 April 2010","publicationDate":"July 1996","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Test methodologies and design automation for IBM ASICs","sourcePdf":"gillis.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.013701S","chronDate":"July  1996","isNumber":"5389419","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5288520","citationCount":"25","articleId":"5389424","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IBM","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5389430,"authors":[{"name":"L.

It relates IBM circuit design and modeling, chip manufacture with process variations, and chip testing for SER sensitivity. This vertical integration from design to final test and with feedback to design allows a complete picture of LSI sensitivity to cosmic rays. Since advanced computers are designed with LSI chips long before the chips have been fabricated, and the system architecture is fully formed before the first chips are functional, it is essential to establish the chip reliability as early as possible. This paper establishes techniques to test chips that are only partly functional (e.g., only 1Mb of a 16Mb memory may be working) and can establish chip soft-error upset rates before final chip manufacturing begins. Simple relationships derived from measurement of more than 80 different chips manufactured over 20 years allow total cosmic soft-error rate (SER) to be estimated after only limited testing. Comparisons between these accelerated test results and similar tests determined by \u201cfield testing\u201d (which may require a year or more of testing after manufacturing begins) show that our experimental techniques are accurate to a factor of 2.","doi":"10.1147/rd.401.0051","publicationTitle":"IBM Journal of Research and Development","displayPublicationTitle":"IBM Journal of Research and Development","pdfPath":"/iel5/5288520/5389431/05389434.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1147/rd.401.0051","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5389431","startPage":"51","endPage":"72","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Accelerated testing for cosmic soft-error rate","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5389434","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IBM","displayDocTitle":"Accelerated testing for cosmic soft-error rate","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  1996","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5389434/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  1996","isJournal":true,"volume":"40","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 1996","dateOfInsertion":"06 April 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Accelerated testing for cosmic soft-error rate","sourcePdf":"muhlfeld.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.025491S","chronDate":"Jan.  1996","isNumber":"5389431","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5288520","citationCount":"40","articleId":"5389434","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"IBM","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5389435,"authors":[{"name":"P.

Concepts such as funneling, event-by-event simulation, nuclear history files, critical charge, and charge sharing are examined. Also discussed are the relative importance of elastic and inelastic nuclear collisions, rare event statistics, and device vs. circuit simulations. The semi-empirical methodologies used in the aerospace community to arrive at SERs [also referred to as single-event upset (SEU) rates] in integrated circuit chips are reviewed.

The quantitative flux of neutrons can be estimated to within 3\u00d7, and the relative variation in neutron flux with latitude, altitude, diurnal time, earth's sidereal position, and solar cycle is known with even higher accuracy. The possibility of two particles of a cascade interacting with a single circuit to cause two simultaneous errors is discussed.

Dynamic sector allocation inevitably accumulates obsolete data on the SSF. This \u201cgarbage\u201d must be erased in order to secure free space on the SSF. The garbage collection mechanism is a free-space-management method performed as a background process in the SSF. These three mechanisms are closely related and work collaboratively to enable flash EEPROMs to perform well in spite of the serious inherent limitations of the devices. We simulated the behavior of several SSFs and observed that 30% of the storage area of the SSFs must be used as a work area in order to ensure an acceptably low rate of memory-erase operations. We also demonstrated that the lifetime of the SSF is long enough for use in most personal computers.

While STM-based methods have demonstrated spectacular areal densities dwarfing anything achievable with today's storage technologies, reliability and data rate issues present serious obstacles. These problems have led us to focus on techniques based on AFM and near-field optics. First, we have developed a thermomechanical writing scheme using an AFM tip. We have addressed many of the practical issues involved, including data rate. With custom low-mass cantilevers, we have demonstrated readback on real data with a data rate of 1.2 Mb/s. We have also pursued nontopographic storage techniques based on charge storage in nitride-oxide semiconductor structures and near-field optical storage. These techniques should be able to achieve densities comparable to those reached with the AFM scheme, with the added advantage that they are fast and reversible. Although it is not yet clear whether any of these probe-based approaches can ever be made practical, they do represent potential pathways to the higher densities that will be needed in the decades ahead.","displayPublicationTitle":"IBM Journal of Research and Development","pdfPath":"/iel5/5288520/5389462/05389468.pdf","startPage":"681","endPage":"699","publicationTitle":"IBM Journal of Research and Development","doi":"10.1147/rd.396.0681","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1147/rd.396.0681","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5389462","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5389468","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High-density data storage using proximal probe techniques","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IBM","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5389468/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  1995","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov.  1995","displayDocTitle":"High-density data storage using proximal probe techniques","volume":"39","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 April 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High-density data storage using proximal probe techniques","sourcePdf":"mamin.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.042576S","chronDate":"Nov.  1995","isNumber":"5389462","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5288520","citationCount":"29","articleId":"5389468","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IBM","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5389472,"authors":[{"name":"D.

However, the intrinsic properties of SPM instrumentation and tip/sample interactions allow a number of important parameters and their ultimate values to be estimated. Coping with and possibly surpassing established technologies will require massive parallelism of SPM-type recording heads, a condition that might be satisfied in an elegant manner by using SPM-type, circulating piezoelectric flexural actuators. Operation of an entire array of recording heads will require highly precise micromechanical manufacturing and/or sophisticated control mechanisms. The resulting tolerance requirement can be relaxed by choosing long-range SPM interactions (Coulomb forces, capacitance, near-field optics, etc.). Furthermore, the interaction must allow a high recording speed. The restriction to read-only storage can facilitate exploratory work; the writing process in this case might be replaced by replication, similar to the techniques used in the production of compact disks.","doi":"10.1147/rd.396.0701","startPage":"701","publicationTitle":"IBM Journal of Research and Development","displayPublicationTitle":"IBM Journal of Research and Development","pdfPath":"/iel5/5288520/5389462/05389472.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1147/rd.396.0701","endPage":"711","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5389462","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Some thoughts about scanning probe microscopy, micromechanics, and storage","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IBM","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5389472/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov.  1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  1995","displayDocTitle":"Some thoughts about scanning probe microscopy, micromechanics, and storage","volume":"39","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 April 2010","publicationDate":"Nov. 1995","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Some thoughts about scanning probe microscopy, micromechanics, and storage","sourcePdf":"pohl.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.028804S","chronDate":"Nov.  1995","isNumber":"5389462","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5288520","citationCount":"1","articleId":"5389472","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IBM","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5389497,"authors":[{"name":"A.

More powerful modeling styles, such as register-transfer and behavioral level specifications, have spurred the development of high-level synthesis techniques in both industry and academia. However, despite the many research efforts, the technology is not yet in widespread use in industry. This paper presents the IBM High-Level Synthesis System (HIS), which is the first such system to be used in production in IBM. HIS synthesizes gate-level networks from VHDL models at various levels of abstraction. The main algorithms, modeling capabilities, and methodology considerations in the HIS system are presented. Results show that HIS is capable of producing implementations comparable to or better than those of the existing methodology, while shortening the design time significantly. The HIS system is currently in production use and evaluation in several IBM sites for processors and peripheral chip designs, as well as being an external commercial product.","doi":"10.1147/rd.391.0131","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1147/rd.391.0131","publicationTitle":"IBM Journal of Research and Development","displayPublicationTitle":"IBM Journal of Research and Development","pdfPath":"/iel5/5288520/5389502/05389505.pdf","startPage":"131","endPage":"148","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5389502","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High-level synthesis in an industrial environment","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IBM","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5389505/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  1995","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  1995","displayDocTitle":"High-level synthesis in an industrial environment","volume":"39","issue":"1.2","dateOfInsertion":"06 April 2010","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 1995","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High-level synthesis in an industrial environment","sourcePdf":"bergamaschi.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.049127S","chronDate":"Jan.  1995","isNumber":"5389502","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5288520","citationCount":"14","articleId":"5389505","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IBM","lastupdate":"2021-09-28"},{"_id":5389514,"authors":[{"name":"D.

One means of achieving a low-cost optoelectronics link is to adapt volume-manufactured components. This may imply CMOS optoelectronic integrated circuits (OEICs), which are suggested by the huge CMOS IC volumes being produced for computer logic and memory, and red laser diodes, which are already in demand for the consumer and storage markets. In this paper, we demonstrate a potential low-cost link using a monolithically integrated Si photodiode and CMOS preamplifier, a multimode fiber-optic transmission medium, and red, vertical-cavity surface-emitting lasers (VCSELs). The integrated receiver shows a 3.5-dB improvement in received power when light at 670 nm instead of 845 nm is used; it operates error free at both the Fibre Channel rate of 531.25 Mb/s and the SONET OC-12 rate of 622.08 Mb/s. The red VCSELs are shown to be capable of a 1.5-Gb/s transmission data rate with as little as 18 mW average power dissipation.

The architectural features of the POWER2 machine that we describe and that lead to high performance are multiple functional units, high bandwidth between registers, cache, and memory, a large number of fixed- and floating-point registers, and a large cache and TLB (translation lookaside buffer). The paper gives two examples that illustrate how the algorithms and architectural features interplay to produce high-performance codes. They are BLAS (basic linear algebra subroutines) and narrow-band matrix routin es. These routines are included in ESSL (Engineering and Scientific Subroutine Library); an overview of ESSL is also given in this paper.","doi":"10.1147/rd.385.0563","publicationTitle":"IBM Journal of Research and Development","displayPublicationTitle":"IBM Journal of Research and Development","pdfPath":"/iel5/5288520/5389538/05389539.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1147/rd.385.0563","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5389538","startPage":"563","endPage":"576","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Exploiting functional parallelism of POWER2 to design high-performance numerical algorithms","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5389539","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IBM","displayDocTitle":"Exploiting functional parallelism of POWER2 to design high-performance numerical algorithms","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5389539/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  1994","isJournal":true,"volume":"38","issue":"5","publicationDate":"Sept. 1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 April 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Exploiting functional parallelism of POWER2 to design high-performance numerical algorithms","sourcePdf":"agarwal.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.013816S","chronDate":"Sept.  1994","isNumber":"5389538","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5288520","citationCount":"6","articleId":"5389539","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IBM","lastupdate":"2021-09-28"},{"_id":5389552,"authors":[{"name":"S.

The unit prefetches data from the cache by predicting the address of the data fetch in advance. This prefetch allows the cache access to take place early, in an otherwise unused cache cycle, eliminating one cycle from the load instruction. The prediction also allows the cache to prefetch data if they are not already in the cache. The cache-miss handling can be overlapped with other instruction execution. It is shown, using trace-driven simulations, that the proposed mechanism, when incorporated in a design, may contribute to a significant increase in processor performance.

The effects of photoelectrons, at one time thought to be problematic, are now understood not to limit resolution. With experiments and simulations via Maxwell\u2019s equations, we show that useful resolution is not limited by diffraction until linewidths are below 50 nm. It is critically important to optimize the source spatial incoherence to eliminate the deleterious effects of high spatial frequencies. Mask architecture and patterning methods are presented which we believe are compatible with manufacturing at linewidths from 500 to 30 nm. Distortion due to mask frame flexing and absorber stress can now be eliminated. Elimination of distortion at the pattern generation stage remains the problem of greatest concern. We discuss a proposed method of spatial-phase-locked electron-beam lithography which could solve this problem. Our new interferometric alignment scheme has achieved 18-nm alignment at 3\u03c3. We assert that projection XRL using multilayer mirrors at 13 nm can never match the present performance of proximity XRL. Applications of sub-100-nm XRL, including MOS, quantum-effect, and optoelectronic devices are discussed which illustrate the benefits of high resolution, process robustness, low distortion, low damage, and high throughput.","doi":"10.1147/rd.373.0319","publicationTitle":"IBM Journal of Research and Development","displayPublicationTitle":"IBM Journal of Research and Development","pdfPath":"/iel5/5288520/5389637/05389641.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1147/rd.373.0319","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5389637","startPage":"319","endPage":"329","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"X-ray lithography from 500 to 30 nm: X-ray nanolithography","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5389641","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IBM","displayDocTitle":"X-ray lithography from 500 to 30 nm: X-ray nanolithography","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  1993","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5389641/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May  1993","isJournal":true,"volume":"37","issue":"3","publicationDate":"May 1993","dateOfInsertion":"06 April 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"X-ray lithography from 500 to 30 nm: X-ray nanolithography","sourcePdf":"ibmrd3703E.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.017808S","chronDate":"May  1993","isNumber":"5389637","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5288520","citationCount":"4","articleId":"5389641","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IBM","lastupdate":"2021-09-28"},{"_id":5389662,"authors":[{"name":"H.

ESPER-2 is designed as a product-independent common servo writer which incorporates major advances in equipment cost, reduction of clean-room requirements, and writing accuracy. The servo writing process consists of two stages. The first stage writes the master servo pattern on as many as ten disks at once with little need for contaminant protection facilities. One such master disk is then assembled with other, raw, disks in a file, and the second stage writes the proper servo pattern on all disk surfaces by referring to the master. The effects of off-center discursions in the mechanical disk assembly and random runout (NRRO, or nonrepeatable runout) in the product spindle components are eliminated by table-lookup servo actuator control, so that writing accuracy is improved.

Given enough stress, the substrate will yield by generating dislocations. We examine the formation of stress-induced dislocations in integrated circuit structures. Examples are presented from bipolar and MOS-based integrated circuit structures that were created during developmental studies. The underlying causes of oxidation-induced stress and the effect on such stress of varying oxidation conditions are discussed. The knowledge thus gained is used to explain dislocation generation during the formation of a shallow-trench isolation structure. The importance of ion-implantation processes in nucleating dislocations is illustrated using structures formed by a deep-trench isolation process and a process used to form a trench capacitor in a DRAM cell. The effect of device layout geometry on dislocation generation is also examined. We show how TEM observations can be used to provide more information than solely identifying those process conditions under which dislocations are generated. By combining TEM observations with stress analysis, we show how the sources of stress responsible for dislocation movement can be identified.","doi":"10.1147/rd.362.0158","publicationTitle":"IBM Journal of Research and Development","displayPublicationTitle":"IBM Journal of Research and Development","pdfPath":"/iel5/5288520/5389701/05389704.pdf","startPage":"158","endPage":"182","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1147/rd.362.0158","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5389701","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Stress-induced dislocations in silicon integrated circuits","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IBM","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1992","displayDocTitle":"Stress-induced dislocations in silicon integrated circuits","volume":"36","issue":"2","dateOfInsertion":"06 April 2010","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 1992","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5389704/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1992","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Stress-induced dislocations in silicon integrated circuits","sourcePdf":"ibmrd3602D.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.041624S","chronDate":"March  1992","isNumber":"5389701","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5288520","citationCount":"20","articleId":"5389704","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IBM","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5389742,"authors":[{"name":"G.

A multiwindow environment allows different aspects of the simulation to be viewed simultaneously using real-time animations.

The key feature of the FPU is a unified floating-point multiply-add-fused unit (MAF) which performs the accumulate operation (A times B) + C as an indivisible operation. This single functional unit reduces the latency for chained floating-point operations, as well as rounding errors and chip busing. It also reduces the number of adders/normalizers by combining the addition required for fast multiplication with accumulation. The MAF unit is made practical by a unique fast-shifter, which eases the overlap of multiplication and addition, and a leading-zero/one anticipator, which eases overlap of normalization and addition. The accumulate instruction required by this architecture reduces the instruction path length by combining two instructions into one. Additionally, the RS/6000 FPU is tightly coupled to the rest of the CPU, unlike typical floating-point coprocessor chips. As a result, floating-point and fixed-point instructions can be executed simultaneously. Load/store operations are performed using register renaming and store buffering to allow completely independent operation of load/store with arithmetic operations. Thus, data-cache accesses can occur in parallel with independent arithmetic operations. This unit attains a peak execution rate of 50 MFLOPS with a 25-MHz clock frequency and is capable of sustaining nearly that rate in complex programs such as graphics and Livermore loops.","doi":"10.1147/rd.341.0059","publicationTitle":"IBM Journal of Research and Development","displayPublicationTitle":"IBM Journal of Research and Development","pdfPath":"/iel5/5288520/5389853/05389859.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1147/rd.341.0059","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5389853","startPage":"59","endPage":"70","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design of the IBM RISC System/6000 floating-point execution unit","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5389859","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IBM","displayDocTitle":"Design of the IBM RISC System/6000 floating-point execution unit","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  1990","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5389859/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  1990","isJournal":true,"volume":"34","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 1990","dateOfInsertion":"06 April 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design of the IBM RISC System/6000 floating-point execution unit","sourcePdf":"ibmrd3401G.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.020842S","chronDate":"Jan.  1990","isNumber":"5389853","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5288520","citationCount":"95","articleId":"5389859","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IBM","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5389860,"authors":[{"name":"E.

Unlike the conventional procedures applied thus far, the so-called leading-zero anticipator (LZA) of the RS/6000 carries out processing of the leading zeros and ones in parallel with floating-point addition. Therefore, the new circuitry reduces the total latency of the MAF unit by enabling the normalization and addition to take place in a single cycle.","displayPublicationTitle":"IBM Journal of Research and Development","pdfPath":"/iel5/5288520/5389853/05389860.pdf","startPage":"71","endPage":"77","publicationTitle":"IBM Journal of Research and Development","doi":"10.1147/rd.341.0071","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1147/rd.341.0071","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5389853","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5389860","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Leading-zero anticipator (LZA) in the IBM RISC System/6000 floating-point execution unit","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IBM","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5389860/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  1990","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  1990","displayDocTitle":"Leading-zero anticipator (LZA) in the IBM RISC System/6000 floating-point execution unit","volume":"34","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 1990","dateOfInsertion":"06 April 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Leading-zero anticipator (LZA) in the IBM RISC System/6000 floating-point execution unit","sourcePdf":"ibmrd3401H.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.016436S","chronDate":"Jan.  1990","isNumber":"5389853","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5288520","citationCount":"41","articleId":"5389860","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IBM","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5389861,"authors":[{"name":"I.

The components involved include a common on-chip processor (COP) that executes the chip self-test sequence and provides an interface to the COP bus, a serial bus (COP bus) that links the chips to OCS and ESP, an on-card sequencer (OCS) that controls the self-test and system initialization sequences, and an engineering support processor (ESP) that is used for system verification, bring-up, and debug. Almost all RISC System/6000* chips contain embedded RAMs such as register files, caches, and directories; therefore, the self-test methodology described here is particularly suitable for logic chips that contain embedded arrays. Logic and RAM self-test is executed by a control processor (COP) integrated on the chips. The COP controls the self-test sequence, generates pseudorandom test vectors, scans them into chip registers, and provides the select lines that establish a one-to-one correspondence between RAM input/output and chip registers. The COP also drives RAM read/write lines during self-test, scans the captured RAM outputs, and compresses them to obtain a signature. After the vectors are scanned in, the chip runs for one or two system cycles, the logic outputs are captured in registers, and the chip state is scanned back into the COP, where it is compressed to obtain a signature. This procedure is repeated many times, and the final signature is then compared with a predetermined \u201cgood\u201d signature to establish whether the chip is good or bad. Special techniques are developed to improve the coverage of logic that feeds RAMS or receives its inputs from RAMs. Both ac and dc self-test are described. The self-test sequence is controlled by a program stored in the OCS, and ESP is used during system bring-up to set up break-points and to display and modify the machine state.","displayPublicationTitle":"IBM Journal of Research and Development","pdfPath":"/iel5/5288520/5389853/05389861.pdf","startPage":"78","endPage":"84","publicationTitle":"IBM Journal of Research and Development","doi":"10.1147/rd.341.0078","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1147/rd.341.0078","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5389853","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5389861","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Pseudorandom built-in self-test methodology and implementation for the IBM RISC System/6000 processor","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IBM","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5389861/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  1990","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  1990","displayDocTitle":"Pseudorandom built-in self-test methodology and implementation for the IBM RISC System/6000 processor","volume":"34","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 1990","dateOfInsertion":"06 April 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Pseudorandom built-in self-test methodology and implementation for the IBM RISC System/6000 processor","sourcePdf":"ibmrd3401I.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.078934S","chronDate":"Jan.  1990","isNumber":"5389853","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5288520","citationCount":"22","articleId":"5389861","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IBM","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5389866,"authors":[{"name":"P.

Electro-optic sampling is an optical probing technique which has ultrashort temporal resolution and is capable of noninvasively probing ICs at internal nodes. This technique is voltage-sensitive because it relies upon the electric field produced by the signal voltage on the device under test (DUT). The electric field (and hence the voltage) can be sampled because it produces birefringence in an electro-optic crystal which changes the state of polarization of an ultrashort-duration optical probe pulse that propagates through the electro-optic crystal. The electro-optic crystal is the substrate of the DUT for direct probing, is a crystal on a separate test structure for hybrid probing, and is a separate crystal placed above the DUT for external probing. Temporal resolution below 1 ps and a sensitivity below 0.1 mV/\u221aHz have been demonstrated (though not in the same experiment). The principles of electro-optic sampling are reviewed in this paper. Selected applications for measurement of high-speed waveforms in discrete devices and in ICs are presented.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5389869","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1147/rd.342.0141","publicationTitle":"IBM Journal of Research and Development","displayPublicationTitle":"IBM Journal of Research and Development","pdfPath":"/iel5/5288520/5389869/05389871.pdf","startPage":"141","endPage":"161","doi":"10.1147/rd.342.0141","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Electro-optic sampling of high-speed devices and integrated circuits","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IBM","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1990","displayDocTitle":"Electro-optic sampling of high-speed devices and integrated circuits","volume":"34","issue":"2.3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 1990","dateOfInsertion":"06 April 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5389871/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1990","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Electro-optic sampling of high-speed devices and integrated circuits","sourcePdf":"ibmrd3402a3C.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.024162S","chronDate":"March  1990","isNumber":"5389869","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5288520","citationCount":"22","articleId":"5389871","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IBM","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":5389876,"authors":[{"name":"F.

It is shown that in the case of waveform measurements on 1.1-\u00b5m interconnection lines, the crosstalk is only \u223c3%. The voltage resolution is sufficient to allow the sense signal of a 4-Mb DRAM (dynamic random access memory) to be measured. Further internal measurements with the electron probe for the chip verification of the 4-Mb DRAM are also shown which demonstrate the flexibility and the benefits of electron-beam testing. On the basis of the measured performance data and its successful use in the circuit analysis of the 4-Mb DRAM, the submicron electron-beam tester appears to be suitable also for VLSI circuits with reduced design rules, e.g., for the 16-Mb DRAM.

Measurements are described in which the time and amplitude of the resistance change due to each capture and emission event from an individual trap are extracted to obtain the average capture and emission times, and the amplitude of the resistance change, at different temperatures, device biases, and light intensities. Techniques are described for using the data at different biases to characterize the trap, find the location of the trap in the device, and then use the trap as a probe of the oxide field (or surface potential) and the surface charge density within a 5-50-\u00c5 radius of the trap. In some devices a single trap can be resolved over almost all designed bias regions of the FET near room temperature. In effect, individual traps can be used as internal probes into VLSI devices of the present and future. Results from 2D computer device modeling of these devices are used to evaluate and understand these techniques. Methods for applying these techniques to the study of device degradation are discussed.

More than 60,000 modules, representing chips from the same IBM computer system, have been delay-tested using the technique presented in this paper. The test technique uses the stuck-fault patterns for level-sensitive scan design (LSSD) product. The stuck-fault patterns are modified or \u201ctwisted\u201d according to specific algorithms to propagate transitions through paths just prior to the output measure. The patterns are applied at system speed timings provided by the chip designers. Any gross delay defect present in a tested path causes a fail. The failing modules were characterized to determine the size of the delay defects. Failure diagnostics were performed on the defective modules by using existing stuck-fault diagnostic tools and a development version of a transition fault simulator. These were sent to physical failure analysis for delayering, visual verification, and electrical characterization.

These cellular automata logic block observation (CALBO) circuits provide an alternative to conventional design for testability circuitry such as built-in logic block observation (BILBO) as a direct consequence of reduced cross-correlation between the bit streams which are used as inputs to the logic unit under test. The issue of generating probabilistically weighted test patterns for use in built-in self test is also addressed. The methodology presented considers the suitability of incorporating structures based on cellular automata, a strategy which, in general, improves test pattern quality. Thus, CA-based structures quality as attractive candidates for use in weighted test pattern generator design. The analysis involved in determining and statistically evaluating these potential models is discussed, and is compared with that for previous as well as statistically independent models. Relevant signature analysis properties for elementary one-dimensional cellular automata are also discussed.

These limitations are eliminated when the calculations make use of the scan function. The second program simulates clustered fault locations on a map. The clusters are initially generated using a radial Gaussian probability distribution. Each fault location is stored as a complex number, which facilitates the use of cluster-shaping programs that are also described. In a third program, another simulator of fault maps, faults are added as a function of time. This program also results in fault distributions that are clustered. In addition, it produces frequency distributions that very closely approximate negative binomial distributions.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IBM","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov.  1989","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  1989","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5389907/","volume":"33","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 1989","dateOfInsertion":"06 April 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Fault-simulation programs for integrated-circuit yield estimations","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fault-simulation programs for integrated-circuit yield estimations","sourcePdf":"ibmrd3306F.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.035861S","chronDate":"Nov.  1989","isNumber":"5389902","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5288520","citationCount":"5","articleId":"5389907","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IBM","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5389945,"authors":[{"name":"C.

The trend toward higher densities and data rates presents continuing demands for an ability to operate at a lower signal-to-noise ratio and to tolerate an increased number of correctable errors. Heretofore, the magnetic disk storage products used coding schemes that provided correction of one burst of errors in a record of length ranging from a few bytes of data to a full track on the disk. In this paper, we present a new coding architecture that facilitates correction of multiple-burst errors in each record in a typical disk storage application. This architecture embodies a two-level coding scheme which offers high coding efficiency along with a fast decoding strategy that closely matches the requirements of on-line correction of multiple bursts of errors. The first level has a smaller block delay and provides very fast correction of most of the errors commonly encountered in an average disk file. The second level, on a larger block size, provides reserve capability for correcting additional errors which may be encountered in a device with symptoms of a weaker component or an oncoming failure. The new IBM 3380J and 3380K disk files use a two-level scheme that is designed around the coding structure of the extended Reed-Solomon code. This design and the related encoding and decoding methods and implementation are presented in detail.","doi":"10.1147/rd.334.0470","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1147/rd.334.0470","publicationTitle":"IBM Journal of Research and Development","displayPublicationTitle":"IBM Journal of Research and Development","pdfPath":"/iel5/5288520/5389942/05389948.pdf","startPage":"470","endPage":"484","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5389942","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Two-level coding for error control in magnetic disk storage products","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IBM","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5389948/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  1989","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"July  1989","displayDocTitle":"Two-level coding for error control in magnetic disk storage products","volume":"33","issue":"4","dateOfInsertion":"06 April 2010","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"July 1989","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Two-level coding for error control in magnetic disk storage products","sourcePdf":"ibmrd3304G.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.035351S","chronDate":"July  1989","isNumber":"5389942","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5288520","citationCount":"10","articleId":"5389948","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IBM","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":5389956,"authors":[{"name":"Thomas D.

Statistics such as the density of 1s, the probabilities of specific code strings or run lengths, and the power spectrum are useful in analyzing the performance of RLL codes in these applications. These statistics are easy to compute for ideal run-length-limited codes, those whose only constraints are the run-length limits, but ideal RLL codes are not usable in practice because their code rates are irrational. Implemented RLL codes achieve rational rates by not using all code sequences which satisfy the run-length constraints, and their statistics are different from those of the ideal RLL codes. Little attention has been paid to the computation of statistics for these practical codes. In this paper a method is presented for computing statistics of implemented codes. The key step is to develop an exact description of the code sequences which are used. A consequence of the code having rational rate is that all the code-string and run-length probabilities are rational. The method is illustrated by applying it to three codes of practical importance: MFM, (2, 7), and (1, 7).","doi":"10.1147/rd.331.0060","publicationTitle":"IBM Journal of Research and Development","displayPublicationTitle":"IBM Journal of Research and Development","pdfPath":"/iel5/5288520/5389951/05389956.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1147/rd.331.0060","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5389951","startPage":"60","endPage":"73","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Statistical properties of selected recording codes","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5389956","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IBM","displayDocTitle":"Statistical properties of selected recording codes","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  1989","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5389956/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  1989","isJournal":true,"volume":"33","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 1989","dateOfInsertion":"06 April 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Statistical properties of selected recording codes","sourcePdf":"ibmrd3301F.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.013119S","chronDate":"Jan.  1989","isNumber":"5389951","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5288520","citationCount":"24","articleId":"5389956","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IBM","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5389964,"authors":[{"name":"J.

This architecture permits the reuse of adapter and arithmetic coder logic in a universal way, which together with application-specific model logic can create a variety of powerful compression systems. The specific version of the adapter/coder used herein is the \u201cQ-Coder,\u201d described in various companion papers. The hardware implementation is in a single HCMOS chip, to maximize speed and minimize cost. The primary purpose of the chip is to provide superior data compression performance for bilevel image data by using conditional binary source models together with adaptive arithmetic coding. The coding scheme implemented is called the Adaptive Bilevel Image Compression (ABIC) algorithm. On business documents, it consistently outperforms such nonadaptive algorithms as the CCITT Group 4 (T.6) Standard and comes into its own when adapting to documents scanned at different resolutions or which include significantly different data such as digital halftones. The multi-purpose nature of the chip allows access to internal partition combinations such as the \u201cQ\u201d adapter/coder, which in combination with external logic can be used to realize hardware for other compression applications. On-chip memory limitations can also be overcome by the addition of external memory in special cases. Other options include the uploading and downloading of adaptive statistics and choices to encode or decode, with or without adaptation of these statistics.","doi":"10.1147/rd.326.0775","publicationTitle":"IBM Journal of Research and Development","displayPublicationTitle":"IBM Journal of Research and Development","pdfPath":"/iel5/5288520/5389985/05389986.pdf","startPage":"775","endPage":"795","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1147/rd.326.0775","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5389985","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5389986","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A multi-purpose VLSI chip for adaptive data compression of bilevel images","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IBM","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  1988","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov.  1988","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5389986/","displayDocTitle":"A multi-purpose VLSI chip for adaptive data compression of bilevel images","volume":"32","issue":"6","publicationDate":"Nov. 1988","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 April 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A multi-purpose VLSI chip for adaptive data compression of bilevel images","sourcePdf":"arps.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.019797S","chronDate":"Nov.  1988","isNumber":"5389985","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5288520","citationCount":"33","articleId":"5389986","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1988","subType":"IBM","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5389988,"authors":[{"name":"W.
