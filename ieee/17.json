Bulk micromachining is widely practiced using double-sided processes, while the single-sided dissolved-wafer bulk process offers advantages for many applications. Surface micromachining avoids the necessity of deep etching of the wafer bulk but requires careful control of stress in the deposited films and protection of the wafer during the sacrificial etch. Wafer-scale bonding processes such as electrostatic bonding and silicon fusion offer additional tools for the creation of three-dimensional microstructures. Electroforming processes such as LIGA allow structural thicknesses as great as 100 mu m with micron or submicron lateral features. The application of these processes and microstructures to neuroelectronic interfaces, mass flow and microflow sensors, and multichannel submicron surface profilometers is described. The extension of these approaches to complete integrated microsystems, realized monolithically or as multichip hybrids, is discussed, and applications in areas such as millimeter-wave components and vacuum microelectronics are examined.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/CORNEL.1991.170011","displayPublicationTitle":"[1991] Proceedings IEEE/Cornell Conference on Advanced Concepts in High Speed Semiconductor Devices and Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel2/616/4402/00170011.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4402","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CORNEL.1991.170011","publicationTitle":"[1991] Proceedings IEEE/Cornell Conference on Advanced Concepts in High Speed Semiconductor Devices and Circuits","startPage":"412","endPage":"424","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Integrated silicon sensors: technology and microstructures","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=170011","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-7 Aug 1991","displayDocTitle":"Integrated silicon sensors: technology and microstructures","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/170011/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1991","accessionNumber":"4234119","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"5-7 Aug. 1991","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Integrated silicon sensors: technology and microstructures","confLoc":"Ithaca, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"00170011.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062206S","chronDate":"5-7 Aug 1991","isNumber":"4402","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"616","articleId":"170011","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":170048,"authors":[{"name":"T.A.

A large signal MESFET model is used to simultaneously optimize doping and circuit parameters. Efficiency is found to be most sensitive to the breakdown voltage of the MESFET, which can be improved by reducing I/sub dss/, lowering the surface doping concentration, and allowing the peak doping region to be deeper in the channel. High efficiency cannot be obtained without proper harmonic tuning at both the load and generator side of the MESFET. Second harmonic impedances at the generator and load must be minimized. The third harmonic impedance at the generator and load should be maximized while the fundamental impedances should be selected to conjugately match the device.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Doping profiles","Gallium arsenide","MESFETs","Semiconductor process modeling","Radiofrequency amplifiers","Radio frequency","Microwave amplifiers","Physics","Circuits","Electric breakdown"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["doping profiles","field effect integrated circuits","gallium arsenide","III-V semiconductors","impedance matching","microwave amplifiers","MMIC","Schottky gate field effect transistors","semiconductor device models","tuning"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["second harmonic impedances","X-band","MMIC","optimum class B performance","MESFET amplifiers","doping profiles","matching circuit conditions","maximum power added efficiency","large signal MESFET model","circuit parameters","breakdown voltage","surface doping concentration","harmonic tuning","third harmonic impedance","fundamental impedances","75 percent","GaAs"]}],"doi":"10.1109/CORNEL.1991.170048","publicationTitle":"[1991] Proceedings IEEE/Cornell Conference on Advanced Concepts in High Speed Semiconductor Devices and Circuits","displayPublicationTitle":"[1991] Proceedings IEEE/Cornell Conference on Advanced Concepts in High Speed Semiconductor Devices and Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel2/616/4402/00170048.pdf","startPage":"188","endPage":"197","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4402","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CORNEL.1991.170048","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Doping profiles for optimum class B performance of GaAs MESFET amplifiers","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=170048","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Doping profiles for optimum class B performance of GaAs MESFET amplifiers","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/170048/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1991","accessionNumber":"4239433","conferenceDate":"5-7 Aug. 1991","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-7 Aug 1991","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Doping profiles for optimum class B performance of GaAs MESFET amplifiers","confLoc":"Ithaca, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"00170048.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.025568S","chronDate":"5-7 Aug 1991","isNumber":"4402","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"616","citationCount":"2","articleId":"170048","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":170318,"authors":[{"name":"M.R.

It is easy to work, as it has few language constructs, yet it allows the definition of various kinds of neural network models and learning rules designed by the user.

The effect of the reliability of recall of variously configured ADAM systems is examined by injecting faults individually, and also in various combinations since correlations between them will influence their overall effect on the system. Analysis of the results indicates that fault tolerance actually arises in a similar manner to N-modular redundancy. An enhancement is made to the ADAM system which improves storage capacity and recall, and allows the results to be generally applied. It is concluded that to achieve a fault tolerant ADAM system, a large number (at least 20) of small tuple units (around three inputs) should be used. With such a configuration, an ADAM system would be very likely to provide failure-free operation for up to about 30000 h before gracefully degrading.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.1991.170372","startPage":"1","endPage":"6 vol.1","publicationTitle":"[Proceedings] 1991 IEEE International Joint Conference on Neural Networks","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.1991.170372","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4411","displayPublicationTitle":"[Proceedings] 1991 IEEE International Joint Conference on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel2/602/4411/00170372.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Operational fault tolerance of the ADAM neural network system","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/170372/","displayDocTitle":"Operational fault tolerance of the ADAM neural network system","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"4248835","publicationDate":"1991","dateOfInsertion":"12 September 2019","conferenceDate":"18-21 Nov. 1991","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 Nov. 1991","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Operational fault tolerance of the ADAM neural network system","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"00170372.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.034985S","chronDate":"18-21 Nov. 1991","isNumber":"4411","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"602","articleId":"170372","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":170373,"authors":[{"name":"S.

The results obtained show that the proposed methods for dealing with continuous attributes perform better than the splitting of the attribute's values with exact bounds.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.1991.170395","pdfPath":"/iel2/602/4411/00170395.pdf","startPage":"146","endPage":"151 vol.1","displayPublicationTitle":"[Proceedings] 1991 IEEE International Joint Conference on Neural Networks","publicationTitle":"[Proceedings] 1991 IEEE International Joint Conference on Neural Networks","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.1991.170395","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4411","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Feedforward Bayesian neural network and continuous attributes","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/170395/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 Nov. 1991","displayDocTitle":"Feedforward Bayesian neural network and continuous attributes","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"12 September 2019","accessionNumber":"4248858","publicationDate":"1991","conferenceDate":"18-21 Nov. 1991","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Feedforward Bayesian neural network and continuous attributes","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"00170395.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050038S","chronDate":"18-21 Nov. 1991","isNumber":"4411","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"602","articleId":"170395","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":170396,"authors":[{"name":"K.

Second, the neural identification has been successfully tested on a complex nonlinear composite system which includes formidable, but realistic, nonlinear process characteristics such as hysteresis. This has helped to demonstrate the general applicability of identification using neural techniques. Third, the novel method of neural identification was compared with online identification based on the well-established linear least-squares technique.

Through extensive computer experiments with real time series, the neural-network-based TSM proved promising due to its robust pattern-recognition ability in two aspects: it not only avoids statistical difficulties, but also provides more user-friendly decision-making aids for forecasting purposes.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.1991.170409","publicationTitle":"[Proceedings] 1991 IEEE International Joint Conference on Neural Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"[Proceedings] 1991 IEEE International Joint Conference on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel2/602/4411/00170409.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.1991.170409","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4411","startPage":"232","endPage":"236 vol.1","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Neural network-based time series modeling: ARMA model identification via ESACF approach","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=170409","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Neural network-based time series modeling: ARMA model identification via ESACF approach","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 Nov. 1991","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/170409/","conferenceDate":"18-21 Nov. 1991","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1991","accessionNumber":"4254048","dateOfInsertion":"12 September 2019","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Neural network-based time series modeling: ARMA model identification via ESACF approach","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"00170409.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.015593S","chronDate":"18-21 Nov. 1991","isNumber":"4411","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"602","articleId":"170409","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":170411,"authors":[{"name":"H.

The purpose is to reduce computation time and achieve real-time capability. A tomography method is chosen, as most medical images are tomographic in nature. Two approaches are taken. The first approach starts with applying neural networks right from the beginning during the recording of the scattered wavefronts. The second approach is to apply neural networks only after the reconstruction of the image for image processing. The Hopfield model of neural networks is used for both approaches. The procedures for both cases are given. A detailed analysis for both cases is given, and a study is made concerning which approach will give the shorter computation time. Preliminary estimates show that when applying the neural network right from wavefield recording in the beginning, one needs about 10/sup 4/ iterations to resolve two object points. If the neural network is applied to process the image after the reconstruction, about 200 iterations are required for an L=256 and M=256 image.

It is shown that this approach gives equally good results in tracking tasks as the optimal Kalman filtering procedure, and that it even overcomes classification results obtained with Fourier transformations of an object's contours. With parallel processing real time applications seem feasible. The input images are taken sequentially from digitized TV pictures showing the 3-D object's movement along its trajectories. It is the responsibility of the tracking function to make the changes of the window properly. It is shown that with the proposed tracking neural network the same quality of tracking can be achieved as with the Kalman filtering method. The classification of moving objects performed by the classification neural network also gives encouraging results.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.1991.170421","startPage":"313","endPage":"324 vol.1","displayPublicationTitle":"[Proceedings] 1991 IEEE International Joint Conference on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel2/602/4411/00170421.pdf","publicationTitle":"[Proceedings] 1991 IEEE International Joint Conference on Neural Networks","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.1991.170421","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4411","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Tracking and classifying 3D objects from TV pictures-a neural network approach","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["TV","Neural networks","Filtering","Parallel processing","Computer science","Kalman filters","Humans","Speech processing","Pattern recognition","Neural network hardware"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neural nets","pattern recognition","tracking","video signals"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["3D object tracking","pattern recognition","3D object classification","TV pictures","neural network"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/170421/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 Nov. 1991","displayDocTitle":"Tracking and classifying 3D objects from TV pictures-a neural network approach","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1991","dateOfInsertion":"12 September 2019","conferenceDate":"18-21 Nov. 1991","accessionNumber":"4269584","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Tracking and classifying 3D objects from TV pictures-a neural network approach","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"00170421.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.020972S","chronDate":"18-21 Nov. 1991","isNumber":"4411","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"602","citationCount":"1","articleId":"170421","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":170425,"authors":[{"name":"N.

Then the facial expression information is generated and input into the input units of the neural network; network learning and recognition are done by a backpropagation algorithm.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.1991.170444","startPage":"460","endPage":"466 vol.1","displayPublicationTitle":"[Proceedings] 1991 IEEE International Joint Conference on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel2/602/4411/00170444.pdf","publicationTitle":"[Proceedings] 1991 IEEE International Joint Conference on Neural Networks","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.1991.170444","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4411","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The recognition of basic facial expressions by neural network","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Face recognition","Neural networks","Humans","Robots","Emotion recognition","Charge coupled devices","Charge-coupled image sensors","Eyebrows","Eyes","Mouth"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer vision","computerised pattern recognition","learning systems","neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["facial expression recognition","CCD camera","learning systems","pattern recognition","robot vision","neural network","human emotion recognition","facial feature-points","backpropagation algorithm"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/170444/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 Nov. 1991","displayDocTitle":"The recognition of basic facial expressions by neural network","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1991","dateOfInsertion":"12 September 2019","conferenceDate":"18-21 Nov. 1991","accessionNumber":"4269607","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The recognition of basic facial expressions by neural network","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"00170444.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042943S","chronDate":"18-21 Nov. 1991","isNumber":"4411","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"602","citationCount":"67","articleId":"170444","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":170446,"authors":[{"name":"S.

A dual representational scheme is devised, utilizing both localist and distributed representations and exploring the synergy resulting from the interaction between the two.

The conventional algorithm uses a hard decision criterion (one and zero supervisor signals) and suffers from the overlearning problem. In contrast, the proposed training algorithm uses fuzzy-decision supervision which has a gray scale between zero and one. In phoneme sample space, the algorithm uses neighboring information or considers overlap regions of phoneme distribution boundaries. The supervisor signal for a training sample is determined reflecting the distribution of the other training samples around the original sample. It therefore softens the hard decision criterion for phoneme recognition and prevents the overlearning problem. Several NN architectures are trained with the fuzzy training algorithm by using b, d, g, m, n and N from the Japanese vocabulary uttered in different speaking styles.

Two conventional methods are discussed (fault injection and mean-time-before-failure), and certain deficiencies are noted. From this, a more suitable service degradation method is developed. The importance of choosing a reasonable timescale for a simulation environment is also discussed. Examples of each style of simulation method are given for the multilayer perceptron.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.1991.170462","pdfPath":"/iel2/602/4411/00170462.pdf","startPage":"578","endPage":"583 vol.1","displayPublicationTitle":"[Proceedings] 1991 IEEE International Joint Conference on Neural Networks","publicationTitle":"[Proceedings] 1991 IEEE International Joint Conference on Neural Networks","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.1991.170462","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4411","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Assessing the reliability of artificial neural networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/170462/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 Nov. 1991","displayDocTitle":"Assessing the reliability of artificial neural networks","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"12 September 2019","accessionNumber":"4259726","publicationDate":"1991","conferenceDate":"18-21 Nov. 1991","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Assessing the reliability of artificial neural networks","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"00170462.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.025948S","chronDate":"18-21 Nov. 1991","isNumber":"4411","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"602","articleId":"170462","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":170470,"authors":[{"name":"Y.

It is shown that the classical approach using the original Hopfield network leads to evident numerical problems, and hence is not practicable. The heuristic choice of the Lagrange parameters, as presented in the literature, can result in incorrect solutions for variable dimensions, or is very time consuming, in order to search the correct parameter sets. The modified method using eigenvalue analysis using predetermined parameters yields recognizable improvements.

On the other hand, when it does not converge, a new unit is added. The goodness factor is defined to represent the total amount of feedforward-propagated signal by the unit, and is easily calculated.

The proposed parallel algorithm for large-size problems outperforms the best known algorithms in terms of computation time with much the same solution quality where the conventional branch-and-bound method cannot be used due to the exponentially increasing computation time.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.1991.170515","startPage":"905","endPage":"910 vol.2","publicationTitle":"[Proceedings] 1991 IEEE International Joint Conference on Neural Networks","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.1991.170515","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4411","displayPublicationTitle":"[Proceedings] 1991 IEEE International Joint Conference on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel2/602/4411/00170515.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A parallel neural network computing for the maximum clique problem","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/170515/","displayDocTitle":"A parallel neural network computing for the maximum clique problem","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"4254105","publicationDate":"1991","dateOfInsertion":"12 September 2019","conferenceDate":"18-21 Nov. 1991","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 Nov. 1991","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A parallel neural network computing for the maximum clique problem","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"00170515.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.03026S","chronDate":"18-21 Nov. 1991","isNumber":"4411","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"602","citationCount":"5","articleId":"170515","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":170519,"authors":[{"name":"B.

It is partly based on the model of Kohonen. The proposed approach differs from former work in this direction as no ring structure with a fixed number of elements is used. Instead a small initial structure is enlarged during a distribution process. This makes it possible to replace the central search step, which normally needs time O(n), by a local procedure that needs time O(1). Since the total number of search steps that must be performed is O(n) the runtime of the model scales linearly with problem size. This is better than every known neural or conventional algorithm. The path lengths of the solutions generated are less than 10% longer than the optimum solutions of solved problems from the literature.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.1991.170519","startPage":"929","endPage":"934 vol.2","displayPublicationTitle":"[Proceedings] 1991 IEEE International Joint Conference on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel2/602/4411/00170519.pdf","publicationTitle":"[Proceedings] 1991 IEEE International Joint Conference on Neural Networks","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.1991.170519","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4411","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"FLEXMAP-a neural network for the traveling salesman problem with linear time and space complexity","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Traveling salesman problems","Space exploration","Cities and towns","Joining processes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","neural nets","operations research"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["self-organizing network","Kohonen model","linear time complexity","linear space complexity","FLEXMAP","neural network","traveling salesman problem","initial structure","distribution process","central search step","search steps","problem size","path lengths","optimum solutions"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/170519/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 Nov. 1991","displayDocTitle":"FLEXMAP-a neural network for the traveling salesman problem with linear time and space complexity","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1991","dateOfInsertion":"12 September 2019","conferenceDate":"18-21 Nov. 1991","accessionNumber":"4254109","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FLEXMAP-a neural network for the traveling salesman problem with linear time and space complexity","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"00170519.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.032595S","chronDate":"18-21 Nov. 1991","isNumber":"4411","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"602","citationCount":"13","articleId":"170519","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":170522,"authors":[{"name":"N.J.

This enables the state trajectory to climb out of local minima while tending toward areas not yet visited, thus performing an efficient search of the problem's energy surface. For a quadratic penalty function, the learning equation causes the connection weights and bias currents to be modified continuously based on local information. Simulations on the 20-city traveling salesman problem indicate that quadratic tabu learning finds solutions of a given cost 65 times more quickly than repetitive gradient descent using random initial states. Simulations on the 100-node maximum independent set problem indicate that tabu learning finds the optimal solution 60 to 600 times more quickly.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.1991.170523","pdfPath":"/iel2/602/4411/00170523.pdf","startPage":"953","endPage":"961 vol.2","displayPublicationTitle":"[Proceedings] 1991 IEEE International Joint Conference on Neural Networks","publicationTitle":"[Proceedings] 1991 IEEE International Joint Conference on Neural Networks","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.1991.170523","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4411","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Tabu learning: a neural network search method for solving nonconvex optimization problems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/170523/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 Nov. 1991","displayDocTitle":"Tabu learning: a neural network search method for solving nonconvex optimization problems","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"12 September 2019","accessionNumber":"4259737","publicationDate":"1991","conferenceDate":"18-21 Nov. 1991","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Tabu learning: a neural network search method for solving nonconvex optimization problems","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"00170523.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052575S","chronDate":"18-21 Nov. 1991","isNumber":"4411","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"602","citationCount":"12","articleId":"170523","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":170526,"authors":[{"name":"A.

This is done by applying a structured approach, i.e., by decomposing the overall control system into its main components (linearizer, acceleration controller, and inverse kinematics) and describing each component by several smaller networks. It is then possible to train each network effectively and interlink them to produce smooth control of the robot. A principal advantage of using a neural network as the controller is that it can be used to specify any controller behavior. For the given task of moving the robot arm from initial rest position to a final specified position, the position profiles showed that, using neural networks, the manipulator arm could be moved smoothly. The torque profiles clearly revealed the robustness of the neural network.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.1991.170537","pdfPath":"/iel2/602/4411/00170537.pdf","startPage":"1059","endPage":"1066 vol.2","displayPublicationTitle":"[Proceedings] 1991 IEEE International Joint Conference on Neural Networks","publicationTitle":"[Proceedings] 1991 IEEE International Joint Conference on Neural Networks","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.1991.170537","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4411","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Structured neural-network approach to robot motion control","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/170537/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 Nov. 1991","displayDocTitle":"Structured neural-network approach to robot motion control","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"12 September 2019","accessionNumber":"4259752","publicationDate":"1991","conferenceDate":"18-21 Nov. 1991","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Structured neural-network approach to robot motion control","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"00170537.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.028077S","chronDate":"18-21 Nov. 1991","isNumber":"4411","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"602","articleId":"170537","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-11"},{"_id":170538,"authors":[{"name":"A.

The formation of the series is carried out by many important properties exhibited by the implied minterm structure (IMS) of a linearly separable function. The learning algorithm produces the representation much faster than backpropagation and, unlike the latter, does not encounter the problem of local minima.

Therefore, the preprocessing of the image data is reduced to the calculation of gray-value histograms on a 10*10 pixel window. By using only eight gray-value classes in the histograms, an efficient reduction of the data is obtained. The histograms calculated on each window are presented to a three-layered perceptron net for defect detection and classification.

The two-stage network consists of a first-stage Hopfield network to suppress noise, and a second stage using a bidirectional associative memory (BAM) to make the decision as to whether a target has been detected or not. A second architecture using only a single BAM stage is also presented for illustrative purposes. The target is assumed to be emitting a single tone sinusoid as its signature. The system also assumes only white Gaussian noise perturbation to the signal. It is shown that this network structure provides correct detection at a signal-to-noise ratio of -21 dB, a 6 dB improvement in target detection over a similar network using a perceptron in the second stage. Performance is shown to be limited to the size of the Hopfield network, in the first stage, and to the training set applied to it.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.1991.170552","startPage":"1154","endPage":"1159 vol.2","publicationTitle":"[Proceedings] 1991 IEEE International Joint Conference on Neural Networks","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.1991.170552","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4411","displayPublicationTitle":"[Proceedings] 1991 IEEE International Joint Conference on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel2/602/4411/00170552.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Passive sonar processing using neural networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/170552/","displayDocTitle":"Passive sonar processing using neural networks","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"4259767","publicationDate":"1991","dateOfInsertion":"12 September 2019","conferenceDate":"18-21 Nov. 1991","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 Nov. 1991","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Passive sonar processing using neural networks","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"00170552.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.037103S","chronDate":"18-21 Nov. 1991","isNumber":"4411","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"602","articleId":"170552","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":170553,"authors":[{"name":"Young-Mo Koo","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Yonsei University, Seoul, South Korea"],"lastName":"Young-Mo Koo","id":"37087907889"},{"name":"Kwang Bang Woo","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Yonsei University, Seoul, South Korea"],"lastName":"Kwang Bang Woo","id":"37087144642"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-0227-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"170553","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":53},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hopfield neural networks","Intelligent networks","Transfer functions","Parameter estimation","Differential equations","Regulators","Polynomials","Recursive estimation","State estimation","Symmetric matrices"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["control system synthesis","neural nets","parameter estimation","poles and zeros","self-adjusting systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Hopfield neural network","self-tuning control","pole placement","model output solution","parameter estimation","controller design","second-order linear time invariant plant","permanent-magnet DC motor model","exponentially weighted recursive least squares","Gaussian elimination method","Diophantine equation"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=170553","abstract":"An indirect self-tuning controller (STC) based on pole placement is designed with the application of a Hopfield neural network to the estimation of plant parameters and the design of the controller, the Hopfield neural network model is completely examined as to the uniqueness of the model output solution, and its application in parameter estimation and controller design is also described.

The model is evaluated on printed Kanji characters with high similarity in each of 893 small categories with an average of 2.8 characters per category. It improves the discrimination accuracy from 98.87% without it to 99.55%, a 60% reduction in errors on a test data set of more than 13 fonts. A large scale neural network of three-stage hierarchical structure for Kanji character recognition is presented whose third stage is constructed by this model.

Several architectures of multilayer neural networks have been studied but the emphasis of this investigation has been placed on recurrent multilayer neural networks.

Three scenarios are considered: (1) two similar objects in five orientations; (2) two dissimilar objects in five orientations; and (3) three objects in three orientations. The orientations are identified by a rotation of the viewing position around one of the principal axes of the object. The author compares two configurations: one involves a multilayer perceptron (MLP) with three hidden layers and the other consists of an MLP in series with a bidirectional associative memory (BAM). In both cases the backpropagation paradigm was used to train the multilayer perceptron. It is shown that the BAM can be used in conjunction with an MLP to recognize objects and their orientations with a level of accuracy and reliability that allows such a configuration to be useful for the rapid positioning of grippers during robotic handling.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 Nov. 1991","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/170634/","accessionNumber":"4269661","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1991","dateOfInsertion":"12 September 2019","conferenceDate":"18-21 Nov. 1991","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Applying artificial neural networks to object and orientation recognition for robotic handling","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Applying artificial neural networks to object and orientation recognition for robotic handling","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"00170634.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.025836S","chronDate":"18-21 Nov. 1991","isNumber":"4411","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"602","citationCount":"3","articleId":"170634","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":170637,"authors":[{"name":"H.

Its performance is illustrated on some examples, such as a XOR logical operation and a nonlinear mapping of two continuous signals.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.1991.170644","startPage":"2044","endPage":"2049 vol.3","publicationTitle":"[Proceedings] 1991 IEEE International Joint Conference on Neural Networks","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.1991.170644","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4411","displayPublicationTitle":"[Proceedings] 1991 IEEE International Joint Conference on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel2/602/4411/00170644.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A parallel Kalman algorithm for fast learning of multilayer neural networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/170644/","displayDocTitle":"A parallel Kalman algorithm for fast learning of multilayer neural networks","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"4269735","publicationDate":"1991","dateOfInsertion":"12 September 2019","conferenceDate":"18-21 Nov. 1991","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 Nov. 1991","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A parallel Kalman algorithm for fast learning of multilayer neural networks","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"00170644.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.024916S","chronDate":"18-21 Nov. 1991","isNumber":"4411","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"602","articleId":"170644","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":170647,"authors":[{"name":"P.K.

A min-max hyperbox and its membership function define a fuzzy set. Each class in the neural network is a collection of labeled hyperboxes (fuzzy sets). The degree to which an input pattern belongs to a class is determined by the membership function of the winning hyperbox. Using multiple hyperbox fuzzy sets to form classes allows arbitrary numbers and shapes of classes and their respective class boundaries. The min-max classification learning procedure requires only a single pass through the data and allows online learning. The author describes how the fuzzy min-max classifier is implemented as a neural network, explains how min-max classes are produced, and provides two examples of operation.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.1991.170647","startPage":"1658","endPage":"1669 vol.2","displayPublicationTitle":"[Proceedings] 1991 IEEE International Joint Conference on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel2/602/4411/00170647.pdf","publicationTitle":"[Proceedings] 1991 IEEE International Joint Conference on Neural Networks","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.1991.170647","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4411","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fuzzy min-max neural networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fuzzy neural networks","Neural networks","Fuzzy sets","Fuzzy set theory","Fuzzy logic","Supervised learning","Shape","Resonance","Subspace constraints","Unsupervised learning"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fuzzy logic","fuzzy set theory","learning systems","minimax techniques","neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["minimax hyperbox","fuzzy set theory","minimax classification learning","fuzzy minimax neural nets","supervised neural network classifier","fuzzy logic","membership function"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/170647/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 Nov. 1991","displayDocTitle":"Fuzzy min-max neural networks","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1991","dateOfInsertion":"12 September 2019","conferenceDate":"18-21 Nov. 1991","accessionNumber":"4269673","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fuzzy min-max neural networks","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"00170647.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.028168S","chronDate":"18-21 Nov. 1991","isNumber":"4411","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"602","citationCount":"17","articleId":"170647","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":170652,"authors":[{"name":"Y.B.

The trained MLPs are used as the vector quantizer (VQ) in a hidden Markov model (HMM) based speech recognition system. This approach represents an unsupervised learning algorithm for multilayer perceptrons, i.e., the neurons of the output layer do not receive any specific target values during training, but instead the output is learned during training using principles of self-organization. Information theory principles are used as learning criteria for the MLP. When using VQ in a HMM-based speech recognition system, multiple features such as cepstral parameters, differential cepstral parameters, and energy can be used as joint input into the same VQ, thus avoiding the use of multiple codebooks. In this case, the principle of 'sensor fusion' can be transferred to the speech recognition area with same intention, namely using neural networks for merging the output of different information sources in order to obtain an improved feature extractor for more robust pattern recognition.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/170683/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 Nov. 1991","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1991","dateOfInsertion":"12 September 2019","accessionNumber":"4269690","conferenceDate":"18-21 Nov. 1991","displayDocTitle":"A new unsupervised learning algorithm for multilayer perceptrons based on information theory principles","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new unsupervised learning algorithm for multilayer perceptrons based on information theory principles","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"00170683.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.02474S","chronDate":"18-21 Nov. 1991","isNumber":"4411","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"602","articleId":"170683","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":170685,"authors":[{"name":"A.L.

The network reported by the authors in 1990 can make use of other gradient methods. Experiments with the steepest descent/ascent and conjugate gradients algorithms show a potential decrease in the number of iterations. The contours of the network's function showed considerable variation, especially close to the local optima. This nature restricted the line search algorithms that could be used.

An appropriate controller is generated without an exact mathematical model of the dynamics of structure.

The input layer accesses three different time points. The accessing points are determined by the time-warping functions. The input spectrum sequence itself is not warped but the accessing-point sequence is warped. The advantage of this network architecture is that the input layer can access the original spectrum sequence. The proposed network demonstrated higher phoneme recognition accuracy than the baseline recognizer based on conventional feedforward neural networks. The recognition accuracy was even higher than that achieved with discrete hidden Markov models.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.1991.170701","startPage":"2122","endPage":"2127 vol.3","publicationTitle":"[Proceedings] 1991 IEEE International Joint Conference on Neural Networks","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.1991.170701","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4411","displayPublicationTitle":"[Proceedings] 1991 IEEE International Joint Conference on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel2/602/4411/00170701.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Time-warping neural network for phoneme recognition","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/170701/","displayDocTitle":"Time-warping neural network for phoneme recognition","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"4269748","publicationDate":"1991","dateOfInsertion":"12 September 2019","conferenceDate":"18-21 Nov. 1991","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 Nov. 1991","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Time-warping neural network for phoneme recognition","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"00170701.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.031826S","chronDate":"18-21 Nov. 1991","isNumber":"4411","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"602","articleId":"170701","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":170702,"authors":[{"name":"M.

The basic premise is that the neural architectures have evolved and fine tuned themselves for the particular tasks that they perform. Any attempt to duplicate them with an artificial neural system would then perform optimally if it were to use the same, or at least a similar, architecture. The model was trained using the backpropagation rule. The model was able to clearly replicate most of the important retinal functions. The simulations showed that, starting from small random initial values for weights, the network developed connections which were close analogs of the biological systems. The result of this development is an optimal or near optimal set of connections to perform the task.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.1991.170738","pdfPath":"/iel2/602/4411/00170738.pdf","startPage":"2343","endPage":"2348 vol.3","displayPublicationTitle":"[Proceedings] 1991 IEEE International Joint Conference on Neural Networks","publicationTitle":"[Proceedings] 1991 IEEE International Joint Conference on Neural Networks","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.1991.170738","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4411","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On modelling the retina using neural networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/170738/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 Nov. 1991","displayDocTitle":"On modelling the retina using neural networks","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"12 September 2019","accessionNumber":"4274841","publicationDate":"1991","conferenceDate":"18-21 Nov. 1991","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On modelling the retina using neural networks","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"00170738.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.032244S","chronDate":"18-21 Nov. 1991","isNumber":"4411","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"602","articleId":"170738","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":170745,"authors":[{"name":"Y.H.

It was confirmed that all of the solutions are optimum, and that the SDNN processor always converges to global minima without any external one.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.1991.170755","startPage":"2444","endPage":"2449 vol.3","displayPublicationTitle":"[Proceedings] 1991 IEEE International Joint Conference on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel2/602/4411/00170755.pdf","publicationTitle":"[Proceedings] 1991 IEEE International Joint Conference on Neural Networks","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.1991.170755","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4411","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"SDNN-3: A simple processor architecture for O(1) parallel processing in combinatorial optimization with strictly digital neural networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Parallel processing","Neural networks","Computer networks","Hopfield neural networks","Computational modeling","Power system modeling","Neurons","Hardware","NP-complete problem","Stochastic processes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","neural nets","optimisation","parallel architectures"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["time complexity","SDNN-3","parallel processing","combinatorial optimization","digital neural networks","strictly digital neural networks","hypercube","large-scale N-queen problems"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/170755/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 Nov. 1991","displayDocTitle":"SDNN-3: A simple processor architecture for O(1) parallel processing in combinatorial optimization with strictly digital neural networks","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1991","dateOfInsertion":"12 September 2019","conferenceDate":"18-21 Nov. 1991","accessionNumber":"4274858","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"SDNN-3: A simple processor architecture for O(1) parallel processing in combinatorial optimization with strictly digital neural networks","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"00170755.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058375S","chronDate":"18-21 Nov. 1991","isNumber":"4411","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"602","citationCount":"9","articleId":"170755","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":170771,"authors":[{"name":"N.

One method, the direct inverse control error approach, is effective for small adjustments of the neural controller when it is already reasonably trained; another, the predicted output error approach, directly minimizes the control error and greatly improves convergence of the controller.

The hardware consists mainly of a workstation computer, a receiver/pulser with gated peak detector, various monitoring devices, a microcomputer-based 3D positioning controller, and an A/D converter. The characterization algorithms are based on neural network and pattern recognition techniques. It is found that artificial neural network techniques provide far better classification results than the pattern recognition techniques. A multilayer backpropagation neural network which provides a classification accuracy of 94% is developed. Two other multilayer neural networks-sum-of-products and a newly devised neural network called hybrid sum-of-products-have a classification accuracy of 90% and 93%, respectively. The most successful pattern recognition technique for this application is found to be the perceptron, which provides a classification accuracy of 77%.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/41.170972","startPage":"529","endPage":"536","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel1/41/4417/00170972.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/41.170972","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4417","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Methodologies for characterizing ultrasonic transducers using neural network and pattern recognition techniques","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Ultrasonic transducers","Artificial neural networks","Multi-layer neural network","Pattern recognition","Neural networks","Hardware","Data acquisition","Software algorithms","Workstations","Detectors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neural nets","ultrasonic transducers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ultrasonic transducers","neural network","pattern recognition","data acquisition software","characterizing algorithms","workstation computer","receiver/pulser","gated peak detector","microcomputer-based 3D positioning controller","A/D converter"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/170972/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1992","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1992","displayDocTitle":"Methodologies for characterizing ultrasonic transducers using neural network and pattern recognition techniques","volume":"39","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 1992","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4337658","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Methodologies for characterizing ultrasonic transducers using neural network and pattern recognition techniques","sourcePdf":"00170972.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.06995S","chronDate":"Dec 1992","isNumber":"4417","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"10","articleId":"170972","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":170973,"authors":[{"name":"K.

The rich array of technologies that are being pursued is surveyed, and the analog CMOS VLSI medium approach is focused on. This medium is messy in that limited dynamic range, offset voltages, and noise sources all reduce precision. The authors examine how neural networks can be directly implemented in analog VLSI, giving examples of approaches that have been pursued to date. Two important application areas are highlighted: optimization, because neural hardware may offer a speed advantage of orders of magnitude over other methods; and supervised learning, because of the widespread use and generality of gradient-descent learning algorithms as applied to feedforward networks.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analog VLSI neural networks: implementation issues and examples in optimization and supervised learning","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","doi":"10.1109/41.170975","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel1/41/4417/00170975.pdf","startPage":"552","endPage":"564","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/41.170975","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4417","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=170975","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/170975/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1992","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1992","displayDocTitle":"Analog VLSI neural networks: implementation issues and examples in optimization and supervised learning","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"39","issue":"6","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Dec. 1992","accessionNumber":"4337661","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analog VLSI neural networks: implementation issues and examples in optimization and supervised learning","sourcePdf":"00170975.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.071622S","chronDate":"Dec 1992","isNumber":"4417","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"19","articleId":"170975","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":170976,"authors":[{"name":"A.

The characterization of the multiconductor system is based on full-wave analysis using the spectral domain approach, rather than the usual TEM approximation. To compute the transient response of such a system, a bilevel waveform relaxation method is used. Waveform relaxation is applied to compute a time-domain solution at the input and output interfaces. The waveforms are then transformed into the frequency domain to compute the updates induced by the multiconductor system and are transformed back to the time domain for the next set of relaxation at the interfaces. Techniques for convergence are discussed. Examples of ECL, CMOS, and GaAs circuits connected by coupled lines are given for illustration.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/43.170989","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","startPage":"1258","endPage":"1277","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel1/43/4418/00170989.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/43.170989","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4418","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Transient analysis of dispersive VLSI interconnects terminated in nonlinear loads","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Transient analysis","Dispersion","Very large scale integration","Transient response","Computer interfaces","Integrated circuit interconnections","Couplings","Spectral analysis","Relaxation methods","Time domain analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["convergence of numerical methods","relaxation theory","spectral-domain analysis","transient response","VLSI"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["nonlinear load termination","coupled multiconductor system","dispersive VLSI interconnects","transient response","full-wave analysis","spectral domain approach","bilevel waveform relaxation","time-domain solution","frequency domain","convergence","ECL","CMOS","GaAs circuits"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1992","displayDocTitle":"Transient analysis of dispersive VLSI interconnects terminated in nonlinear loads","volume":"11","issue":"10","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4331804","publicationDate":"Oct. 1992","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1992","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/170989/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Transient analysis of dispersive VLSI interconnects terminated in nonlinear loads","sourcePdf":"00170989.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.04547S","chronDate":"Oct 1992","isNumber":"4418","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","citationCount":"29","articleId":"170989","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":170991,"authors":[{"name":"S.-Y.

The array consists of identical elements such as processors or memory cells embedded in a switch lattice in the form of a rectangular grid, in contrast to the redundancy approach in which some elements are dedicated as spares, all the elements in the degradation approach are treated in a uniform way. Each element can be either fault-free or defective, and a subarray which contains no faulty element is derived under constraints of switching and routing mechanisms. Although extensive literature exists concerning spare allocation and reconfiguration in arrays with redundancy, little research has been published on optimal reconfiguration in a degradable array. A graph formulation is used to describe the problem, and reconfiguration is found to relate to finding an independent set of a graph. Efficient heuristic algorithms are presented to determine a target subarray from the defective host array.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/170991/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1992","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1992","volume":"11","issue":"10","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 1992","accessionNumber":"4331806","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","displayDocTitle":"Efficient reconfiguration algorithms for degradable VLSI/WSI arrays","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient reconfiguration algorithms for degradable VLSI/WSI arrays","sourcePdf":"00170991.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.035587S","chronDate":"Oct 1992","isNumber":"4418","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","citationCount":"72","articleId":"170991","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":171091,"authors":[{"name":"M.L.

The reduction of feature size and the possibility of obtaining vias and conductors at the same pitch allow increased density and wiring flexibility. However, vias crossing through several levels at fixed positions reduce connectivity to such an extent that they occupy two places on each metal level with conventional technology. Design considerations for improving the density and processing in order to obtain stacked vias are discussed. It is shown that a judicious distribution of fixed trough vias allows a reduction of the pitch of the chips. In addition, when stacked vias are possible, the space, needed for vias is reduced by almost 30%, leaving better availability for wiring.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","publicationTitle":"8th IEEE/CHMT International Conference on Electronic Manufacturing Technology Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"8th IEEE/CHMT International Conference on Electronic Manufacturing Technology Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel2/127/4421/00171091.pdf","startPage":"73","endPage":"81","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IEMT8.1990.171091","doi":"10.1109/IEMT8.1990.171091","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4421","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"New technologies to improve density on multichip modules","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"New technologies to improve density on multichip modules","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/171091/","conferenceDate":"7-9 May 1990","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1990","accessionNumber":"4067322","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"0-0  1990","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"New technologies to improve density on multichip modules","confLoc":"Baveno, Italy","sourcePdf":"00171091.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061086S","chronDate":"0-0  1990","isNumber":"4421","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"127","citationCount":"2","articleId":"171091","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":171167,"authors":[{"name":"G.

Because of the significant collector-base feedback time constant, the cascode configuration provides a large improvement in amplifier bandwidth, but a low-impedance bias node must be provided for the common-base transistor. An active bias network was thus used. The resulting 33-GHz amplifier bandwidth (and predicted noise figure) is competitive with AlGaAs/GaAs MODFET travelling-wave amplifiers, but with a much smaller die area (excluding bond pads) of 200 mu m*225 mu m. The AlInAs/GaInAs monolithic feedback amplifiers are extremely small, wideband gain blocks suitable for use as subcomponents in complex MMICs and MIMICs.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Heterojunctions","Bandwidth","Feedback amplifiers","Broadband amplifiers","Noise figure","Gallium arsenide","MODFETs","HEMTs","Bonding","MMICs"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["aluminium compounds","bipolar integrated circuits","feedback","gallium arsenide","heterojunction bipolar transistors","III-V semiconductors","indium compounds","microwave amplifiers","MMIC","wideband amplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["HBT","MM-wave type","heterojunction bipolar transistor","cascode configuration","low-impedance bias node","common-base transistor","active bias network","monolithic feedback amplifiers","wideband gain blocks","MMICs","MIMICs","70 GHz","90 GHz","33 GHz","8.6 dB","AlInAs-GaInAs"]}],"doi":"10.1109/BIPOL.1990.171177","publicationTitle":"Proceedings on Bipolar Circuits and Technology Meeting","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings on Bipolar Circuits and Technology Meeting","pdfPath":"/iel2/156/4422/00171177.pdf","startPage":"252","endPage":"255","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4422","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/BIPOL.1990.171177","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"33 GHz monolithic cascode AlInAs/GaInAs heterojunction bipolar transistor feedback amplifier","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=171177","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"33 GHz monolithic cascode AlInAs/GaInAs heterojunction bipolar transistor feedback amplifier","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/171177/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1990","accessionNumber":"4106382","conferenceDate":"17-18 Sept. 1990","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-18 Sep 1990","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"33 GHz monolithic cascode AlInAs/GaInAs heterojunction bipolar transistor feedback amplifier","confLoc":"Minneapolis, MN, USA","sourcePdf":"00171177.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069619S","chronDate":"17-18 Sep 1990","isNumber":"4422","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"156","citationCount":"17","articleId":"171177","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":171302,"authors":[{"name":"M.

The first, the measurement software, allows the measurement of a large number of frequency samples with an HP8753 network analyzer. The second package, the data manipulation software, is more specialized in that it is only applicable to measured S-parameters from a special five-transducer test structure.

While all material constants of LiBnO/sub 3/ and most of LiTaO/sub 3/ have reasonable error bounds, further improvements are expected from more accurately measured unclamped permittivities.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Symposium on Ultrasonics","pdfPath":"/iel2/169/4424/00171403.pdf","startPage":"435","endPage":"438 vol.1","publicationTitle":"IEEE Symposium on Ultrasonics","doi":"10.1109/ULTSYM.1990.171403","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ULTSYM.1990.171403","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4424","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=171403","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improved material constants for LiNbO/sub 3/ and LiTaO/sub 3/","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Surface acoustic waves","Velocity measurement","Dielectric materials","Dielectric measurements","Dielectric substrates","Surface acoustic wave devices","Crystalline materials","Research and development","Piezoelectric devices","Least squares methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["lithium compounds","permittivity","piezoelectric materials","surface acoustic waves","ultrasonic velocity"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["SAW velocities","piezoelectric","dielectric constants","material constants","metallized substrates","mechanical loading","trigonometric expansions","unclamped permittivities","LiNbO/sub 3/","LiTaO/sub 3/"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/171403/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-7 Dec 1990","displayDocTitle":"Improved material constants for LiNbO/sub 3/ and LiTaO/sub 3/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1990","accessionNumber":"4091069","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"4-7 Dec. 1990","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improved material constants for LiNbO/sub 3/ and LiTaO/sub 3/","confLoc":"Honolulu, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"00171403.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.028799S","chronDate":"4-7 Dec 1990","isNumber":"4424","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"169","citationCount":"189","articleId":"171403","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":171417,"authors":[{"name":"D.S.

The analysis is applicable to multilayer structures with periodic discontinuities in characteristic impedance. It is shown that the frequency response of such structures is approximately equal to the discrete-time Fourier transform of the individual-layer reflection coefficients. The synthesis procedure uses the inverse transform to generate a sequence of layer characteristic impedances. Using this method, high transformation ratios over wide bandwidths can be obtained. A numerical example, using PZT-5A and water, is presented. The matching layer impedances generated by the Fourier synthesis procedure are then analyzed using an ideal transmission line model. The results of the analysis agree well with the predicted results of the synthesis procedure, indicating the validity of the approximations used to arrive at this method.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ULTSYM.1990.171429","publicationTitle":"IEEE Symposium on Ultrasonics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Symposium on Ultrasonics","pdfPath":"/iel2/169/4424/00171429.pdf","startPage":"581","endPage":"586 vol.1","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ULTSYM.1990.171429","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4424","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Acoustic matching network synthesis using discrete space Fourier transforms","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=171429","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-7 Dec 1990","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/171429/","displayDocTitle":"Acoustic matching network synthesis using discrete space Fourier transforms","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1990","accessionNumber":"4101619","conferenceDate":"4-7 Dec. 1990","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Acoustic matching network synthesis using discrete space Fourier transforms","confLoc":"Honolulu, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"00171429.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072244S","chronDate":"4-7 Dec 1990","isNumber":"4424","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"169","citationCount":"4","articleId":"171429","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":171470,"authors":[{"name":"C.M.W.

This equation in combination with backscatter from a J/sub 0/ Bessel nondiffracting beam results in the ability to calculate backscatter coefficients in real time. In addition, estimations of the backscatter coefficients are more distance-independent because of the nonspreading nature of the J/sub 0/ Bessel nondiffracting beam.

Large differences in scattering were found between measurements made in the direction along the axis of the artery (axial) and radially out from the center of the artery (radial). Scattering (at 50 MHz) in the media of carotid arteries increased from 0.003 (Steradian (Sr)-mm)/sup -1/ (axial) to 0.4 (Sr-mm)/sup -1/ (radial). Scattering was found to be higher in elastic arteries (carotid) than in the muscular arteries (femoral). In the media, the average scatter (radial direction, 50 MHz) varied from 0.002 (Sr-mm)/sup -1/ in muscular arteries to 0.4 (Sr-mm)/sup -1/ in elastic arteries. The average attenuation in the artery wall increased from 4 dB/mm at 30 MHz to 10 dB/mm at 60 MHz. In blood, attenuation increased from 1.6 dB/mm to 5 dB/mm over the same frequency range.

Mead and M.A. Mahowald (1988); a method of echo inversion described by N.H. Farhat and B. Bai (1989); and the fingerprint recognition method of M.-T. Leung et al. (1990). Mead's work is significant because it forms a front-end for image analysis with a morphology modeled on the eye. Farhat's group has down work on the use of neural networks in image reconstruction. A description of some of this is included because it concerns the regularization of an inverse problem, which is similar to many ultrasonic, medical, and geophysical imaging applications. The method of M.-T. Leung et al. is noteworthy not only as an example of neuromorphic image processing, but also because the representation of the data is inspired by measurements of the mammalian brain. Current areas of research in ultrasonic applications of neural networks are discussed.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-7 Dec 1990","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/171601/","accessionNumber":"4096726","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1990","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"4-7 Dec. 1990","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Neural networks for image analysis","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Neural networks for image analysis","confLoc":"Honolulu, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"00171601.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04099S","chronDate":"4-7 Dec 1990","isNumber":"4424","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"169","articleId":"171601","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":171603,"authors":[{"name":"B.

This approach has been compared with the traditional reconfiguration algorithms, and by intensive simulation it is shown that the proposed neural net approach provides superior quality performance (i.e., higher survivability rates). It is also shown that the intrinsic fault-tolerant nature of neural networks maintains a degradable reconfiguration control even in the presence of faulty neural network components.

A procedure for automatically selecting feature sets which best represent the distinction between different classes of solder joints, based on a modified version of the Karhunen-Loeve transform applied to images, is summarized. The results of applying artificial neural network classification techniques to coefficients produced by this procedure in the above inspection task are presented.

The maximum annual equivalent salt deposit density (ESDD) and nonsoluble deposit density (NDD) on insulator surfaces were 0.038-0.057 mg/cm/sup 2/ and 0.144-0.425 mg/cm/sup 2/, respectively, in winter or early spring. The contamination on the surface of a DC energized insulator was 20% more than that of an AC energized one. When contaminants grew markedly, the top surface of the insulators attracted more contaminants than the bottom surface, especially in the case of aerodynamic and outside rib type insulators. There has been a heavy decrease in the contamination degree of insulators after the rainy season.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/172070/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 Jul 1991","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"8-12 July 1991","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1991","accessionNumber":"4264218","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Natural contamination test results of various insulators under DC voltage in an inland area in China","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Natural contamination test results of various insulators under DC voltage in an inland area in China","confLoc":"Tokyo, Japan","sourcePdf":"00172070.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.038213S","chronDate":"8-12 Jul 1991","isNumber":"4432","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"500","citationCount":"5","articleId":"172070","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":172396,"authors":[{"name":"B.

Using ICE makes it possible to check battery cells by using a simple digital voltmeter, when cell voltages deviate by more than +or-0.05 V per cell and capacity testing or replacement is required. ICE was designed to monitor and control individual cells in stationary battery strings. ICE monitors cell voltages and acts as current shunt by allowing current to bypass cells with high voltages. Conversely, current will pass through low voltage cells to bring voltage back to the current level. ICE was designed with limited shunting ability. Thus, weak cells are identified before failure.

Signal delay versus clock frequency has been measured from 1 MHz to 13 GHz, verifying CCD operation. The input-to-output transfer function is linear for input powers ranging from -25 dBm to +2 dBm, with a 1 dB compression point at 4.5 dBm. The lower bound on CTE is 0.995 at 10 MHz and 4.02 GHz. CTE characterization results for clock frequencies between 4.02 GHz to 16.4 GHz qualitatively agree with those of two-dimensional transient simulations, which show that the charge packet transfers at saturation velocity. Simulations of a device incorporating an InGaAs channel predict that CTE greater than 0.9999 is attainable for clock frequencies up to 50 GHz.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Clocks","Charge coupled devices","Gallium arsenide","Predictive models","Indium gallium arsenide","Bandwidth","Frequency measurement","Transfer functions","Propagation delay","Charge-coupled image sensors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["charge-coupled device circuits","charge-coupled devices","signal processing equipment","solid-state microwave devices"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["two-phase CCD","microwave 2DEG-CCD","high speed signal acquisition","clock frequency","transfer function","saturation velocity","1 MHz to 50 GHz","InGaAs channel"]}],"doi":"10.1109/GAAS.1991.172624","publicationTitle":"[1991] GaAs IC Symposium Technical Digest","displayPublicationTitle":"[1991] GaAs IC Symposium Technical Digest","pdfPath":"/iel2/594/4435/00172624.pdf","startPage":"23","endPage":"26","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4435","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GAAS.1991.172624","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A microwave 2DEG-CCD for high speed signal acquisition","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=172624","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A microwave 2DEG-CCD for high speed signal acquisition","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/172624/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1991","accessionNumber":"4239557","conferenceDate":"20-23 Oct. 1991","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-23 Oct. 1991","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A microwave 2DEG-CCD for high speed signal acquisition","confLoc":"Monterey, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00172624.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047384S","chronDate":"20-23 Oct. 1991","isNumber":"4435","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"594","citationCount":"4","articleId":"172624","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":172629,"authors":[{"name":"R.

By a comparison with infrared thermal imaging, the use of the average junction temperature is shown to provide an accurate thermal resistance figure for conventional IC package structures.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Development and application of test chips and test systems for the thermal characteristics of IC packaging technologies","publicationTitle":"[1992 Proceedings] Eighth Annual IEEE Semiconductor Thermal Measurement and Management Symposium","doi":"10.1109/STHERM.1992.172867","displayPublicationTitle":"[1992 Proceedings] Eighth Annual IEEE Semiconductor Thermal Measurement and Management Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel2/619/4437/00172867.pdf","startPage":"47","endPage":"54","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/STHERM.1992.172867","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4437","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=172867","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/172867/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 Feb 1992","displayDocTitle":"Development and application of test chips and test systems for the thermal characteristics of IC packaging technologies","conferenceDate":"3-5 Feb. 1992","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1992","accessionNumber":"4254772","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Development and application of test chips and test systems for the thermal characteristics of IC packaging technologies","confLoc":"Austin, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"00172867.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.038797S","chronDate":"3-5 Feb 1992","isNumber":"4437","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"619","citationCount":"9","articleId":"172867","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":173091,"authors":[{"name":"J. van Valburg","affiliation":["Philips Research Laboratories, Eindhoven, Netherlands"],"firstName":"J.","lastName":"van Valburg","id":"37388934600"},{"name":"R.J. van de Plassche","affiliation":["Philips Research Laboratories, Eindhoven, Netherlands"],"firstName":"R.J.","lastName":"van de Plassche","id":"37275705700"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9200"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-173X"}],"articleNumber":"173091","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":82,"citationCountPatent":8,"totalDownloads":759},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Solid-State Circuits Society","url":"http://ewh.ieee.org/soc/sscs/index.php"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Voltage","Energy consumption","Sampling methods","Error correction","Signal sampling","Frequency conversion","Quantization","Digital-analog conversion","Power amplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["analogue-digital conversion","bipolar integrated circuits","error correction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["8 bit resolution","A/D convertor","monolithic IC","folding ADC","analog error correction","comparators","triple-level interconnect bipolar process","650 MHz","1 micron","850 mW","-4.5 V"]}],"abstract":"An 8-b 650-MHz folding analog-to-digital converter (ADC) with analog error correction in the comparators is presented.

Moreover, with conversion rates approaching half those of fully parallel designs, such half-flash architectures provide both a relatively small input capacitance and low power dissipation. The authors describe the design of a 12-b 5-Msample/s A/D converter that is based on a two-step flash topology and has been integrated in a 1- mu m CMOS technology. Configured as a fully differential circuit, the converter performs a 7-b coarse flash conversion followed by a 6-b fine flash conversion. Both analog and digital error correction are used to achieve a resolution of 12 b. The converter dissipates only 200 mW from a single 5-V supply and occupies an area of 2.5 mm * 3.7 mm.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel1/4/4442/00173092.pdf","startPage":"1667","endPage":"1678","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","doi":"10.1109/4.173092","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/4.173092","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4442","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=173092","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A 12-b 5-Msample/s two-step CMOS A/D converter","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["CMOS technology","Operational amplifiers","Capacitance","Power dissipation","Error correction","Timing","Analog-digital conversion","Circuit topology","Integrated circuit technology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["analogue-digital conversion","CMOS integrated circuits","error correction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["two-step ADC","12 bit-resolution","A/D converter","flash architectures","high-speed","high-resolution","half-flash architectures","two-step flash topology","CMOS technology","fully differential circuit","coarse flash conversion","fine flash conversion","error correction","single 5-V supply","5 V","200 mW","1 micron"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/173092/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1992","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1992","displayDocTitle":"A 12-b 5-Msample/s two-step CMOS A/D converter","volume":"27","issue":"12","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 1992","accessionNumber":"4338265","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A 12-b 5-Msample/s two-step CMOS A/D converter","sourcePdf":"00173092.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.031085S","chronDate":"Dec 1992","isNumber":"4442","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"49","articleId":"173092","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":173094,"authors":[{"name":"D.A.

The chip has been fabricated in a standard 1.5- mu m n-well CMOS process.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/4.173114","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel1/4/4442/00173114.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/4.173114","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4442","startPage":"1843","endPage":"1853","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A 10.7-MHz 68-dB SNR CMOS continuous-time filter with on-chip automatic tuning","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=173114","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A 10.7-MHz 68-dB SNR CMOS continuous-time filter with on-chip automatic tuning","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1992","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/173114/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1992","isJournal":true,"volume":"27","issue":"12","publicationDate":"Dec. 1992","accessionNumber":"4338287","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A 10.7-MHz 68-dB SNR CMOS continuous-time filter with on-chip automatic tuning","sourcePdf":"00173114.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.038364S","chronDate":"Dec 1992","isNumber":"4442","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"116","articleId":"173114","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":173115,"authors":[{"name":"Y.

The architecture of the add-compare-select (ACS) array is based on a restructuring of the conventional radix-2 trellis into a radix-4 trellis. Radix-4 units, consisting of four 4-way ACS units, process two stages of the constituent radix-2 trellis per iteration. A four-way ACS circuit achieves an iteration delay 17% longer than comparable two-way ACS circuits, resulting in a factor of 1.7 increase in throughput. A ring-based ACS placement and state metric routing topology achieves an area efficiency comparable to radix-2 designs. In a process referred to as pretrace-back, one stage of lookahead is applied to the trace-back recursion, combining two radix-4 trace-back iterations into a single radix-16 iteration based on 4-b decisions. This allows implementation of trace-back using one compact, single-ported decision memory, organized as a cyclic buffer. A 7.30-mm*8.49-mm chip containing 146000 transistors achieves a radix-4 iteration rate of 70 MHz.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/4.173118","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel1/4/4442/00173118.pdf","startPage":"1877","endPage":"1885","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/4.173118","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4442","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A 140-Mb/s, 32-state, radix-4 Viterbi decoder","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1992","displayDocTitle":"A 140-Mb/s, 32-state, radix-4 Viterbi decoder","volume":"27","issue":"12","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4338291","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 1992","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/173118/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1992","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A 140-Mb/s, 32-state, radix-4 Viterbi decoder","sourcePdf":"00173118.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.040896S","chronDate":"Dec 1992","isNumber":"4442","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"155","articleId":"173118","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":173119,"authors":[{"name":"K.

As a digital implementation, the DCDD is as manufacturable as conventional CMOS digital circuits, unlike decoders based on analog phase-locked loops, which are sensitive to CMOS processing parameters and are, hence, difficult to manufacture. A 32-tap synchronous delay line (SDL) provides the timing reference for the DCDD with a resolution equivalent to that provided by a 320-MHz clock. This phase information is used to digitally recover, using waveform synthesis performed at a 320-MHz rate, the clock and data information from the input data. The DCDD meets the jitter-tolerance requirements of the CSMA/CD standard with the consistency demanded of a commercial integrated circuit.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/4.173124","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel1/4/4442/00173124.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/4.173124","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4442","startPage":"1934","endPage":"1940","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A novel CMOS digital clock and data decoder","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=173124","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A novel CMOS digital clock and data decoder","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1992","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/173124/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1992","isJournal":true,"volume":"27","issue":"12","publicationDate":"Dec. 1992","accessionNumber":"4338297","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A novel CMOS digital clock and data decoder","sourcePdf":"00173124.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.058175S","chronDate":"Dec 1992","isNumber":"4442","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"17","articleId":"173124","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":173144,"authors":[{"name":"A.M.

The novelty of this result lies in the fact that the uncertainty bounds needed to derive the control law and to prove uniform ultimate boundedness of the tracking error depend only on the inertial parameters of the robot. In previous results of this type, the uncertainty bounds have depended not only on the inertia parameters but also on the reference trajectory and on the manipulator state vector. The presented result also removes previous assumptions regarding closeness in norm of the computed inertia matrix to the actual inertial matrix. The design used thus provides the simplest such robust design available to date.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1992","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/173151/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1992","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4355260","volume":"37","issue":"11","publicationDate":"Nov. 1992","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"On the robust control of robot manipulators","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the robust control of robot manipulators","sourcePdf":"00173151.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.042975S","chronDate":"Nov 1992","isNumber":"4443","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9","citationCount":"270","articleId":"173151","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":173153,"authors":[{"name":"C.C. de Wit","affiliation":["Laboratoire dAutomatique de Grenoble, URA CNRS 228, ENSIEG-INPG, Saint Martin d'Heres, France"],"firstName":"C.C.","lastName":"de Wit","id":"37371048700"},{"name":"O.J.

The geometric point response functions are shown to be shift-invariant for these three collimators if the distance between the point source and the detection plane is constant. For single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), this property is used in the projector/backprojector to correct for geometric distortion using the iterative EM reconstruction algorithm. In the implementation, the system geometric response, the crystal intrinsic response and the attenuation were compensated. The attenuation compensation was accomplished in the spatial domain. The point response corrections were accomplished using frequency domain filtering, taking advantage of the shift-invariance of the system point response function at a fixed depth. The frequency domain implementation significantly speeded up the algorithm. Phantom studies showed the increase of resolution and the reduction of density nonuniformity artifacts which were due to the spatially varying system response function and the attenuation effect.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4444","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/23.173222","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","pdfPath":"/iel1/23/4444/00173222.pdf","startPage":"1444","endPage":"1453","doi":"10.1109/23.173222","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Frequency domain implementation of the three-dimensional geometric point response correction in SPECT imaging","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  1992","displayDocTitle":"Frequency domain implementation of the three-dimensional geometric point response correction in SPECT imaging","volume":"39","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 1992","accessionNumber":"4349886","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/173222/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct.  1992","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Frequency domain implementation of the three-dimensional geometric point response correction in SPECT imaging","sourcePdf":"00173222.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.069538S","chronDate":"Oct.  1992","isNumber":"4444","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"83","articleId":"173222","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":173225,"authors":[{"name":"J.A.

Gated resistors are actively clocked polysilicon resistors that are used to provide single-event upset (SEU) hardness. they are placed in the cross-coupled segments of SRAM cells, similar to designs using passive polysilicon resistors. The high-resistance OFF-state of the gated resistors protects the stored cell data from SEUs. However, during write-cell cycles, the gated resistors are clocked into a low-resistance ON-state by a wordline clock signal. The resultant low-resistance current paths reduce the charging time constants of the internal cell nodes, thus preserving the fast write response to the cell. Experimental investigations of gated resistor technology demonstrated the processing capability and device feasibility. The gated resistor process was found to be easy to integrate into a radiation-hardened half-micrometer CMOS process without introducing any process complexities and without negatively affecting functional yield or degrading total dose hardness.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/23.173239","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","pdfPath":"/iel1/23/4444/00173239.pdf","startPage":"1532","endPage":"1541","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/23.173239","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4444","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Simulated SEU hardened scaled CMOS SRAM cell design using gated resistors","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/173239/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct.  1992","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  1992","displayDocTitle":"Simulated SEU hardened scaled CMOS SRAM cell design using gated resistors","volume":"39","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 1992","accessionNumber":"4338361","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Simulated SEU hardened scaled CMOS SRAM cell design using gated resistors","sourcePdf":"00173239.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.050689S","chronDate":"Oct.  1992","isNumber":"4444","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"35","articleId":"173239","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":173326,"authors":[{"name":"S.

Then, a new kind of vertex graph called MAKLINK is constructed to support the generation of a collision free path. This graph is constructed using the midpoints of common free links between free convex area as passing points. These points correspond to nodes in a graph and the connection between them within each convex area as arcs in this graph. A collision free path can be efficiently generated using the MAKLINK graph. The complexity of the search for a collision free path is greatly reduced by minimizing the size of the graph to be searched concerning the number of nodes and the number of arcs connecting them. The analysis of the proposed algorithm shows its efficiency in terms of computation ability, safety, optimality, and in supporting robot navigation along the generated path.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 Nov 1991","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/174534/","accessionNumber":"4203749","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1991","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"3-5 Nov. 1991","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Efficient method to generate collision free paths for an autonomous mobile robot based on new free space structuring approach","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient method to generate collision free paths for an autonomous mobile robot based on new free space structuring approach","confLoc":"Osaka, Japan","sourcePdf":"00174534.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.036283S","chronDate":"3-5 Nov 1991","isNumber":"4454","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"561","citationCount":"46","articleId":"174534","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":174585,"authors":[{"name":"C.

The obstacle avoidance strategy is to plan the shortest collision-free path between each pair of n locations in 2D or in 3D. The TSP strategy is to compute a minimal system cost of a tour that is defined as a closed path navigating each location exactly once. The TSP strategy can be implemented by the neural network. The obstacle avoidance strategy can be implemented by the optimal edges by the modified genetic algorithm and computes the optimal nodes along the optimal edges by the recursive compensation algorithm.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/IROS.1991.174586","startPage":"824","endPage":"828 vol.2","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings IROS '91:IEEE/RSJ International Workshop on Intelligent Robots and Systems '91","pdfPath":"/iel2/561/4454/00174586.pdf","publicationTitle":"Proceedings IROS '91:IEEE/RSJ International Workshop on Intelligent Robots and Systems '91","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IROS.1991.174586","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4454","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Neural network application to the obstacle avoidance path planning for CIM computer integrated manufacturing","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Application software","Path planning","Computer integrated manufacturing","Computer networks","Robot kinematics","Navigation","Genetic algorithms","Orbital robotics","Euclidean distance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithms","industrial robots","manufacturing computer control","minimisation","mobile robots","neural nets","planning (artificial intelligence)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neural network","3D path planning","obstacle avoidance path planning","CIM","computer integrated manufacturing","optimal motion","shortest collision-free path","path coordinator","traveling salesman problem","minimal system cost","modified genetic algorithm","recursive compensation algorithm"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/174586/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 Nov 1991","displayDocTitle":"Neural network application to the obstacle avoidance path planning for CIM computer integrated manufacturing","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1991","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"3-5 Nov. 1991","accessionNumber":"4209110","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Neural network application to the obstacle avoidance path planning for CIM computer integrated manufacturing","confLoc":"Osaka, Japan","sourcePdf":"00174586.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04253S","chronDate":"3-5 Nov 1991","isNumber":"4454","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"561","citationCount":"1","articleId":"174586","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":174602,"authors":[{"name":"Y.

When using ultrasonic sensing, to overcome this issue the authors equip the vehicle with multiple servo-mounted sonar sensors, to provide a means in which a subset of environment features can be precisely learned from the robot's initial location and subsequently tracked to provide precise positioning.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/IROS.1991.174711","publicationTitle":"Proceedings IROS '91:IEEE/RSJ International Workshop on Intelligent Robots and Systems '91","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings IROS '91:IEEE/RSJ International Workshop on Intelligent Robots and Systems '91","pdfPath":"/iel2/561/4454/00174711.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IROS.1991.174711","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4454","startPage":"1442","endPage":"1447 vol.3","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Simultaneous map building and localization for an autonomous mobile robot","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=174711","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Simultaneous map building and localization for an autonomous mobile robot","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 Nov 1991","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/174711/","conferenceDate":"3-5 Nov. 1991","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1991","accessionNumber":"4214157","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Simultaneous map building and localization for an autonomous mobile robot","confLoc":"Osaka, Japan","sourcePdf":"00174711.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.03949S","chronDate":"3-5 Nov 1991","isNumber":"4454","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"561","citationCount":"354","articleId":"174711","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":174712,"authors":[{"name":"Wu Wen","affiliation":["Department of Engineering Science, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK"],"lastName":"Wu Wen","id":"37087633207"},{"name":"H.F.

The sensor system is mounted on the end of an ADEPT robot arm and measurements are taken while the robot arm follows a pre-determined trajectory. The methodology is continuous estimation by tracking through prediction and observation. A sensor model and partial knowledge of the environment geometry is essential. The extended Kalman filter algorithm is used to recursively estimate the location of certain objects relative to the robot arm and the uncertainty of measurements and estimation process are also maintained. Optimal sensing strategies consisting of straight line motions are proposed based on effectiveness of uncertainty reduction. An implementation of the system as a hole finder for automatic freight container handling is investigated. Experimental results are presented together with simulated data. Utilisation of geometric constraints in localisation and estimation is discussed.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/174712/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 Nov 1991","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"3-5 Nov. 1991","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1991","accessionNumber":"4214158","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Model based active object localisation using multiple sensors","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Model based active object localisation using multiple sensors","confLoc":"Osaka, Japan","sourcePdf":"00174712.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060379S","chronDate":"3-5 Nov 1991","isNumber":"4454","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"561","citationCount":"7","articleId":"174712","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":174763,"authors":[{"name":"H.

(Scientia Sinica, vol.XXVII, no.10, p.1065, 1984) for finite difference time-domain analysis have been shown to yield excellent results in scalar as well as vector electromagnetics problems using double-precision arithmetic. However, it is more desirable to use single-precision arithmetic if possible, since the time required to perform a real, double-precision multiplication is two to three times that of a single-precision operation. But with a single-precision implementation, it is observed that the solution becomes unstable as the number of time steps grows.

The vector potential is a spatial convolution of the free-space Green's function and the contrast source over the domain of interest. A weak form of the integral equation for the unknown electric flux density is obtained by testing it with roof-top functions. As the next step, the vector potential is expanded in a sequence of the roof-top functions and the grad-div operator is integrated analytically over the dielectric object domain only. Numerical results are presented for a lossy dielectric coaxially layered cylinder. The method considered shows excellent numerical performance.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/APS.1991.175199","publicationTitle":"Antennas and Propagation Society Symposium 1991 Digest","startPage":"1760","endPage":"1763 vol.3","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APS.1991.175199","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4455","pdfPath":"/iel2/581/4455/00175199.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"Antennas and Propagation Society Symposium 1991 Digest","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Tellurium","Electromagnetic scattering","Integral equations","Dielectrics","Testing","Fourier transforms","Permittivity","Fast Fourier transforms","Green's function methods","Laboratories"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["conjugate gradient methods","electromagnetic wave scattering","fast Fourier transforms","Green's function methods","integral equations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["2D transverse electric scattering","electromagnetic scattering","conjugate gradient FFT method","dielectric object","hypersingular integral equation","grad-div operator","vector potential","spatial convolution","free-space Green's function","electric flux density","roof-top functions","lossy dielectric coaxially layered cylinder"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"An improved conjugate gradient FFT method for 2-D TE scattering problems","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/175199/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"4233883","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1991","conferenceDate":"24-28 June 1991","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 June 1991","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An improved conjugate gradient FFT method for 2-D TE scattering problems","confLoc":"London, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"00175199.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051657S","chronDate":"24-28 June 1991","isNumber":"4455","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"581","articleId":"175199","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":175201,"authors":[{"name":"J.-F.

Most of the discussion concerns the dense interstellar medium where stars are forming, with some work presented on nearby galaxies. Extremely sensitive receivers, large accurate telescopes, and high-mountain, airborne, or space platforms are gradually being developed, so that information is steadily improving in quality and scope. Examples are given of line surveys of heavy molecule spectra, extending from millimeter wavelengths well into the submillimeter, of light molecule spectroscopy, and of atomic fine-structure spectroscopy. The importance of the spatial information on atomic and ionized carbon is discussed. The gas cooling process which allows clouds to collapse to form stars by means of the submillimeter line emission is discussed. Also covered are regions suffering shocks, photodissociation regions, and stellar outflow regions. Work on the submillimeter spectrum of nearby galaxies is briefly described.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/5.175248","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","startPage":"1662","endPage":"1678","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel1/5/4457/00175248.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/5.175248","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4457","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Submillimeter astronomy (heterodyne spectroscopy)","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Astronomy","Spectroscopy","Telescopes","Clouds","Astrochemistry","Optical receivers","NASA","Space technology","Carbon dioxide","Cooling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["astronomical spectra","interstellar molecular clouds","microwave spectroscopy","reviews","submillimetre astronomy"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["molecular clouds","EHF","THF","submillimeter-wave astronomy","heterodyne spectroscopy","dense interstellar medium","galaxies","line surveys","heavy molecule spectra","light molecule spectroscopy","atomic fine-structure spectroscopy","gas cooling process","submillimeter line emission","regions suffering shocks","photodissociation regions","stellar outflow regions"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov.  1992","displayDocTitle":"Submillimeter astronomy (heterodyne spectroscopy)","volume":"80","issue":"11","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4351754","publicationDate":"Nov. 1992","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  1992","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/175248/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Submillimeter astronomy (heterodyne spectroscopy)","sourcePdf":"00175248.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.071191S","chronDate":"Nov.  1992","isNumber":"4457","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"122","articleId":"175248","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-13"},{"_id":175249,"authors":[{"name":"J.W.

Bolometers for continuum observation, hot-electron mixer receivers for narrowband spectral line observation, and heterodyne receivers, both Schottky diode and superconducting tunnel junction, are presented. At the lower frequency end of the submillimeter band, standard waveguide techniques, scaled from millimeter wavelengths, prevail. At wavelengths shorter than about 0.5 mm, quasioptical designs are preferred. In the case of Schottky diode receivers, corner cube designs are used almost exclusively, whereas integrated mixer designs are the focal point of research for superconductor-insulator-superconductor (SIS) receivers at these wavelengths. Although such designs are extensively reviewed, it is nevertheless the Schottky diode mixer remains the element of choice at the shortest submillimeter wavelengths.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/5.175250","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","startPage":"1702","endPage":"1720","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel1/5/4457/00175250.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/5.175250","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4457","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Submillimeter receivers for radio astronomy","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Receivers","Radio astronomy","Schottky diodes","Superconducting devices","Submillimeter wave technology","Bolometers","Narrowband","Josephson junctions","Frequency","Millimeter wave technology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bolometers","electron device noise","mixers (circuits)","radio receivers","radiotelescopes","Schottky-barrier diodes","solid-state microwave devices","submillimetre astronomy","submillimetre wave devices","superconducting junction devices"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["submillimeter receivers","SIS receivers","radioastronomy","submm","THF","superconductor-insulator-superconductor receivers","continuum observation","hot-electron mixer receivers","narrowband spectral line observation","heterodyne receivers","standard waveguide techniques","Schottky diode receivers","corner cube designs","integrated mixer designs","Schottky diode mixer"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov.  1992","displayDocTitle":"Submillimeter receivers for radio astronomy","volume":"80","issue":"11","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4351756","publicationDate":"Nov. 1992","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  1992","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/175250/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Submillimeter receivers for radio astronomy","sourcePdf":"00175250.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.137485S","chronDate":"Nov.  1992","isNumber":"4457","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"97","articleId":"175250","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":175253,"authors":[{"name":"G.M.

A review of the efficiency definitions used with planar antennas is included.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/5.175253","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4457","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/5.175253","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel1/5/4457/00175253.pdf","startPage":"1748","endPage":"1770","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Millimeter-wave and terahertz integrated circuit antennas","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov.  1992","displayDocTitle":"Millimeter-wave and terahertz integrated circuit antennas","volume":"80","issue":"11","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  1992","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 1992","accessionNumber":"4351759","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/175253/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Millimeter-wave and terahertz integrated circuit antennas","sourcePdf":"00175253.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.118295S","chronDate":"Nov.  1992","isNumber":"4457","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"287","articleId":"175253","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":175254,"authors":[{"name":"L.P.B.

A list of possible noise sources is given. Through a series of experiments, all but one source is eliminated as being important, and the remaining source is shown to be dominant. The dominant noise source is the ovalizing deformation of the stator due to its radial magnetic attraction to the rotor. The emitted noise is particularly strong when the frequency of deformation coincides with that of a natural mechanical resonance of the stator. Several methods of reducing acoustic noise emission are studied. One successful method is the introduction of dither into the control of the motor in order to spread the spectrum of noise excitation and reduce its coupling to the mechanical resonance of the stator.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/28.175275","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4458","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/28.175275","endPage":"1255","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","pdfPath":"/iel1/28/4458/00175275.pdf","startPage":"1250","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The origin and reduction of acoustic noise in doubly salient variable-reluctance motors","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov/Dec 1992","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov/Dec 1992","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/175275/","displayDocTitle":"The origin and reduction of acoustic noise in doubly salient variable-reluctance motors","volume":"28","issue":"6","accessionNumber":"4338601","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Nov.-Dec. 1992","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The origin and reduction of acoustic noise in doubly salient variable-reluctance motors","sourcePdf":"00175275.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.032868S","chronDate":"Nov/Dec 1992","isNumber":"4458","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"28","citationCount":"318","articleId":"175275","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":175279,"authors":[{"name":"L.

Special emphasis is given to the generation of a DC component in the inverter output voltage in the case in which the output frequency is twice the input frequency.

Instead of current sensors, the drive uses power MOSFET transistors with integrated pilot devices for current sensing. To compensate for the loss of current feedback when the switches are 'off', a fixed off-time chopping strategy is used to control the phase currents. To eliminate the position sensor normally required for SR motor control, the controller estimates the rotor position using phase inductance measurements. The position estimation scheme is sufficiently precise to allow positioning of the phase firing pulses to within approximately two electrical degrees of the desired rotor angle, and full four-quadrant operation of the system is possible. A laboratory prototype system built and tested at speeds up to 3000 r/min shows good performance in all four operating quadrants, including at zero speed. The control is implemented in a single low-cost microprocessor.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","pdfPath":"/iel1/28/4458/00175286.pdf","startPage":"1339","endPage":"1344","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","doi":"10.1109/28.175286","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/28.175286","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4458","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=175286","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Application of sensor integration techniques to switched reluctance motor drives","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Reluctance motors","Phase estimation","Rotors","Reluctance machines","MOSFET circuits","Power MOSFET","Feedback","Switches","Strontium","Motor drives"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computerised control","electric drives","electric sensing devices","machine control","microcomputer applications","reluctance motors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["phase current control","rotor position estimation","microprocessor-based control","switched reluctance motor drives","power MOSFET transistors","fixed off-time chopping","phase inductance measurements","position estimation","phase firing pulses"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/175286/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov/Dec 1992","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov/Dec 1992","displayDocTitle":"Application of sensor integration techniques to switched reluctance motor drives","volume":"28","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Nov.-Dec. 1992","accessionNumber":"4338612","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Application of sensor integration techniques to switched reluctance motor drives","sourcePdf":"00175286.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.02297S","chronDate":"Nov/Dec 1992","isNumber":"4458","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"28","citationCount":"75","articleId":"175286","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":175287,"authors":[{"name":"R.B.

Only two of these showed signs of being usable. Both are based on the steady-state machine model and produce a fair slip accuracy for a machine running under perfect field alignment conditions. It was not determined whether the other four techniques were unsuccessful because they require a closed-loop speed controller, were presented incorrectly in the literature, or contain fundamental deficiencies. On the basis of these evaluations, a new technique was developed, and both measured and predicted results are presented to show that it works well. Moreover, this new technique has many features that make it theoretically and practically more attractive than most existing techniques.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/28.175290","startPage":"1367","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","pdfPath":"/iel1/28/4458/00175290.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/28.175290","endPage":"1375","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4458","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Evaluation of various slip estimation techniques for an induction machine operating under field-oriented control conditions","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/175290/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov/Dec 1992","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov/Dec 1992","displayDocTitle":"Evaluation of various slip estimation techniques for an induction machine operating under field-oriented control conditions","volume":"28","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4338616","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Nov.-Dec. 1992","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Evaluation of various slip estimation techniques for an induction machine operating under field-oriented control conditions","sourcePdf":"00175290.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.027163S","chronDate":"Nov/Dec 1992","isNumber":"4458","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"28","citationCount":"20","articleId":"175290","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":175291,"authors":[{"name":"T.S.

The simulation was used to optimize the water vapor channel selection and to test the accuracy of the remote sensing method. The channel selection minimizes the uncertainty in the derived water vapor due to variations in the spectral dependence of the surface reflectance. The selection also minimizes the sensitivity of the selected channels to possible drift in the channel position. The use of additional MODIS channels reduces the errors due to the effect of haze, subpixel clouds and uncertainties in the temperature profile. Remote sensing of the variation of water vapor from day to day will be more accurate, because the surface reflectances vary slowly with time.

Single-date images from seven areas were misregistered against themselves, and the statistical properties of the differences were analyzed. In the absence of any actual changes to the land surface, the consequences of misregistration were very marked even for subpixel misregistrations. Pairs of images from different time periods were then misregistered. For four densely covered areas, an error equivalent to greater than 50% of the actual differences in the NDVI, as measured by the semivariance, was induced by a misregistration of only one pixel. To achieve an error of only 10%, registration accuracies of 0.2 pixels or less are required. For three more sparsely vegetated areas with semiarid climates, a registration accuracy of between 0.5 and 1.0 pixel was sufficient to achieve an error of 10% or less.

A two-diode sampling bridge is integrated with the NLTL as the strobe pulse generator to achieve a sampling bandwidth of over 290 GHz. Also integrated are two samplers with a resistive directional bridge to form an S-parameter test-set on a chip. Greater than 10-dB directivity is demonstrated to 60 GHz. The speed of the sampler is evaluated by using the onboard NLTL test signal generator. With the test NLTL driven at 10 GHz+100 Hz and the strobe NLTL driven at 5 GHz, the sample output showed a 160- mu s 90% to 10% falltime which corresponds to 1.6 ps in real-time.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/175436/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-10 Oct. 1990","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"7-10 Oct. 1990","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1990","accessionNumber":"3999287","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Monolithic integrated circuits for mm-wave instrumentation","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Monolithic integrated circuits for mm-wave instrumentation","confLoc":"New Orleans, LA, USA","sourcePdf":"00175436.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.032031S","chronDate":"7-10 Oct. 1990","isNumber":"4463","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"155","citationCount":"19","articleId":"175436","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":175444,"authors":[{"name":"J.

The approach used to implement the concept is to place a variable-resistance element spanning a very short gap (compared to the width of the line) on a metal transmission line. Switching the gap material from the high resistance state to the low resistance state turns the line from an open circuit to the connected state. The topics discussed include the material system used, a specific demonstration of a microwave switch using this system, possible applications of the switch, and its present limitations and how they could be overcome.

Calculations, with both time-domain and harmonic-balance simulators, demonstrate agreement with measured performances: nominal output power levels between 500 mW and 1 W throughout the frequency range, associated gains to 9 dB for a single stage, and power added efficiencies of better than 10%.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/175465/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-10 Oct. 1990","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"7-10 Oct. 1990","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1990","accessionNumber":"3999309","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Advanced design for wideband MMIC power amplifiers","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Advanced design for wideband MMIC power amplifiers","confLoc":"New Orleans, LA, USA","sourcePdf":"00175465.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.034304S","chronDate":"7-10 Oct. 1990","isNumber":"4463","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"155","citationCount":"11","articleId":"175465","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":175471,"authors":[{"name":"D.E.

The purpose is to avoid the waveform degradation and further difficulties inherent in conventional ECL-interfacing when operating above 1 Gb/s. Characteristics of the proposed method include: (1) high and log I/O levels of typically 0.0 V and -0.9 V, respectively; (2) on-chip 59 ohm resistors as receiving-end terminators; and (3) signal distributor ICs for multi-fanout connections. The authors strongly believe that SCFL-interfacing is highly effective for ICs operating above 10 Gbit/s. However, as a first step, to insure compatibility with conventional ICs, they developed an 8 Gb/s GaAs standard logic IC family using a modified SCFL-interfacing in which both SCFL and ECL interfaces are available.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"12th Annual Symposium on Gallium Arsenide Integrated Circuit (GaAs IC)","pdfPath":"/iel2/155/4463/00175489.pdf","startPage":"211","endPage":"214","publicationTitle":"12th Annual Symposium on Gallium Arsenide Integrated Circuit (GaAs IC)","doi":"10.1109/GAAS.1990.175489","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GAAS.1990.175489","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4463","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=175489","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A new interfacing method 'SCFL-interfacing' is proposed for ultra-high-speed logic ICs","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Logic","Degradation","Resistors","Gallium arsenide","Assembly","Inverters","Large scale integration","Standards development","Integrated circuit packaging","Laboratories"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["gallium arsenide","III-V semiconductors","integrated logic circuits","monolithic integrated circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["interfacing method","ultra-high-speed logic ICs","I/O interfacing","waveform degradation","receiving-end terminators","signal distributor ICs","multi-fanout connections","SCFL-interfacing","standard logic IC family","8 Gbit/s","GaAs"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/175489/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-10 Oct. 1990","displayDocTitle":"A new interfacing method 'SCFL-interfacing' is proposed for ultra-high-speed logic ICs","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1990","accessionNumber":"4011187","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"7-10 Oct. 1990","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new interfacing method 'SCFL-interfacing' is proposed for ultra-high-speed logic ICs","confLoc":"New Orleans, LA, USA","sourcePdf":"00175489.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.02657S","chronDate":"7-10 Oct. 1990","isNumber":"4463","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"155","citationCount":"12","articleId":"175489","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":175528,"authors":[{"name":"R.

It is shown that, although the number of components and the sensitivity of the two configurations are the same, the dynamic range is noticeably different.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Bit rate","Gallium arsenide","MESFETs","Semiconductor optical amplifiers","Optical amplifiers","Stimulated emission","Optical sensors","Circuit analysis","Dynamic range","Optimization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["amplifiers","gallium arsenide","III-V semiconductors","optical communication equipment","preamplifiers","receivers","Schottky gate field effect transistors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["III-V semiconductors","MESFET amplifier","optical reception","performance optimization","transimpedance preamplifier","digital optical reception","bias resistor","high-frequency behavior","MESFET circuits","sensitivity","dynamic range","Y parameters","1.3 micron","GaAs"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ITS.1990.175647","publicationTitle":"SBT/IEEE International Symposium on Telecommunications","displayPublicationTitle":"SBT/IEEE International Symposium on Telecommunications","pdfPath":"/iel5/159/4464/00175647.pdf","startPage":"458","endPage":"462","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4464","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ITS.1990.175647","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimization of a high bit rate GaAs MESFET amplifier for optical reception","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=175647","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Optimization of a high bit rate GaAs MESFET amplifier for optical reception","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/175647/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1990","accessionNumber":"4132140","conferenceDate":"3-6 Sept. 1990","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-6 Sep 1990","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimization of a high bit rate GaAs MESFET amplifier for optical reception","confLoc":"Rio de Janeiro, Brazil","sourcePdf":"00175647.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.031757S","chronDate":"3-6 Sep 1990","isNumber":"4464","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"159","articleId":"175647","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":175735,"authors":[{"name":"J.

This formulation has an exact equivalence with the original LMS algorithm; hence it retains its convergence properties, while allowing a reduction in arithmetic complexity, even for very small block lengths. Working with small block lengths is interesting from an implementation point of view (large blocks result in large memory and large system delay) and allows a significant reduction in the number of operations. Tradeoffs between a number of operations and a convergence rate are obtainable by applying certain approximations to a matrix involved in the algorithm. Hence, the usual block LMS appears as a special case, which explains its convergence behavior according to the type of input signal (correlated or uncorrelated).<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/78.175735","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4466","startPage":"2904","endPage":"2920","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/78/4466/00175735.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A fast exact least mean square adaptive algorithm","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/175735/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1992","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1992","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"A fast exact least mean square adaptive algorithm","publicationDate":"Dec. 1992","accessionNumber":"4346406","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"40","issue":"12","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A fast exact least mean square adaptive algorithm","sourcePdf":"00175735.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.057952S","chronDate":"Dec 1992","isNumber":"4466","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"73","articleId":"175735","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":175736,"authors":[{"name":"J.

This approach leads to a complete identification of the sources.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/78.175753","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4466","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/78/4466/00175753.pdf","endPage":"3078","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Separation of independent sources from correlated inputs","doi":"10.1109/78.175753","startPage":"3074","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=175753","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1992","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1992","displayDocTitle":"Separation of independent sources from correlated inputs","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/175753/","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4346424","publicationDate":"Dec. 1992","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"40","issue":"12","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Separation of independent sources from correlated inputs","sourcePdf":"00175753.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.028648S","chronDate":"Dec 1992","isNumber":"4466","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"49","articleId":"175753","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":175754,"authors":[{"name":"J.

Applying these methods to finite-impulse-response (FIR) expressions, it is possible to reduce greatly the number of arithmetic operations needed.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.1991.176054","publicationTitle":"1991., IEEE International Sympoisum on Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"1991., IEEE International Sympoisum on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/555/4470/00176054.pdf","startPage":"1992","endPage":"1995 vol.4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.1991.176054","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4470","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimization of canonic signed digit multipliers for filter design","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Optimization of canonic signed digit multipliers for filter design","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4244425","publicationDate":"1991","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/176054/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 June 1991","conferenceDate":"11-14 June 1991","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimization of canonic signed digit multipliers for filter design","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"00176054.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.040551S","chronDate":"11-14 June 1991","isNumber":"4470","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"555","citationCount":"52","articleId":"176054","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":176055,"authors":[{"name":"Z.

To design a practical yield optimization system, two efforts must be made.

A convergence criterion based on sequential tests of a hypothesis is presented. This algorithm was implemented in a CADS (computer-aided design system). Applications of this algorithm show its high efficiency.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 June 1991","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/176055/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"4244426","publicationDate":"1991","conferenceDate":"11-14 June 1991","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A new yield optimization algorithm and its applications","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new yield optimization algorithm and its applications","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"00176055.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.033444S","chronDate":"11-14 June 1991","isNumber":"4470","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"555","citationCount":"2","articleId":"176055","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":176061,"authors":[{"name":"M.H.

The method is similar to that used in the OASYS program in that it uses no simulation. Like the OASYS method, the authors estimate the sizes and then calculate the parasitics. The parasitics calculated are then used to recalculate the sizes. This process continues until the parasitics change only little. Unlike OASYS, the authors separated the sizing method from the model of the transistor. This means one is able to use any transistor model to size the transistors, and, because the method does not use simulation and so makes less calls of the model equations, the model used can be more complicated than that used for simulation.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Operational amplifiers","Computational modeling","Circuit simulation","Semiconductor device modeling","Phase estimation","Voltage","Laboratories","CMOS process","Size control","Process control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["circuit layout CAD","CMOS integrated circuits","operational amplifiers","semiconductor device models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["transistor sizing method","layout CAD","iterative process","nonsimulation method","CMOS op-amps","parasitics","transistor model"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.1991.176061","publicationTitle":"1991., IEEE International Sympoisum on Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"1991., IEEE International Sympoisum on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/555/4470/00176061.pdf","startPage":"2016","endPage":"2019 vol.4","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4470","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.1991.176061","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A method for sizing transistors in CMOS op-amps","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=176061","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A method for sizing transistors in CMOS op-amps","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/176061/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1991","accessionNumber":"4244431","conferenceDate":"11-14 June 1991","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 June 1991","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A method for sizing transistors in CMOS op-amps","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"00176061.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.021965S","chronDate":"11-14 June 1991","isNumber":"4470","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"555","articleId":"176061","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":176076,"authors":[{"name":"C.P.

The filter is based on a minimal transistor-only all-MOS high-frequency generalized impedance converter (GIC) that simulates a passive RLC ladder. The filter poles are obtained using the internal lumped capacitances of the MOS transistor. Using this structure a very high frequency filter is obtained consuming a small chip area. The center frequency is controlled by an external bias current to the circuit. Using the GIC, a bandpass filter can be implemented in MOS technology with center frequencies in excess of 50 MHz. The filter is simulated for center frequencies of 47 MHz, 54 MHz and 63 MHz.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4470","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.1991.176249","publicationTitle":"1991 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems (ISCAS)","displayPublicationTitle":"1991 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems (ISCAS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/555/4470/00176249.pdf","startPage":"1761","endPage":"1764 vol.3","doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.1991.176249","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A high-speed continuous-time bandpass VHF filter in MOS technology","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 June 1991","displayDocTitle":"A high-speed continuous-time bandpass VHF filter in MOS technology","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"11-14 June 1991","publicationDate":"1991","accessionNumber":"4243803","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/176249/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A high-speed continuous-time bandpass VHF filter in MOS technology","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"00176249.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.032055S","chronDate":"11-14 June 1991","isNumber":"4470","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"555","citationCount":"41","articleId":"176249","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":176267,"authors":[{"name":"Wonyong Sung","affiliation":["ISRC and Department of Control and Instrumentation, Seoul National University, Seoul, South Korea"],"lastName":"Wonyong Sung","id":"37290807000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-0050-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"176267","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":7,"totalDownloads":71},"abstract":"The use of fixed-point digital signal processors required a scaling of data at each arithmetic step to prevent overflows while keeping the accuracy. A development method which can automate this process is proposed. The programming uses a model of a hypothetical floating-point digital signal processor and a floating-point format for data representation. However, the program and data are automatically translated to fixed-point counterparts in order not to sacrifice the execution speed. To derive this method, an internal data representation method which consists of the mantissa, the exponent, and the range is employed. A pre-scaling-type fixed-point ALU architecture is used for the development of the proposed method.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"1991., IEEE International Sympoisum on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/555/4470/00176267.pdf","startPage":"37","endPage":"40 vol.1","publicationTitle":"1991., IEEE International Sympoisum on Circuits and Systems","doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.1991.176267","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.1991.176267","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4470","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=176267","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An automatic scaling method for the programming of fixed-point digital signal processors","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Automatic programming","Digital signal processors","Hardware","Signal processing","Assembly","Floating-point arithmetic","Programming profession","Fixed-point arithmetic","Automatic control","Instruments"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["automatic programming","computerised signal processing","digital signal processing chips"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["automatic scaling method","programming","fixed-point digital signal processors","floating-point format","internal data representation method","fixed-point ALU architecture"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/176267/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 June 1991","displayDocTitle":"An automatic scaling method for the programming of fixed-point digital signal processors","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1991","accessionNumber":"4229716","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"11-14 June 1991","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An automatic scaling method for the programming of fixed-point digital signal processors","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"00176267.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.024237S","chronDate":"11-14 June 1991","isNumber":"4470","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"555","citationCount":"3","articleId":"176267","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":176276,"authors":[{"name":"S.K.

A number of VQ schemes such as single-stage and multistage VQ and classified VQ can be implemented using this approach.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.1991.176305","publicationTitle":"1991., IEEE International Sympoisum on Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"1991., IEEE International Sympoisum on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/555/4470/00176305.pdf","startPage":"188","endPage":"191 vol.1","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4470","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.1991.176305","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Modular VLSI architectures for real-time vector quantization","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/176305/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 June 1991","displayDocTitle":"Modular VLSI architectures for real-time vector quantization","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1991","accessionNumber":"4229754","conferenceDate":"11-14 June 1991","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modular VLSI architectures for real-time vector quantization","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"00176305.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.029149S","chronDate":"11-14 June 1991","isNumber":"4470","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"555","citationCount":"4","articleId":"176305","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":176307,"authors":[{"name":"F.

A long line of analog delay elements accumulates noise, offset, supply coupled noise, and clock feedthrough, and consumes large area and power. It can be replaced by a simple binary shift register if the analog input is first coded by a Sigma - Delta modulator into a binary string. Doing so saves area, reduces circuit complexity, and makes the signal immune to delay element imperfections. The high frequency quantization noise produced by the Sigma - Delta modulator is removed by the lowpass or bandpass FIR filter being implemented. The price paid for these advantages is that the clock rate in the proposed oversampled FIR structure is about a factor of four to five times higher than conventional SC circuits for similar signal bandwidths.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/176328/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 June 1991","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"11-14 June 1991","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1991","accessionNumber":"4229777","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Analog FIR filters using the Sigma - Delta oversampling technique","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analog FIR filters using the Sigma - Delta oversampling technique","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"00176328.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.028124S","chronDate":"11-14 June 1991","isNumber":"4470","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"555","citationCount":"3","articleId":"176328","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":176332,"authors":[{"name":"K.-K.

The authors introduce novel schemes for the interpolation of the missing samples, called the division method. From the nonuniform sampling theorem it is known that, as long as the sampling rate of a signal satisfies the Nyquist rate, the signal is uniquely determined by the set of the nonuniform samples. The authors consider the distorted signals as a set of nonuniform samples and derive the methods based on the theorem. A number of simulations have been performed for both distorted voice and image signals. The advantage of this method is that it is very simple to implement in real time.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/176389/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 June 1991","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"11-14 June 1991","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1991","accessionNumber":"4229815","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Voice and image recovery from lost samples","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Voice and image recovery from lost samples","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"00176389.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.193552S","chronDate":"11-14 June 1991","isNumber":"4470","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"555","articleId":"176389","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":176392,"authors":[{"name":"A.W.

The method is also extended to the IIR (infinite impulse response) case. Application to the PCG algorithm to very long filters is suggested to exploit the fact that the number of iterations of the PCG algorithm until convergence is independent of the filter order.

The design starts by sampling the desired frequency response in order to generate a complex matrix that represents both the amplitude and the phase responses. The SVD is then applied to this matrix to obtain an outer-product sum expression. It is shown that each vector in an outer-product term can be interpreted as the frequency response of a 1-D digital filter and therefore the design task can be completed if methods for the design of 1-D digital filters with arbitrary amplitude and phase responses are available. Two such methods for the design of 1-D FIR filters based on least-squares and least-pth optimization are presented. The proposed method is relatively simple to apply and leads to a parallel arrangement of pairs of cascaded 1-D filter sections. Structures of this type allow a large amount of concurrent processing and, further, they can be implemented in terms of systolic arrays. Therefore. they are amenable to VLSI implementation.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/176410/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 June 1991","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"11-14 June 1991","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1991","accessionNumber":"4233606","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Design of 2-D digital filters with arbitrary amplitude and phase responses by using the singular value decomposition","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design of 2-D digital filters with arbitrary amplitude and phase responses by using the singular value decomposition","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"00176410.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.030744S","chronDate":"11-14 June 1991","isNumber":"4470","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"555","citationCount":"7","articleId":"176410","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":176483,"authors":[{"name":"Z.M.

The authors introduce three measures of system structure called sparsity, connectivity, and clustering and develop a method that provides a basis for structural analysis, and arrangement of systems. Using those measures, the authors develop a technique of analyzing and (re-)arranging the structure of a given system. The key component of the technique is called the node reduction method. This method is applied to a graph that represents the structure of a system. It combines two nodes to construct a new supernode and updates the original graph. The authors implemented the node reduction method in FORTRAN on a personal computer. Based on experimental results, it is shown that the global structural analysis and arrangement of systems is very useful.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/176509/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 June 1991","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1991","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4233627","conferenceDate":"11-14 June 1991","displayDocTitle":"Structural analysis and arrangement of systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Structural analysis and arrangement of systems","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"00176509.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042972S","chronDate":"11-14 June 1991","isNumber":"4470","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"555","articleId":"176509","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-11"},{"_id":176547,"authors":[{"name":"F.

(2) The operating ranges of the input voltage and of the output current can be wider than the converter using a PWM controller. (3) The inrush current of the SC AC-DC converter can be easily limited to a desired value by the phase controller without producing any extra loss. (4) The operating frequency of the phase controller covers almost all commercial frequency ranges, from several tens of Hz to several hundred Hz, without any adjustment.

The equivalence relation has first been established between the problem of maximum likelihood decoding (MLD) of graph theoretic codes and that of minimizing an energy function of the Hopfield networks associated with those graphs (J. Bruck and M. Blaum 1989). This, is turn, allows construction of a Hopfield neural network which performs a MLD function in a natural way. However, the existence of the local minima problem, although considerably relaxed in these nets, prevents the completeness of the new decoding approach. Therefore, the authors modify the traditional Hopfield model by adding a detection mechanism to overcome the problem.

Analog ANNs should be faster and smaller than digital implementations; however, the problem of the smaller dynamic range of analog storage must be addressed. The main problems are the required level of connectivity and long-term storage. With regard to connectivity, analog ANNs may be restricted to applications where only local connectivity is required, or where the number of neurons is small enough that essentially full connectivity can be achieved with VLSI. The problems with long-term storage are the complexity required and the resolution required for the backward error propagation (BEP) learning algorithm. The prospects of several different techniques for implementing analog ANNs are presented along with a brief survey of recent research results.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.1991.176601","pdfPath":"/iel5/555/4470/00176601.pdf","startPage":"1271","endPage":"1274 vol.2","displayPublicationTitle":"1991., IEEE International Sympoisum on Circuits and Systems","publicationTitle":"1991., IEEE International Sympoisum on Circuits and Systems","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.1991.176601","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4470","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analog implementations of artificial neural networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/176601/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 June 1991","displayDocTitle":"Analog implementations of artificial neural networks","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4233670","publicationDate":"1991","conferenceDate":"11-14 June 1991","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analog implementations of artificial neural networks","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"00176601.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.040534S","chronDate":"11-14 June 1991","isNumber":"4470","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"555","citationCount":"5","articleId":"176601","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":176604,"authors":[{"name":"B.

The value of the learned weight is present at a capacitor for each synapse.

The low-frequency noise source is modeled by the square of the magnitude of a rational function. A lossy SCN containing finite ON-resistances associated with MOS switches exhibits a well-defined output noise even when a limit-value computation is used to force the resistances to zero. The limit-value computation technique to determine this remaining average power spectral density takes advantage of the complete-charge-transfer assumption fully, and thus leads to an efficient noise analysis. The technique avoids the computation of eigenvalues or matrix exponentials even though the ON-resistors must be formulated.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 June 1991","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/176681/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1991","accessionNumber":"4239149","conferenceDate":"11-14 June 1991","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","displayDocTitle":"Exact noise analysis of 'ideal' SC networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Exact noise analysis of 'ideal' SC networks","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"00176681.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047859S","chronDate":"11-14 June 1991","isNumber":"4470","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"555","citationCount":"11","articleId":"176681","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":176683,"authors":[{"name":"Pao-Hsu Shih","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Pao-Hsu Shih","id":"37087426807"},{"name":"Wu-Shung Feng","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Wu-Shung Feng","id":"37087426428"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-0050-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"176683","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":9},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=176683","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Routing","Neurons","Hopfield neural networks","NP-complete problem","Delay"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["circuit layout","combinatorial mathematics","neural nets","optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Hopfield network","neural network","channel routing","combinatorial optimization","lower bounds"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.1991.176683","pdfPath":"/iel5/555/4470/00176683.pdf","publicationTitle":"1991 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems (ISCAS)","displayPublicationTitle":"1991 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems (ISCAS)","startPage":"1593","endPage":"1596 vol.3","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4470","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.1991.176683","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A neural network approach to channel routing","abstract":"A neural network is proposed for the channel routing problem.

It is shown that this test provides an improved bound on the number of faults for detecting irreparability. The new tests presented are simpler than previous tests and they run in linear time. The authors also propose an algorithm that integrates these new tests for the fault covering problem. The integrated algorithm is very fast and very effective. Extensive testing using a large sample of problems with the generalized negative binomial fault distribution as well as problems with random fault distribution shows that the integrated algorithm is able to detect virtually all instances of reparability and irreparability.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/176711/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 June 1991","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"1991","accessionNumber":"4244464","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"11-14 June 1991","isConference":true,"displayDocTitle":"New results on fault covering in RRAMs","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"New results on fault covering in RRAMs","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"00176711.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053613S","chronDate":"11-14 June 1991","isNumber":"4470","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"555","citationCount":"2","articleId":"176711","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":176714,"authors":[{"name":"B.H.

The approach translates the harmonic distortion components of a non-ideal DAC (digital-to-analog converter) in the feedback loop of the Sigma - Delta A/D converter to high-frequency components, which can then be filtered out by the decimation filter. Extensive computer simulations have confirmed that a third-order Sigma - Delta A/D converter using a 3-bit quantizer and the new dynamic element matching internal DAC can achieve 104 dB (17+bit) dynamic range and a harmonic distortion below 100 dB with an oversampling ratio of only 64.

Those parameters which are under the designer's control are geometric in nature and are collectively represented by a point in geometric space (G-space) whose axes are typically device widths. The aim of the yield enhancement algorithm is to move the point in G-space representing the design to a new location with which is associated a maximum-and hopefully 100%-manufacturing yield. Parameter adjustments can be automated but demand efficient algorithms. Both algorithms are based on a proven statistical design centering technique for discrete component circuits, modified to account for the particular characteristics of IC design. Designed for use within an automated analog design environment, both algorithms are robust and feature cost-saving techniques. However, it appears that the relative efficiency of these algorithms is influenced by the size of the design problem.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/176800/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 June 1991","publicationDate":"1991","conferenceDate":"11-14 June 1991","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4244424","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Parametric yield enhancement of analogue integrated circuits: a new approach","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Parametric yield enhancement of analogue integrated circuits: a new approach","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"00176800.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.030744S","chronDate":"11-14 June 1991","isNumber":"4470","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"555","citationCount":"3","articleId":"176800","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":176812,"authors":[{"name":"M.

The faults under study consist of catastrophic faults and out-of-specification faults. Even if the faults are restricted to the passive components and MOS switches (i.e. the operational amplifiers are assumed fault-free), the effects of these faults are quite complex, especially the out-of-specification faults. For example, an incorrect value of the resistor R/sub on/ of an MOS switch and an incorrect value of the capacitor in some cases have the same faulty manifestations at the output, and may be thought of as equivalent faults. The concept of fault equivalence is validated for analog circuits. The results show that various types of faults are distinguishable, thus reducing the size of the analog fault dictionary used in further diagnosis.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4470","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.1991.176812","publicationTitle":"1991., IEEE International Sympoisum on Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"1991., IEEE International Sympoisum on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/555/4470/00176812.pdf","startPage":"2072","endPage":"2075 vol.4","doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.1991.176812","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fault modeling and testing generation for sample-and-hold circuits","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 June 1991","displayDocTitle":"Fault modeling and testing generation for sample-and-hold circuits","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"11-14 June 1991","publicationDate":"1991","accessionNumber":"4244445","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/176812/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fault modeling and testing generation for sample-and-hold circuits","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"00176812.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.023608S","chronDate":"11-14 June 1991","isNumber":"4470","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"555","citationCount":"16","articleId":"176812","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":176818,"authors":[{"name":"J.J.

The impact of scaling on the performance of the BiCMOS SRAM stems from the down-scaling of the integration size, which determines the parasitic capacitive load of the word lines and the bit lines. As a result, the access time of a scaled BiCMOS SRAM is determined mainly by the word-line and the bit-line delays. As for the ECL circuits, the scaled delay is mostly influenced by the reduction in the allocated power. According to the analysis, further integration of the BiCMOS SRAMs over 1 Mbits is limited by the evolution of the CMOS processing technology and the BiCMOS circuit design techniques, which can help resolve the access time disadvantage resulting from the increased size without a substantial power penalty.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.1991.176818","publicationTitle":"1991., IEEE International Sympoisum on Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"1991., IEEE International Sympoisum on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/555/4470/00176818.pdf","startPage":"2116","endPage":"2119 vol.4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.1991.176818","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4470","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=176818","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Scaling consideration of BiCMOS SRAMs","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 June 1991","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/176818/","displayDocTitle":"Scaling consideration of BiCMOS SRAMs","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1991","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"11-14 June 1991","accessionNumber":"4244456","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Scaling consideration of BiCMOS SRAMs","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"00176818.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060376S","chronDate":"11-14 June 1991","isNumber":"4470","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"555","articleId":"176818","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":176830,"authors":[{"name":"P.

The first scheme is modified quadrature amplitude modulation (MQAM), for which the orthogonality property of the in-phase and quadrature signals are preserved, although the signal constellation is no longer rectangular. The second scheme is triangular shaped signal set (TSSS), which is a member of the general class of amplitude phase shift keying systems. The main objective of employing either MQAM or TSSS is to achieve almost optimum performance or the optimum performance, respectively, under the peak signal power limitations. This, however, should be achieved without unduly increasing hardware complexity. The probabilities of the error performances for MQAM and TSSS are determined, and the the detection characteristics for the three types of modulation schemes are compared. TSSS shows the best performance over both QAM (quadrature amplitude modulation) and MQAM when the alphabet size is larger than 64.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"Fourth IEEE Region 10 International Conference TENCON","pdfPath":"/iel2/843/4471/00176918.pdf","startPage":"158","endPage":"161","publicationTitle":"Fourth IEEE Region 10 International Conference TENCON","doi":"10.1109/TENCON.1989.176918","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TENCON.1989.176918","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4471","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=176918","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance evaluation of modified QAM and triangular shaped signal set","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Quadrature amplitude modulation","Signal to noise ratio","Hardware","Degradation","Constellation diagram","Signal analysis","Performance analysis","Optimized production technology","Gaussian noise","Magnesium compounds"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["amplitude modulation","phase shift keying"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["modified QAM","signaling","large alphabet size","modified quadrature amplitude modulation","MQAM","orthogonality","quadrature signals","signal constellation","triangular shaped signal set","amplitude phase shift keying","peak signal power limitations","error performances","detection characteristics"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/176918/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 Nov 1989","displayDocTitle":"Performance evaluation of modified QAM and triangular shaped signal set","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1989","accessionNumber":"3999075","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"22-24 Nov. 1989","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance evaluation of modified QAM and triangular shaped signal set","confLoc":"Bombay, India","sourcePdf":"00176918.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.025054S","chronDate":"22-24 Nov 1989","isNumber":"4471","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"843","citationCount":"1","articleId":"176918","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":176927,"authors":[{"name":"S.

The HF radio link is modeled as having three different Rayleigh-fading paths (sky waves).

The Information Manager (IM) supports the pilot by intelligently presenting timely information in an easily interpreted form. The authors describe the requirements which a successful IM must fulfil. Among these are processing pilot display requests, reducing workload by configuring controls and displays automatically, alerting the pilot of pertinent events, and decluttering displays based on the pilot's current workload. In addition to these requirements, six constraints have been placed on the output of IM. IM's output must be timely and relevant, flexible and responsive, and predictable and intuitive. The constraints were addressed by the IM design. Search Technology's approach to providing information management in a real-time avionics environment is outlined. This approach has two main parts: the design and real-time considerations of the design.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4472","publicationTitle":"IEEE/AIAA 10th Digital Avionics Systems Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE/AIAA 10th Digital Avionics Systems Conference","pdfPath":"/iel2/885/4472/00177206.pdf","doi":"10.1109/DASC.1991.177206","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DASC.1991.177206","startPage":"440","endPage":"445","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A real-time approach to information management in a pilot's associate","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-17 Oct 1991","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/177206/","displayDocTitle":"A real-time approach to information management in a pilot's associate","conferenceDate":"14-17 Oct. 1991","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"4239527","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1991","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A real-time approach to information management in a pilot's associate","confLoc":"Los Angeles, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00177206.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.085874S","chronDate":"14-17 Oct 1991","isNumber":"4472","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"885","citationCount":"7","articleId":"177206","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":177308,"authors":[{"name":"E.

This is achieved by introducing delays or buffers on certain lines, so that the resulting graph is balanced, i.e., travel times along any two paths with common endpoints are the same. The buffer assignment problem is how to balance a rooted acyclic data flow graph with a minimum number of buffer units. Recently, an integer programming decomposition procedure was proposed for this problem. The decomposition was introduced in an attempt to circumvent the exponential blowup typical of integer programming algorithms. It is shown that the buffer assignment problem can in fact be solved to optimality in low-degree polynomial time. The result is obtained by a sequence of reformulations of the problem, leading to models to which simple and efficient network flow procedures can be successfully applied.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/12.177308","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel1/12/4475/00177308.pdf","startPage":"1380","endPage":"1385","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4475","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/12.177308","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1992","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1992","displayDocTitle":"A polynomial algorithm for balancing acyclic data flow graphs","volume":"41","issue":"11","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Nov. 1992","accessionNumber":"4344145","isJournal":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/177308/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A polynomial algorithm for balancing acyclic data flow graphs","sourcePdf":"00177308.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.041524S","chronDate":"Nov 1992","isNumber":"4475","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"8","articleId":"177308","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2022-01-14"},{"_id":177309,"authors":[{"name":"A.

The algorithm is based on a three-layer backpropagation artificial neural network; trained to differentiate between simulated normal and abnormal tissue and to classify three types of simulated abnormalities.

The capacitance between the blade tip and mounted capacitance electrode within a guard ring of a probe forms one of the feedback elements of an operational amplifier (op amp). The differential equation governing the circuit taking into consideration the nonideal features of the op amp was formulated and solved for two types of inputs (ramp and DC) that are of interest for the application. Under certain time-dependent constraints, it is shown that (1) with a ramp input the circuit has an output voltage proportional to the static tip clearance capacitance, and (2) with a DC input, the output is proportional to the derivative of the clearance capacitance. and subsequent integration recovers the dynamic capacitance. The technique accommodates long cable lengths and environmentally induced changes in cable and probe parameters. System implementation for both static and dynamic measurements having the same high sensitivity is also presented.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Capacitance measurement","Circuits","Operational amplifiers","Probes","Prototypes","Turbines","Engines","Blades","Electrodes","Feedback"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["aerospace engines","aerospace testing","capacitance measurement","distance measurement","electric sensing devices","gas turbines","operational amplifiers","signal processing equipment"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["static measurement","time domain measurement","successive approximation","blade-tip clearance measurement","dual amplifier","ramp/DC inputs","integration","turbine engines","capacitance electrode","guard ring","probe","operational amplifier","differential equation","static tip clearance capacitance","dynamic capacitance","dynamic measurements"]}],"doi":"10.1109/19.177341","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement","pdfPath":"/iel1/19/4476/00177341.pdf","startPage":"674","endPage":"678","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4476","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/19.177341","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Capacitance-type blade-tip clearance measurement system using a dual amplifier with ramp/DC inputs and integration","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=177341","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Capacitance-type blade-tip clearance measurement system using a dual amplifier with ramp/DC inputs and integration","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/177341/","volume":"41","issue":"5","publicationDate":"Oct. 1992","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4338379","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1992","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1992","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Capacitance-type blade-tip clearance measurement system using a dual amplifier with ramp/DC inputs and integration","sourcePdf":"00177341.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.029588S","chronDate":"Oct 1992","isNumber":"4476","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"19","citationCount":"14","articleId":"177341","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":177352,"authors":[{"name":"K.E.

The color of each row indicates a statistic of interest, e.g., red rows are those most recently changed, and blue are those least recently changed. Seesoft displays data derived from a variety of sources, such as version control systems that track the age, programmer, and purpose of the code (e.g., control ISDN lamps, fix bug in call forwarding); static analyses, (e.g., locations where functions are called); and dynamic analyses (e.g., profiling). By means of direct manipulation and high interaction graphics, the user can manipulate this reduced representation of the code in order to find interesting patterns. Further insight is obtained by using additional windows to display the actual code.

The models are acquired automatically and approximated by polygons with multiple line tolerances for robustness. Groups of consecutive segments (super segments) are then encoded and entered into a table. This provides the essential mechanism for indexing and fast retrieval. Once the database of all models is built, the recognition proceeds by segmenting the scene into a polygonal approximation; the code for each super segment retrieves model hypotheses from the table. Hypotheses are clustered if they are mutually consistent and represent the instance of a model. Finally, the estimate of the transformation is refined. This methodology makes it possible to recognize models despite noise, occlusion, scale rotation translation, and a restricted range of weak perspective. A complexity bound is obtained.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/34.177385","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel1/34/4478/00177385.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/34.177385","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4478","startPage":"1198","endPage":"1204","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Structural indexing: efficient 2D object recognition","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=177385","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Structural indexing: efficient 2D object recognition","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1992","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/177385/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1992","isJournal":true,"volume":"14","issue":"12","publicationDate":"Dec. 1992","accessionNumber":"4338695","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Structural indexing: efficient 2D object recognition","sourcePdf":"00177385.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.037863S","chronDate":"Dec 1992","isNumber":"4478","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"80","articleId":"177385","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":177403,"authors":[{"name":"J.P.

STAIC features an input modeling language for entering hierarchical circuit descriptions and a symbolic/numeric solve unit that dynamically integrates analytical model equations across hierarchical boundaries.

The output is thus tailored for optimization and other numerically intense design exploration procedures. All model descriptions include physical layout so that important net parasitics may be fully accounted for during design evaluation.

Because the turn-on losses can be almost completely avoided by phase-shift PWM (pulse-width modulation), emphasis is placed on the determination of the turn-off losses. The dependencies of the switching power losses per switching cycle on the load condition and on the junction temperature are investigated for the following cases: simple PWM (switching without snubber), switching with capacitive parallel branch (turn-off snubber network), and force commutation of the power electronic switches using a commutation circuit (zero-current switching). The results obtained indicate the possibility of rating the overall effort linked to a given operating mode of the power electronic devices. The limits of the operating region of the converter system can also be determined.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4487","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IAS.1991.178060","publicationTitle":"Conference Record of the 1991 IEEE Industry Applications Society Annual Meeting","displayPublicationTitle":"Conference Record of the 1991 IEEE Industry Applications Society Annual Meeting","pdfPath":"/iel2/608/4487/00178060.pdf","startPage":"1508","endPage":"1514 vol.2","doi":"10.1109/IAS.1991.178060","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis of turn-off behavior and switching losses of a 1200 V/50 A zero-voltage or zero-current switched IGBT","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 28 1991-Oct. 4 1991","displayDocTitle":"Analysis of turn-off behavior and switching losses of a 1200 V/50 A zero-voltage or zero-current switched IGBT","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"28 Sept.-4 Oct. 1991","publicationDate":"1991","accessionNumber":"4248655","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/178060/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis of turn-off behavior and switching losses of a 1200 V/50 A zero-voltage or zero-current switched IGBT","confLoc":"Dearborn, MI, USA","sourcePdf":"00178060.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.031808S","chronDate":"Sept. 28 1991-Oct. 4 1991","isNumber":"4487","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"608","citationCount":"12","articleId":"178060","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":178071,"authors":[{"name":"Y.H.

As a result, it is verified that magnet skewing has the same effects on cogging torque and BEMF as slot skewing and that the cogging torque and the ripple of BEMF are reduced to zero with skewing magnets or slots by one slot pitch.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/IAS.1991.178154","displayPublicationTitle":"Conference Record of the 1991 IEEE Industry Applications Society Annual Meeting","pdfPath":"/iel2/608/4487/00178154.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4487","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IAS.1991.178154","publicationTitle":"Conference Record of the 1991 IEEE Industry Applications Society Annual Meeting","startPage":"191","endPage":"197 vol.1","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis of skew effects on cogging torque and BEMF for BLDCM","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=178154","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 28 1991-Oct. 4 1991","displayDocTitle":"Analysis of skew effects on cogging torque and BEMF for BLDCM","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/178154/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1991","accessionNumber":"4239276","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"28 Sept.-4 Oct. 1991","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis of skew effects on cogging torque and BEMF for BLDCM","confLoc":"Dearborn, MI","sourcePdf":"00178154.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061645S","chronDate":"Sept. 28 1991-Oct. 4 1991","isNumber":"4487","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"608","citationCount":"19","articleId":"178154","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-11"},{"_id":178171,"authors":[{"name":"N.

Several types of shunt harmonic filters are presented. The analysis includes the basic principles, the application of the Z-bus method, and the economic aspects for harmonic filter design. Offline steady-state simulation programs were used to model loads, to study variation of the harmonics, and to evaluate the effect of harmonic filters at various buses in the system. The performance of each filter design was tested using data recorded in local utility systems. A method of reducing resonance that may occur due to the presence of the filter is also suggested. The transient analysis of harmonic filters using the electromagnetic transients program (EMTP) is reported.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Harmonic filters","Power harmonic filters","EMTP","Harmonic distortion","Drives","Harmonic analysis","Steady-state","Load modeling","System testing","Resonance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["digital simulation","electric distortion","electronic engineering computing","harmonics","high-pass filters","passive filters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["economics","offline steady-state simulation programs","harmonic filter design","harmonic distortion","shunt harmonic filters","Z-bus method","electromagnetic transients program","EMTP"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4489","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/REPCON.1992.178940","startPage":"B2/1","endPage":"B2/7","publicationTitle":"[Proceedings] 1992 Rural Electric Power Conference.

Results show, for example, that power reductions of about 40 times can be obtained without speed loss by using supply voltages down to about 0.48 V.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/4.179198","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel5/4/4494/00179198.pdf","startPage":"10","endPage":"17","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/4.179198","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4494","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Trading speed for low power by choice of supply and threshold voltages","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1993","displayDocTitle":"Trading speed for low power by choice of supply and threshold voltages","volume":"28","issue":"1","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4360375","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 1993","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/179198/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1993","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Trading speed for low power by choice of supply and threshold voltages","sourcePdf":"00179198.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.037781S","chronDate":"Jan 1993","isNumber":"4494","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"181","articleId":"179198","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":179201,"authors":[{"name":"J.S.

A detailed analysis of the classifier configuration is presented; design issues are addressed, and limitations are identified. It is shown that the ratio of the maximum Hamming weight to the minimum Hamming distance that can be handled by the classifier has an upper bound. As long as the exemplars comply with this upper bound, the network does not impose any limitation on the word length. A very large exemplar count, on the other hand, can impair connection density, but this problem can be averted by using multiple discriminators.

The bound is shown to be asymptotically tight with the relaxation of the spectral constraints. Its maximization over a given set of admissible spectra is closely related to an analogous problem in the AWGN regime. The results are used for bounding the capacity of a Poisson channel under a second-moment-bandwidth constraint, as well as the capacity under a strict bandwidth constraint. Asymptotically tight lower bounds on the channel capacity for the above two cases are also presented. The approach for lower bounding the capacity for the latter case yields, as a by-product, improved bounds on the bit-error probability in uncoded amplitude shift keying (and on-off modulation as a special case) operating over a Poisson channel impaired by intersymbol interference.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/179338/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1993","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1993","publicationDate":"Jan. 1993","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4389164","volume":"39","issue":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Bounds on the capacity of a spectrally constrained Poisson channel","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Bounds on the capacity of a spectrally constrained Poisson channel","sourcePdf":"00179338.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.070072S","chronDate":"Jan 1993","isNumber":"4498","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"39","articleId":"179338","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":179339,"authors":[{"name":"S.

The performance of these quantizers is determined by two separable quantities, the granular gain and the boundary gain, which are determined by the shapes of the granular cells and of the support region, respectively. The granular gain and boundary gain are the duals of shaping and coding gain in data transmission applications. Using this duality, it is shown for Gaussian sources that the ultimate achievable boundary gain with high-rate lattice-bounded lattice codebooks is the same as the ultimate gain that can be obtained from variable-rate entropy coding. It is observed that if lattice codebooks can achieve the ultimate granular gain of 0.255 b per dimension, then lattice-bounded lattice codebooks can approach the rate-distortion limit.

As for erasures, these array codes have an efficient decoding algorithm which avoids multiplications (or divisions) over extension fields, replacing these operations with cyclic shifts of vectors over GF(q). The erasure decoding algorithm can be adapted easily to handle single column errors as well. The codes are characterized geometrically by means of parity constraints along certain diagonal lines in each code array, thus generalizing a previously known construction for the special case of two erasures. Algebraically, they can be interpreted as Reed-Solomon codes. When q is primitive in GF(q), the resulting codes become (conventional) Reed-Solomon codes of length P over GF(q/sup p-1/), in which case the new erasure decoding technique can be incorporated into the Berlekamp-Massey algorithm, yielding a faster way to compute the values of any prescribed number of errors.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/18.179343","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/18.179343","startPage":"66","endPage":"77","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/4498/00179343.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4498","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"New array codes for multiple phased burst correction","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/179343/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1993","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1993","displayDocTitle":"New array codes for multiple phased burst correction","volume":"39","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4389169","publicationDate":"Jan. 1993","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"New array codes for multiple phased burst correction","sourcePdf":"00179343.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.079356S","chronDate":"Jan 1993","isNumber":"4498","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"105","articleId":"179343","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":179344,"authors":[{"name":"D.S.

It has been previously shown that within the nonparametric candidate family of all i.i.d. (or, more generally, Markov) distributions, the optimized exponentially twisted distribution is the unique asymptotically optimal sampling distribution. As n to infinity , the sampling cost required to stabilize the normalized variance grows with strictly positive exponential rate for any suboptimal sampling distribution, while this sampling cost for the optimal exponentially twisted distribution is only O(n/sup 1/2/). Here, it is established that the optimality is actually much stronger.

In addition, it is shown that the embedded parametric family of exponentially twisted distributions has a certain uniform asymptotic stability property.

Sato (1975). An important generalization of the Sato algorithm with extensive analysis appears in the work of A. Benveniste et al. (1980). These generalized algorithms have been shown to possess a desirable global convergence property under two idealized conditions. The convergence properties of this class of blind algorithms under practical constraints common to a variety of channel equalization applications that violate these idealized conditions are studied. Results show that, in practice, when the equalizer is finite-dimensional and/or the input is discrete (as in digital communications) the equalizer parameters may converge to parameter settings that fail to achieve the objective of approximating the channel inverse. It is also shown that a center spike initialization is insufficient to guarantee avoiding such ill-convergence.

A class of bilinear detectors is defined with the objective of obtaining the optimal bilinear detector. The optimality criterion considered is near-far resistance that denotes worst-case asymptotic efficiency over the signal energies and phases which are unknown at the receiver. The optimal bilinear detector is therefore obtained by solving a minimax optimization problem. In the finite packet length case, this detector is shown to be a time-varying multiinput multioutput linear decorrelating filter followed by differential decision logic. In the limit as packet lengths go to infinity, the time-varying decorrelating detector is replaced by a time-invariant multiinput multioutput decorrelating filter. Several properties of the optimally near-far resistant detector are established.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/179352/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1993","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1993","volume":"39","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 1993","accessionNumber":"4389178","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","displayDocTitle":"Noncoherent detection in asynchronous multiuser channels","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Noncoherent detection in asynchronous multiuser channels","sourcePdf":"00179352.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.031144S","chronDate":"Jan 1993","isNumber":"4498","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"65","articleId":"179352","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":179357,"authors":[{"name":"E.

The problem of finding a permutation of the bit positions for a given code that minimizes the state complexity of its minimal trellis diagram is related to the generalized Hamming weight hierarchy of a code, and it is shown that, for RM codes, the standard binary order of bit positions is optimum at every bit position with respect to the state complexity of a minimal trellis diagram by using a theorem due to V.K.

Dropping the requirement of gain identification allows equalizer anchoring. This results in the elimination of a degree of freedom that causes ill-convergence of conventional blind equalizers, and affords the possibility of using simple update rules based on the stochastic approximation of output energy. Unlike conventional blind equalizers, truncations of the nonrecursive infinite-dimensional realizations of those equalizers inherit the convergence properties of their infinitely parametrized counterparts. A globally convergent blind recursive equalizer for channels without all-pass sections is obtained based on the exact equalization of the minimum-phase part of the channel and the identification of its nonminimum-phase zeros.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/18.179377","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/4498/00179377.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/18.179377","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4498","startPage":"292","endPage":"297","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Blind equalization without gain identification","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=179377","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Blind equalization without gain identification","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1993","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/179377/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1993","isJournal":true,"volume":"39","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 1993","accessionNumber":"4384061","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Blind equalization without gain identification","sourcePdf":"00179377.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.058166S","chronDate":"Jan 1993","isNumber":"4498","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"27","articleId":"179377","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":179379,"authors":[{"name":"V.

The bit allocation problem in the transform domain is considered for a memoryless stationary vector source encoded by a VTQ system. It is assumed that the vector quantizer parameters (dimension, codebook size) are subject to a complexity constraint. The vector quantization lower bound on the attainable distortion at a given (high) rate is used for deriving the bit allocation algorithm for given vector dimensions. Then, the joint optimization of vector dimensions and bit allocations is considered. Given a complexity constraint, the optimal dimensions depend on the bit allocation, which, in turn, depends on the dimensions. An iterative algorithm is proposed for solving this problem.<<ETX>>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Bit rate","Vector quantization","Iterative algorithms","Transform coding","Councils","Source coding","Design optimization","Information theory","Cities and towns","Information processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["encoding","iterative methods","optimisation","transforms","vector quantisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["coding theory","vector transform quantization","bit allocation problem","transform domain","memoryless stationary vector source","VTQ","complexity constraint","lower bound","attainable distortion","joint optimization","vector dimensions","iterative algorithm"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=179379","doi":"10.1109/18.179379","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/4498/00179379.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/18.179379","startPage":"302","endPage":"305","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4498","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint bit allocation and dimensions optimization for vector transform quantization","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Joint bit allocation and dimensions optimization for vector transform quantization","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/179379/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1993","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1993","volume":"39","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Jan. 1993","accessionNumber":"4384063","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint bit allocation and dimensions optimization for vector transform quantization","sourcePdf":"00179379.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.020046S","chronDate":"Jan 1993","isNumber":"4498","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"11","articleId":"179379","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":179401,"authors":[{"name":"M.

Matched spectral null codes are shown to offer significant coding gains on magnetic channels over baseline PRML (class-4 partial response maximum likelihood sequence estimation). In magnetic storage products, requirements of minimum detection latency and guaranteed worst-case performance dictate the use of non-quasi-catastrophic codes. Degradation in simulated error rate performance due to quantization effects prior to Viterbi detection is characterized. Detector performance in the presence of colored noise, introduced in equalization of a Lorentzian channel to class-IV response via a zero-forcing or least-mean-square equalizer, is shown. The results shown are consistent with an asymptotic coding gain on the order of 3 dB over baseline PRML, despite the presence of colored noise.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/179662/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  1992","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  1992","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Sept. 1992","accessionNumber":"4338538","volume":"28","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Viterbi detection of matched spectral null codes for PR4 systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Viterbi detection of matched spectral null codes for PR4 systems","sourcePdf":"00179662.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.028674S","chronDate":"Sept.  1992","isNumber":"4499","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"20","articleId":"179662","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":179663,"authors":[{"name":"H.

The design methodology has been applied to an air-cored fixture for the post-assembly magnetization of a four-pole external rotor brushless DC motor. Its rotor is constructed from a stack of sintered radially anisotropic NdFeB ring magnets/ss and a solid mild steel core which will tend to act as a short-circuit to the applied magnetizing field and have induced eddy currents which inhibit the penetration of the magnetizing field into the magnet. The post-assembly magnetization of a three-phase brushless DC motor with an exterior rotor equipped with sintered NdFeB magnets has been shown to be feasible, albeit resulting in a slight decrease in performance compared to a motor constructed from premagnetized magnets. However, the post-assembly magnetization of interior rotor topologies is considerably more demanding. Nevertheless, the CAD facility for the design of post-assembly magnetization fixtures has been shown to agree well with results from the practical fixture considered.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/20.179709","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","startPage":"3036","endPage":"3038","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","pdfPath":"/iel1/20/4499/00179709.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/20.179709","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4499","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Computer-aided design of magnetizing fixtures for the post-assembly magnetization of rare-earth permanent magnet brushless DC motors","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Design automation","Fixtures","Magnetic anisotropy","Perpendicular magnetic anisotropy","Brushless DC motors","Magnetization","Rotors","Magnets","Design methodology","Anisotropic magnetoresistance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["DC motors","eddy currents","electric machine CAD","permanent magnet motors","rotors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["post-assembly magnetization","rare-earth permanent magnet brushless DC motors","computer-aided design","impulse magnetizing fixtures","air-cored fixture","four-pole external rotor brushless DC motor","sintered radially anisotropic","NdFeB ring magnets/ss","solid mild steel core","induced eddy currents"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  1992","displayDocTitle":"Computer-aided design of magnetizing fixtures for the post-assembly magnetization of rare-earth permanent magnet brushless DC motors","volume":"28","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4344217","publicationDate":"Sept. 1992","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  1992","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/179709/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Computer-aided design of magnetizing fixtures for the post-assembly magnetization of rare-earth permanent magnet brushless DC motors","sourcePdf":"00179709.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.045475S","chronDate":"Sept.  1992","isNumber":"4499","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"20","citationCount":"29","articleId":"179709","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":179719,"authors":[{"name":"E.S.

The erased states after AC and DC processes for very small field increments were found to be macroscopically similar, indicating that the state produced is likely to correspond to the magnetic ground state of the system. The difference between the AC and DCE techniques is that for the AC case at each step of field reduction the sample is cycled through a minor loop at 50 Hz where in the DCE case only one cycle is applied. The effect of rapid demagnetization was found to result in nonequilibrium magnetic configurations. The erased state in these films was found to be anisotropic, thus measurements should be made in the same direction as erasure in order to obtain the true interaction behavior. It is concluded that, when interaction effects are examined via the delta I technique, demagnetization processes which produce the lower energy magnetic configurations must be used.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/20.179784","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","startPage":"3282","endPage":"3284","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","pdfPath":"/iel1/20/4499/00179784.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/20.179784","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4499","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The effects of different demagnetisation processes on interaction effects in thin film media","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Demagnetization","Transistors","Chromium","Remanence","Magnetic films","Saturation magnetization","Material storage","Sputtering","Isothermal processes","Predictive models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["chromium","chromium alloys","cobalt alloys","demagnetisation","ferromagnetic properties of substances","magnetic recording","magnetic thin films","metallic thin films","nickel alloys"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["DC erasure","AC erasure","demagnetisation processes","interaction effects","thin film media","erasure processes","DC cyclic erasure","erased states","rapid demagnetization","nonequilibrium magnetic configurations","demagnetization processes","Cr underlayer","CoNiCr alloy","CoNiCr-Cr"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  1992","displayDocTitle":"The effects of different demagnetisation processes on interaction effects in thin film media","volume":"28","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4355406","publicationDate":"Sept. 1992","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  1992","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/179784/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The effects of different demagnetisation processes on interaction effects in thin film media","sourcePdf":"00179784.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.04301S","chronDate":"Sept.  1992","isNumber":"4499","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"20","citationCount":"33","articleId":"179784","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":179818,"authors":[{"name":"R.E.

Recent work has described a class of d/sub x/, k/sub y/ codes in two dimensions which satisfy the d/sub x/ constraint in one dimension and the k/sub y/ constraint in the other. In tape systems this method is extremely vulnerable to dropouts. A new class of two-dimensional run-length codes that operate using the usual d/sub x/, k/sub y/ constraint along the track is proposed, with an additional k/sub y/ constraint across the tracks. In this approach the horizontal d/sub x/, k/sub x/ code is allowed a much larger k/sub x/ constraint since it is no longer the sole carrier of clocking information. Capacities are calculated for a range of codes and number of channels, and an example of the construction of one such code is given. An extension of the codes that preserves clocking during channel loss is described.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/20.179818","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/20.179818","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","pdfPath":"/iel1/20/4500/00179818.pdf","startPage":"3407","endPage":"3416","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4500","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/179818/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov.  1992","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  1992","displayDocTitle":"A new class of two-dimensional RLL recording codes","volume":"28","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4355417","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Nov. 1992","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new class of two-dimensional RLL recording codes","sourcePdf":"00179818.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.026142S","chronDate":"Nov.  1992","isNumber":"4500","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"20","citationCount":"30","articleId":"179818","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":179829,"authors":[{"name":"E.

Two groups of students, subject-area experts and novices, were studied while browsing a Macintosh HyperCard application. Three browsing strategies were identified: (1) search-oriented browse: scanning and reviewing information relevant to a fixed task; (2) review-browse: scanning and reviewing interesting information in the presence of transient browse goals that represent changing tasks; and (3) scan-browse: scanning for interesting information without review. Most subjects used review-browse interspersed with search-oriented browse. Within this strategy, comparisons showed that experts browsed in more depth, and viewed information differently than did novices.

The method is proven to be effective by successfully solving the swinging control problem for a pendulum carried by a motor-driven cart.

To apply the proposed tree search procedure to the nonlinear control problem, some numerical calculations are performed.

It provides S-parameter measurement with broadband, high sensitivity, and accurate calibration. In addition, due to its inherent broadband signal generation on the wafer, high-frequency information of the circuits can be extracted merely by using DC probes. Starting from a hybrid testing configuration, the compatibility of PC switch fabrication with the MMIC production process is demonstrated. In this phase, 40-dB dynamic range in the S-parameter measurement was achieved. The success motivated the monolithic integration of the PC switches onto the MMIC. Efforts were made to reduce the size of the optical test structure. Good agreement between a conventional network analyzer measurement and two optical testing results has been achieved, showing that built-in optical test structures can be designed to have comparable overall size with existing CPW test structures. The S-parameter characterization of a nonlinear transmission line is demonstrated.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Photoconductivity","Sampling methods","MMICs","Testing","Nonlinear optics","Optical sensors","Optical switches","Optical fiber networks","Calibration","DC generators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["built-in self test","frequency response","integrated circuit testing","microwave measurement","MMIC","photoconducting devices","S-parameters","semiconductor switches"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["on wafer characterisation","photoconductive sampling","high-frequency response","MMIC","S-parameter measurement","calibration","broadband signal generation","DC probes","monolithic integration","switches","built-in optical test structures","nonlinear transmission line"]}],"doi":"10.1109/22.179895","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel1/22/4502/00179895.pdf","startPage":"2312","endPage":"2320","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4502","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/22.179895","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On-wafer photoconductive sampling of MMICs","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=179895","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"On-wafer photoconductive sampling of MMICs","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/179895/","volume":"40","issue":"12","publicationDate":"Dec. 1992","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4355298","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1992","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1992","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On-wafer photoconductive sampling of MMICs","sourcePdf":"00179895.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.042535S","chronDate":"Dec 1992","isNumber":"4502","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"14","articleId":"179895","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":179902,"authors":[{"name":"J.O.

The nonlinear equivalent circuit parameters of the diode are determined by a small-signal test method. A large-signal measurement using the same test mount has also been configured to determine the power conversion efficiency from microwave to DC as well as determining the de-embedded network impedance of the diode. A nonlinear circuit simulation program using a multireflection algorithm is used to verify the experimental results for the 2.45-GHz diode. A Ka-band mixer diode is simulated for a 35-GHz rectenna. Based on the simulation results, a patch-type 35-GHz rectenna is designed and tested in a waveguide simulator. The efficiency is 29% with 120-mW input power. Because the diode could generate undesirable harmonic radiation, a frequency-selective surface is designed to reduce the second harmonic radiation for a 2.45-GHz rectenna.

A T-equivalent circuit is used for the large-signal model of the HBT. The third-order nonlinear currents generated by the device nonlinearities are evaluated for this purpose and current cancellation is discussed. It is found that, even though the C/sub je/ and g/sub je/ related currents do not show pronounced cancellation, the total base-emitter current and the total base-collector current cancel partially. Second harmonic loading is addressed in view of IMD3 optimization while at the same time maintaining high gain through conjugate matching at the fundamental frequency. IMD3 is very sensitive to the nonlinear currents generated by g/sub je/ and alpha . Optimum IMD3 occurs at high second-harmonic reflection coefficients corresponding to open load conditions. Minimum and maximum IMD3 occurs for second-harmonic load reflection coefficient phases close to analogous extremes of the dominant nonlinear current of the device.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/179904/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1992","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1992","volume":"40","issue":"12","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4360392","publicationDate":"Dec. 1992","displayDocTitle":"Mechanisms determining third order intermodulation distortion in AlGaAs/GaAs heterojunction bipolar transistors","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Mechanisms determining third order intermodulation distortion in AlGaAs/GaAs heterojunction bipolar transistors","sourcePdf":"00179904.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.022198S","chronDate":"Dec 1992","isNumber":"4502","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"47","articleId":"179904","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2022-01-15"},{"_id":179914,"authors":[{"name":"M.

An important feature is that its performance is largely insensitive to errors in modeling the input PDF. The method involves changing the amplitude distribution of the source to be approximately Gaussian by all-pass filtering, then applying a Lloyd-Max quantizer designed for a Gaussian source. After quantization, the samples are passed through another all-pass filter, which is an approximate inverse of the first filter. The mean-square error (MSE) for the overall process is roughly equal to the quantization MSE for the intermediate Gaussian signal, independent of the source statistics. For some sources, this is actually an improvement over direct, correct-model Lloyd-Max quantization. The cost of this technique is some delay due to filtering.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/26.179928","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel1/26/4503/00179928.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4503","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/26.179928","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","startPage":"1670","endPage":"1674","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robust quantization of memoryless sources using dispersive FIR filters","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=179928","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1992","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1992","displayDocTitle":"Robust quantization of memoryless sources using dispersive FIR filters","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/179928/","volume":"40","issue":"11","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 1992","accessionNumber":"4370079","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust quantization of memoryless sources using dispersive FIR filters","sourcePdf":"00179928.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.039722S","chronDate":"Nov 1992","isNumber":"4503","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"35","articleId":"179928","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-28"},{"_id":179930,"authors":[{"name":"S.R.

Algorithms for assigning tones and for determining the orientation and broadcasting angles of the directional antennas are designed. Design examples are given.

An analytical expression is obtained of the probability that BER may exceed a fixed value in the presence of a simplified channel model. A suitable upper bound formulation is given to express the same probability in the presence of coding and diversity techniques. Finally, some application examples are proposed both with reference to slow frequency hopping and space diversity systems.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel1/26/4503/00179936.pdf","startPage":"1725","endPage":"1736","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","doi":"10.1109/26.179936","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/26.179936","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4503","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=179936","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analytical outage evaluation of TDMA local radio systems with coding and diversity","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Time division multiple access","Frequency diversity","Fading","System performance","Radio communication","Road vehicles","Analytical models","Testing","Bit error rate","Upper bound"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["diversity reception","encoding","fading","radio networks","time division multiple access"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["TDMA","analytical approach","outage probability","time-division multiple access","local radio systems","frequency selective fading","multiray model","multipath propagation","performance sensitivity","BER","channel model","coding","slow frequency hopping","space diversity"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/179936/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1992","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1992","displayDocTitle":"Analytical outage evaluation of TDMA local radio systems with coding and diversity","volume":"40","issue":"11","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 1992","accessionNumber":"4370087","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analytical outage evaluation of TDMA local radio systems with coding and diversity","sourcePdf":"00179936.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.027314S","chronDate":"Nov 1992","isNumber":"4503","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"8","articleId":"179936","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":179974,"authors":[{"name":"S.

Design aspects of mobile data radios are discussed to point out the hardware limitations due to regulations and technologies. The propagation characterization of the channel is investigated. (1) The RF field strength coverage of a base station predicted for urban, suburban, quasi-open, and open environments, is given. (2) Multipath fading models are given. The probabilities of success for a single try as a function of received signal levels are presented for different train speeds. (3) System bit error rates (BERs) for different cases are shown. The use of Reed-Solomon codes for forward error correction is also included to show the improvement of the system performance.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/30.179974","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel1/30/4504/00179974.pdf","startPage":"842","endPage":"849","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/30.179974","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4504","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design aspects and performance evaluation of ATCS mobile data link","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/179974/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1992","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1992","displayDocTitle":"Design aspects and performance evaluation of ATCS mobile data link","volume":"38","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 1992","accessionNumber":"4355570","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design aspects and performance evaluation of ATCS mobile data link","sourcePdf":"00179974.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.036429S","chronDate":"Nov 1992","isNumber":"4504","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"30","citationCount":"1","articleId":"179974","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"}]
