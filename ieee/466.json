Since network coded information can only be recovered after delivering a sufficient number of coded packets, the resulting decoding delay can become problematic for delay-sensitive applications such as real-time media streaming. Motivated by this observation, we consider several algorithms that minimize the decoding delay and analyze their performance by means of simulation. The algorithms differ both in the required information about the state of the neighborspsila buffers and in the way this knowledge is used to decide which packets to combine through coding operations. Our results show that a greedy algorithm, whose encodings maximize the number of nodes at which a coded packet is immediately decodable significantly outperforms existing network coding protocols.","doi":"10.1109/MAHSS.2008.4660042","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4660007","startPage":"80","endPage":"91","pdfPath":"/iel5/4653771/4660007/04660042.pdf","publicationTitle":"2008 5th IEEE International Conference on Mobile Ad Hoc and Sensor Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 5th IEEE International Conference on Mobile Ad Hoc and Sensor Systems","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MAHSS.2008.4660042","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Informed network coding for minimum decoding delay","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Encoding","Algorithm design and analysis","Decoding","Heuristic algorithms","Protocols","Delay","Buffer storage"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["delays","encoding","greedy algorithms","protocols","radio networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["informed network coding","minimum decoding delay","data dissemination","wireless network","coded packet","greedy algorithm","network coding protocol"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 29 2008-Oct. 2 2008","displayDocTitle":"Informed network coding for minimum decoding delay","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4660042/","dateOfInsertion":"28 October 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4660042/","accessionNumber":"10385330","publicationDate":"Sept. 2008","conferenceDate":"29 Sept.-2 Oct. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Informed network coding for minimum decoding delay","confLoc":"Atlanta, GA, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-10242008-00035.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062655S","chronDate":"Sept. 29 2008-Oct. 2 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4653771","isNumber":"4660007","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4653771","citationCount":"34","xplore-issue":"4660007","articleId":"4660042","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":4660052,"authors":[{"name":"Dario Pompili","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, State University of New Jersey, Rutgers, Piscataway, NJ, USA"],"firstName":"Dario","lastName":"Pompili","id":"37269715300"},{"name":"Ian F.

Research has high-lighted the interest in developing opportunistic routing schemes, where the next relay is selected dynamically for each packet and each hop. This allows each packet to take advantage of the local pattern of transmissions at any time. The objective of such opportunistic routing schemes is to minimize the end-to-end delay required to carry a packet from the source to the destination. In this paper, we provide upper bounds on the packet propagation speed for opportunistic routing, in a realistic network model where link conditions are variable. We analyze the performance of various opportunistic routing strategies and we compare them with classical routing schemes. The analysis and simulations show that opportunistic routing performs significantly better. We also investigate the effects of mobility. Finally, we present numerical simulations that confirm the accuracy of our bounds.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MAHSS.2008.4660054","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4660007","startPage":"384","endPage":"389","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 5th IEEE International Conference on Mobile Ad Hoc and Sensor Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4653771/4660007/04660054.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Opportunistic routing in wireless ad hoc networks: Upper bounds for the packet propagation speed","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4660054/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 29 2008-Oct. 2 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4660054/","displayDocTitle":"Opportunistic routing in wireless ad hoc networks: Upper bounds for the packet propagation speed","conferenceDate":"29 Sept.-2 Oct. 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2008","accessionNumber":"10385342","dateOfInsertion":"28 October 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Opportunistic routing in wireless ad hoc networks: Upper bounds for the packet propagation speed","confLoc":"Atlanta, GA, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-10242008-00047.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.082893S","chronDate":"Sept. 29 2008-Oct. 2 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4653771","isNumber":"4660007","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4653771","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"4660007","articleId":"4660054","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4660119,"authors":[{"name":"Ting He","affiliation":["IBM Thomas J.

Specifically, a fusion center aims at detecting the presence of transient signals by collecting measurements from individual sensors through erasure channels. Under the assumption that the fusion center can control the sampling procedure through a feedback channel, a strategy is proposed to adapt the sampling rate in response to sample missing with the goal of achieving accurate and timely decisions with the minimum communication cost measured by sampling rate. The proposed strategy is flexible in that it can be configured to suit different performance requirements. Compared with fixed-rate sampling, the proposed strategy achieves better tradeoff between Quality of Detection (QoD) and communication cost through dynamic adaptation.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sensors","Robustness","Delay","Transient analysis","Sensor fusion","Accuracy","Noise"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["AWGN","sampling methods","signal detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive sampling","transient signal detection","missing samples","additive white Gaussian noise","missing signal observations","erasure channels","fusion center","sampling procedure","feedback channel","communication cost","dynamic adaptation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Transient signal detection","adaptive sampling","missing samples"]}],"doi":"10.1109/MAHSS.2008.4660119","publicationTitle":"2008 5th IEEE International Conference on Mobile Ad Hoc and Sensor Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 5th IEEE International Conference on Mobile Ad Hoc and Sensor Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4653771/4660007/04660119.pdf","startPage":"760","endPage":"765","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4660007","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MAHSS.2008.4660119","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive sampling for transient signal detection in the presence of missing samples","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4660119","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive sampling for transient signal detection in the presence of missing samples","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4660119/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4660119/","accessionNumber":"10385407","conferenceDate":"29 Sept.-2 Oct. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"28 October 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 29 2008-Oct. 2 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive sampling for transient signal detection in the presence of missing samples","confLoc":"Atlanta, GA, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-10242008-00112.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049033S","chronDate":"Sept. 29 2008-Oct. 2 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4653771","isNumber":"4660007","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4653771","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4660007","articleId":"4660119","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":4660223,"authors":[{"name":"Daniel J.

In this analysis, binary phase-shift keying format is deployed where the phase is modulated by either a Mach-Zehnder interferometer external phase-modulator or an injection-locking of distributed feedback laser diode's driving current. The performances of the two phase-modulation techniques in the presence of multiple-access interferences in a shot-noise limited regime are studied. Phase limitations and reasonable consequence associated with the limited phase excursion are also investigated.","doi":"10.1109/JLT.2008.919452","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/50/4660221/04660235.pdf","startPage":"2840","endPage":"2847","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JLT.2008.919452","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4660221","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Study of Phase Modulations With Dual-Balanced Detection in Coherent Homodyne Optical CDMA Network","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4660235","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 October 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.15,  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4660235/","displayDocTitle":"Study of Phase Modulations With Dual-Balanced Detection in Coherent Homodyne Optical CDMA Network","volume":"26","issue":"16","publicationDate":"Aug.15, 2008","accessionNumber":"10286822","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4660235/","dateOfInsertion":"28 October 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Study of Phase Modulations With Dual-Balanced Detection in Coherent Homodyne Optical CDMA Network","sourcePdf":"26jlt16-karbassian2.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.081253S","chronDate":"Aug.15,  2008","xplore-pub-id":"50","isNumber":"4660221","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"4660221","articleId":"4660235","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4660237,"authors":[{"name":"Alessandro Massaro","affiliation":["National Nanotechnology Laboratory, CNR-INFM,  Distretto Tecnologico-ISUFI, Universit\u00e0 del Salento, Lecce, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/50/4660221/4660237/4660237-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Alessandro Massaro received the Laurea degree in electronic engineering and the Ph.D. degree in telecommunication engineering from the Universit\u00e0 Politecnica delle Marche, Ancona, Italy, in 2001 and 2004, respectively.","From 2004 to 2006, he was a Research Scientist (postdoctoral) in the Department of Electromagnetism and Bioengineering, Universit\u00e0 Politecnica delle Marche.

This particular PhC geometry has peculiar behavior if compared with the traditional square and triangular lattices, but it is difficult to model by using conventional numerical approaches such as wave expansion method. The resonance and the radiation aspects are analyzed by the 3-D finite-element method (FEM). The model, based on a scattering matrix approach, considers the cavity resonance frequency and evaluates the input-output relationship by enclosing the photonic crystal slab (PhCS) in a black box in order to define the responses at different input-output ports. The scattering matrix method gives important information about the frequency responses of the passive 3-D crystal in the 3-D spatial domain. A high sensitivity of the scattering parameters to the variation of the geometrical imperfection is also observed. The model is completed by the quality factor (Q-factor) estimation. We fabricated the designed circular photonic crystal over a slab membrane waveguide embedding InAs/GaAs quantum dots emitting around 1.28 mum. Good agreement between numerical and experimental results was found, thus validating the 3-D FEM full-wave investigation.","doi":"10.1109/JLT.2008.925035","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/50/4660221/04660237.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JLT.2008.925035","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4660221","startPage":"2960","endPage":"2968","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"3-D FEM Modeling and Fabrication of Circular Photonic Crystal Microcavity","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4660237","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"3-D FEM Modeling and Fabrication of Circular Photonic Crystal Microcavity","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.15,  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4660237/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 October 2008","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"26","issue":"16","publicationDate":"Aug.15, 2008","accessionNumber":"10301351","dateOfInsertion":"28 October 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4660237/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"3-D FEM Modeling and Fabrication of Circular Photonic Crystal Microcavity","sourcePdf":"26jlt16-massaro.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.077938S","chronDate":"Aug.15,  2008","xplore-pub-id":"50","isNumber":"4660221","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"30","xplore-issue":"4660221","articleId":"4660237","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":4660239,"authors":[{"name":"Ademar Muraro","affiliation":["Virtual Engineering Laboratory, Applied Physics Division, Institute of Advanced Studies, Sao Paulo, Brazil"],"bio":{"p":["Ademar Muraro, Jr. received the B.Sc. degree in physics and the M.Sc. degree in electrical engineering from the Universidade de Campinas, S\u00e3o Paolo, Brazil, in 1989 and 1998, respectively.","In 1994, he joined the Institute for Advanced Studies of Aerospace Technical Center (IEAv), Brazil.

The polarization dependence of the gain compression shows that the co-polarized case, in which the pump and probe are TE-polarized, is the optimum for gain switching.

The potential for all-optical switching based on nonlinear polarization rotation (NLPR) induced in the SOA is then assessed through characterization of the dynamics of the state of polarization. It is demonstrated that by careful selection of the orientation of a linear polarizer in front of the detector, it is possible to reduce the recovery time from 100 to 5 ps. The improvement comes about from the selection of the intraband fast gain recovery dynamics. Polarization switching offers potentially faster switching times compared to gain switching as well as an extinction ratio improvement of ~10 dB.","doi":"10.1109/JLT.2008.922326","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JLT.2008.922326","startPage":"2977","endPage":"2985","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/50/4660221/04660244.pdf","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4660221","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Experimental Investigation of Polarization Effects in Semiconductor Optical Amplifiers and Implications for All-Optical Switching","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 October 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.15,  2008","displayDocTitle":"Experimental Investigation of Polarization Effects in Semiconductor Optical Amplifiers and Implications for All-Optical Switching","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug.15, 2008","dateOfInsertion":"28 October 2008","volume":"26","issue":"16","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4660244/","accessionNumber":"10301356","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4660244/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Experimental Investigation of Polarization Effects in Semiconductor Optical Amplifiers and Implications for All-Optical Switching","sourcePdf":"26jlt16-philippe.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.060836S","chronDate":"Aug.15,  2008","xplore-pub-id":"50","isNumber":"4660221","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4660221","articleId":"4660244","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4660282,"authors":[{"name":"Po-Jui Chen","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Division of Engineering and Applied Science, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/84/4681904/4660282/4660282-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Po-Jui Chen (S'03) was born in Taipei, Taiwan, in 1980.

To miniaturize the stimulator output stage two novel techniques are introduced. The first technique is a new current generator circuit reducing to a single step the translation of the digital input bits into the stimulus current, thus minimizing silicon area and power consumption compared to previous works. The current generator uses voltage-controlled resistors implemented by MOS transistors in the deep triode region. The second technique is a new stimulator output stage circuit with blocking-capacitor safety protection using a high-frequency current-switching (HFCS) technique. Unlike conventional stimulator output stage circuits for implantable functional electrical stimulation (FES) systems which require blocking-capacitors in the microfarad range, our proposed approach allows capacitance reduction to the picofarad range, thus the blocking-capacitors can be integrated on-chip. The prototype four-channel neural stimulator chip was fabricated in XFAB's 1-mum silicon-on-insulator CMOS technology and can operate from a power supply between 5-18 V. The stimulus current is generated by active charging and passive discharging. We obtained recordings of action potentials and a strength-duration curve from the sciatic nerve of a frog with the stimulator chip which demonstrate the HFCS technique. The average power consumption for a typical 1-mA 20-Hz single-channel stimulation using a book electrode, is 200 muW from a 6 V power supply.

Only limited work has been reported for assessing video quality under different spatial and temporal resolutions. In this paper, we consider a wider scope of video quality assessment in the sense of considering multiple dimensions. In particular, we address the problem of evaluating perceptual visual quality of low bit-rate videos under different settings and requirements. Extensive subjective view tests for assessing the perceptual quality of low bit-rate videos have been conducted, which cover 150 test scenarios and include five distinctive dimensions: encoder type, video content, bit rate, frame size, and frame rate. Based on the obtained subjective testing results, we perform thorough statistical analysis to study the influence of different dimensions on the perceptual quality and some interesting observations are pointed out. We believe such a study brings new knowledge into the topic of cross-dimensional video quality assessment and it has immediate applications in perceptual video adaptation for scalable video over mobile networks.","doi":"10.1109/TMM.2008.2004910","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Multimedia","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Multimedia","pdfPath":"/iel5/6046/4674662/04660307.pdf","startPage":"1316","endPage":"1324","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMM.2008.2004910","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4674662","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cross-Dimensional Perceptual Quality Assessment for Low Bit-Rate Videos","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4660307","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 October 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4660307/","displayDocTitle":"Cross-Dimensional Perceptual Quality Assessment for Low Bit-Rate Videos","volume":"10","issue":"7","publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","accessionNumber":"10324769","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4660307/","dateOfInsertion":"17 November 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cross-Dimensional Perceptual Quality Assessment for Low Bit-Rate Videos","sourcePdf":"10tmm07-jcai-2004910.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.214811S","chronDate":"Nov.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"6046","isNumber":"4674662","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6046","citationCount":"84","xplore-issue":"4674662","articleId":"4660307","onlineDate":"28 October 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-22"},{"_id":4660310,"authors":[{"name":"Gaurav Bawa","affiliation":["NC-Bionics Laboratory, Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, North Carolina State University, Raleigh, NC, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4156126/4660291/4660310/4660310-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Gaurav Bawa (S'07) was born in Punjab, India, in 1981.

Tendon actuation leads to compression of the manipulator, extension of the actuators, and is limited by the practical constraint that tendons cannot support compression.

We begin from first principles in solid mechanics by analyzing the effects of geometrically nonlinear tendon loads. These loads act both distally at the termination point and proximally along the conduit contact interface. The resulting model simplifies to a linear system including only the bending and axial modes of the manipulator as well as the actuator compliance. The model is then manipulated to form a concise mapping from beam configuration-space parameters to \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">n</i>\n redundant tendon displacements via the internal loads and strains experienced by the system. We demonstrate the utility of this model by implementing an optimal feasible controller. The controller regulates axial strain to a constant value while guaranteeing positive tendon forces and minimizing their magnitudes over a range of articulations.

The accuracy and robustness of the PanTex measure against seasonal changes, multisensor, multiscene, and data degradation by wavelet-based compression and histogram stretching is discussed with some examples. </para>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Robust Built-Up Area Presence Index by Anisotropic Rotation-Invariant Textural Measure","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing","doi":"10.1109/JSTARS.2008.2002869","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4609443/4757309/04660321.pdf","startPage":"180","endPage":"192","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSTARS.2008.2002869","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4757309","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4660321","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4660321/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 October 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2008","displayDocTitle":"A Robust Built-Up Area Presence Index by Anisotropic Rotation-Invariant Textural Measure","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"1","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/4660321/","dateOfInsertion":"23 January 2009","publicationDate":"Sept. 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Robust Built-Up Area Presence Index by Anisotropic Rotation-Invariant Textural Measure","sourcePdf":"01jstars02-mpesaresi-2002869.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.126872S","chronDate":"Sept.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"4609443","isNumber":"4757309","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4609443","citationCount":"214","xplore-issue":"4757309","articleId":"4660321","onlineDate":"28 October 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-29"},{"_id":4660337,"authors":[{"name":"Marianna Beiderman","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Calgary, Calgary, AB, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4156126/4660291/4660337/4660337-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Marianna Beiderman received the B.Sc. degree in industrial engineering from the Technion\u2014Israel Institute of Technology, Haifa, Israel, in 2005.

High-sensitivity, low noise performance of the presented sensor is well-suited for fluorescence imaging. For this purpose, an emission filter was fabricated and integrated with the sensor. The filter was fabricated using PDMS and Sudan II Blue dye mix, spin-coated and deposited in a class 1000 clean room. The designed filter is suitable for excitation at wavelengths below 340 nm and emission at 450 nm and above. The fabricated imager architecture and operation are described, noise analysis is presented and measurements from a test chip are shown. Experimental results using live neurons from the pond snail, Lymnaea stagnalis, and fluorescence polystyrene micro-beads prove the functionality of the fabricated system and indicate its biocompatiblity.","doi":"10.1109/TBCAS.2008.2001866","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4156126/4660291/04660337.pdf","startPage":"193","endPage":"203","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TBCAS.2008.2001866","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4660291","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Low-Light CMOS Contact Imager With an Emission Filter for Biosensing Applications","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4660337/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 October 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2008","displayDocTitle":"A Low-Light CMOS Contact Imager With an Emission Filter for Biosensing Applications","volume":"2","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2008","accessionNumber":"10301362","pubMedId":"23852969","htmlLink":"/document/4660337/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"28 October 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Low-Light CMOS Contact Imager With an Emission Filter for Biosensing Applications","sourcePdf":"tbcas-fish-2001866.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.087678S","chronDate":"Sept.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"4156126","isNumber":"4660291","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4156126","citationCount":"27","xplore-issue":"4660291","articleId":"4660337","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4660348,"authors":[{"name":"R.

This novel approach is based on utilizing characteristic basis functions (CBFs)-special functions defined on macrodomains, or blocks in which the computational domain is discretized by using the DDFD method. The use of the CBFs leads to a significant reduction in the number of unknowns, and results in a substantial size reduction of the DDFD system; this, in turn, enables us to handle the reduced matrix by using an iteration-free direct solver. The reduced sparse matrix system is solved via the Schur complement approach, which reduces the system into many independent smaller subsystems. Two electrostatic problems are used as examples to illustrate the application of the proposed approach. Numerical results that demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of the method are included.","doi":"10.1109/TEMC.2008.2006185","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electromagnetic Compatibility","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electromagnetic Compatibility","pdfPath":"/iel5/15/4669925/04660352.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TEMC.2008.2006185","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4669925","startPage":"946","endPage":"952","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Domain Decomposition Finite-Difference Method Utilizing Characteristic Basis Functions for Solving Electrostatic Problems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4660352","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A Domain Decomposition Finite-Difference Method Utilizing Characteristic Basis Functions for Solving Electrostatic Problems","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4660352/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 October 2008","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"50","issue":"4","publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","accessionNumber":"10313189","dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4660352/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Domain Decomposition Finite-Difference Method Utilizing Characteristic Basis Functions for Solving Electrostatic Problems","sourcePdf":"temc-shao-2006185.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.058783S","chronDate":"Nov.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"15","isNumber":"4669925","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"15","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"4669925","articleId":"4660352","onlineDate":"28 October 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4660353,"authors":[{"name":"Y.

Mean squared error (MSE) is one most widely accepted benchmark for matching accuracy. To avoid multiplication operations for simpler implementation, the sum of absolute difference (SAD) is normally taken as a substitute to approximate MSE. In this paper, we first examine statistically the quantitative deviation of SAD from MSE in terms of maximum and average deviations. To minimize the average deviation, a new measure, namely, weighted sum of absolute difference (WSAD), is proposed in a two-element case first, for which an optimal weight is obtained theoretically. The weight is approximately adapted to 1/2 so that the weighting operation can be simplified to a shift operation, and the resulting multiplication-free WSAD also shows better matching accuracy with a smaller deviation from MSE than SAD. The two-element WSAD is further extended to a multi-element case in a multilevel pyramid structure. The proposed WSAD is experimentally validated by applying it in block motion estimation for video coding, showing better rate-distortion performance than SAD.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/76/4660351/04660367.pdf","startPage":"1441","endPage":"1446","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","doi":"10.1109/TCSVT.2008.2002824","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSVT.2008.2002824","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4660351","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4660367","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A New Multiplication-Free Block Matching Criterion","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Video coding","Computational complexity","Motion estimation","Mean square error methods","PSNR","Hardware","Weight measurement","Rate-distortion","Application software","Computer vision"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","image matching","mean square error methods","motion estimation","rate distortion theory","video coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiplication-free block matching criterion","computational complexity","mean squared error","MSE","video coding","rate-distortion performance","motion estimation","sum-of-absolute difference","SAD"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Block matching","matching criterion","mean square error (MSE)","sum of absolute difference (SAD)","video coding","weighted SAD (WSAD)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4660367/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 October 2008","displayDocTitle":"A New Multiplication-Free Block Matching Criterion","volume":"18","issue":"10","htmlLink":"/document/4660367/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10301289","dateOfInsertion":"28 October 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A New Multiplication-Free Block Matching Criterion","sourcePdf":"18tcsvt10-czhu-2002824.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.100615S","chronDate":"Oct.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"76","isNumber":"4660351","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"76","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"4660351","articleId":"4660367","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":4662500,"authors":[{"name":"Wesley G.

As the community transitions from traditional preventive maintenance procedures to modern predictive or health-based management systems, areas such as efficient online monitoring and diagnosis schemes based on real-time observations have emerged as key research subjects for engineers. Most diagnostic systems require data from both healthy and faulty conditions in order to properly train their classification algorithms. However, in many situations, normal signals are acquired easily while fault samples are difficult to be gained. In this paper, we present a diagnosis scheme based on the least squares support vector machines (LS-SVM). Our modified LS-SVM algorithm is a one-class novelty detector which can differentiate between a normal and faulty condition based only on the normal samples which are easily available. We diagnose a growing crack fault on a planetary gear plate mounted aboard a UH-60 Blackhawk aircraft using this approach. Comparisons drawn with other contemporary approaches lean favorably towards the viability of the suggested novelty detector.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 Sept. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4662612/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10386826","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4662612/","publicationDate":"Sept. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"31 October 2008","conferenceDate":"8-11 Sept. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"An efficient Novelty Detector for online fault diagnosis based on Least Squares Support Vector Machines","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An efficient Novelty Detector for online fault diagnosis based on Least Squares Support Vector Machines","confLoc":"Salt Lake City, UT, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-10222008-00058.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.0419S","chronDate":"8-11 Sept. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4653640","isNumber":"4662554","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4653640","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"4662554","articleId":"4662612","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":4662613,"authors":[{"name":"Greg Sonnenfeld","affiliation":["Mission Critical Technologies, NASA Ames Research Center, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Greg","lastName":"Sonnenfeld","id":"37872354300"},{"name":"Kai Goebel","affiliation":["NASA Ames Research Center, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Kai","lastName":"Goebel","id":"37268804600"},{"name":"Jose R.

Since both the circuit and the circuitpsilas state are stored in radiation-tolerant memory, both could be altered by the harsh space radiation environment. Both the circuit and the circuitpsilas state can be protected by triple-modular redundancy (TMR), but applying TMR to FPGA user designs is often an error-prone process. Faulty application of TMR could cause the FPGA user circuit to output incorrect data. This paper will describe a three-tiered methodology for testing FPGA user designs for space-readiness. We will describe the standard approach to testing FPGA user designs using a particle accelerator, as well as two methods using fault injection and modeling. While accelerator testing is the current ldquogold standardrdquo for pre-launch testing, we believe the use of fault injection and modeling tools allows for easy, cheap and uniform access for discovering errors earlier in the design process.","doi":"10.1109/AUTEST.2008.4662621","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE AUTOTESTCON","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE AUTOTESTCON","pdfPath":"/iel5/4653640/4662554/04662621.pdf","startPage":"252","endPage":"258","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/AUTEST.2008.4662621","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4662554","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4662621","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A test methodology for determining space-readiness of Xilinx SRAM-based FPGA designs","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 Sept. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4662621/","displayDocTitle":"A test methodology for determining space-readiness of Xilinx SRAM-based FPGA designs","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4662621/","publicationDate":"Sept. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"31 October 2008","conferenceDate":"8-11 Sept. 2008","accessionNumber":"10386835","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A test methodology for determining space-readiness of Xilinx SRAM-based FPGA designs","confLoc":"Salt Lake City, UT, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-10222008-00067.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068409S","chronDate":"8-11 Sept. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4653640","isNumber":"4662554","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4653640","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4662554","articleId":"4662621","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4662648,"authors":[{"name":"James P.

It protects the battery from damage, predicts battery life and maintains the battery in an operational condition. The BMS performs these tasks by integrating one or more of the functions, such as protecting the cell, controlling the charge, determining the state of charge (SOC), the state of health (SOH), and the remaining useful life (RUL) of the battery, cell balancing, as well as monitoring and storing historical data. In this paper, we propose a BMS that estimates three critical characteristics of the battery (SOC, SOH, and RUL) using a data-driven approach. Our estimation procedure is based on an equivalent circuit battery model consisting of resistors, capacitor, and Warburg impedance. The resistors usually characterize the self-discharge and internal resistance of the battery, the capacitor generally represents the charge stored in the battery, and the Warburg impedance represents the diffusion phenomenon. We investigate the use of support vector machines to predict the capacity fade and power fade, which characterize the SOH of a battery, as well as estimate the SOC of the battery. The circuit parameters are estimated from Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) test data using non-linear least squares estimation techniques. Predictions of Remaining Useful Life (RUL) of the battery are obtained by support vector regression of the power fade and capacity fade estimates.","doi":"10.1109/AUTEST.2008.4662684","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/AUTEST.2008.4662684","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4662554","startPage":"581","endPage":"586","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE AUTOTESTCON","pdfPath":"/iel5/4653640/4662554/04662684.pdf","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE AUTOTESTCON","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4662684","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Batteries","Resistance","System-on-a-chip","Discharges","Impedance","Integrated circuit modeling","Hafnium"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["battery management systems","battery powered vehicles","electrochemical impedance spectroscopy","equivalent circuits","least squares approximations","remaining life assessment","support vector machines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["automotive battery management systems","battery life prediction","state of charge","state of health","remaining useful life","cell balancing","equivalent circuit battery model","Warburg impedance","support vector machines","capacity fade","power fade","electrochemical impedance spectroscopy","nonlinear least squares estimation","support vector regression"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Battery Management System (BMS)","State of Charge (SOC)","State of Health (SOH)","Power Fade","Capacity Fade","Remaining Useful Life (RUL)","Support Vector Machines (SVM)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Automotive battery management systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 Sept. 2008","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"8-11 Sept. 2008","publicationDate":"Sept. 2008","accessionNumber":"10386892","dateOfInsertion":"31 October 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4662684/","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4662684/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Automotive battery management systems","confLoc":"Salt Lake City, UT, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-10222008-00130.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054392S","chronDate":"8-11 Sept. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4653640","isNumber":"4662554","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4653640","citationCount":"50","xplore-issue":"4662554","articleId":"4662684","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-15"},{"_id":4662699,"authors":[{"name":"Xiangtao Li","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"firstName":"Xiangtao","lastName":"Li","id":"37293191400"},{"name":"Wei-Min Lance Kuo","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"firstName":"Wei-Min Lance","lastName":"Kuo","id":"38182993000"},{"name":"John D.

On the other hand, in the operational range of 30 GS/s and above, the present SiGe THA still exhibits robust characteristics compared to the fastest THAs in terms of linearity, power consumption, and sampling rate.","doi":"10.1109/BIPOL.2008.4662699","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/BIPOL.2008.4662699","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Bipolar/BiCMOS Circuits and Technology Meeting","pdfPath":"/iel5/4655278/4662694/04662699.pdf","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Bipolar/BiCMOS Circuits and Technology Meeting","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4662694","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A 40 GS/s SiGe track-and-hold amplifier","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 Oct. 2008","displayDocTitle":"A 40 GS/s SiGe track-and-hold amplifier","conferenceDate":"13-15 Oct. 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"31 October 2008","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4662699/","accessionNumber":"10392004","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4662699/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A 40 GS/s SiGe track-and-hold amplifier","confLoc":"Monterey, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-10242008-00005.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047438S","chronDate":"13-15 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4655278","isNumber":"4662694","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4655278","citationCount":"24","xplore-issue":"4662694","articleId":"4662699","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4662712,"authors":[{"name":"Donald Y.C.

The chip facilitates cascading of multiple modules via daisy-chaining using the integrated LO power splitter and LO output on the chip edge opposite to the LO input (LO feedthrough). An on-chip differential rat-race coupler provides for separation of transmit (TX) and receive (RX) paths, therefore only a single antenna port is required. The circuit performance is demonstrated in on-board measurements.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Bipolar/BiCMOS Circuits and Technology Meeting","pdfPath":"/iel5/4655278/4662694/04662723.pdf","startPage":"105","endPage":"108","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Bipolar/BiCMOS Circuits and Technology Meeting","doi":"10.1109/BIPOL.2008.4662723","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/BIPOL.2008.4662723","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4662694","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4662723","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A 79-GHz radar transceiver with switchable TX and LO feedthrough in a Silicon-Germanium technology","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Mixers","Frequency measurement","Radar","Transceivers","Power generation","Couplers","Radar antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Ge-Si alloys","radar","semiconductor materials","transceivers","voltage-controlled oscillators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fully-differential single-chip radar transceiver","switchable transmit path","the integrated LO power splitter","on-chip differential rat-race coupler","receive path","transmit path","single antenna port","on-board measurement","frequency 79 GHz","SiGe"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["77GHz","radar","transceiver","switchable TX"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4662723/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 Oct. 2008","displayDocTitle":"A 79-GHz radar transceiver with switchable TX and LO feedthrough in a Silicon-Germanium technology","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4662723/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10387492","dateOfInsertion":"31 October 2008","conferenceDate":"13-15 Oct. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A 79-GHz radar transceiver with switchable TX and LO feedthrough in a Silicon-Germanium technology","confLoc":"Monterey, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-10242008-00029.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059503S","chronDate":"13-15 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4655278","isNumber":"4662694","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4655278","citationCount":"29","xplore-issue":"4662694","articleId":"4662723","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":4662724,"authors":[{"name":"Joel Andrews","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"firstName":"Joel","lastName":"Andrews","id":"37271210000"},{"name":"John D.

Indeed, different topologies of analog-to-digital and digital-to-analog converters are discussed, keeping in mind the very high frequency purpose.

Since the computational capacity of available grid resources tends to be heterogeneous, efficient and effective workflow job scheduling becomes essential. It poses great challenges to achieve minimum job accomplishing time while maintaining high grid resources utilization efficiency. Based on list scheduling and group scheduling, in this paper we propose a novel static scheduling heuristic, called DAGMap. DAGMap consists of three phases, namely prioritizing, grouping, and independent task scheduling. Three salient features of DAGMap are 1) Task grouping is based on dependency relationships and task upward priority; 2) Critical tasks are scheduled first; and 3) Min-Min and Max-Min selective scheduling are used for independent tasks. The experimental results show that DAGMap can achieve better performance than other previous algorithms in terms of makespan, speedup, and efficiency.","doi":"10.1109/GRID.2008.4662778","startPage":"17","publicationTitle":"2008 9th IEEE/ACM International Conference on Grid Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 9th IEEE/ACM International Conference on Grid Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4655284/4662760/04662778.pdf","endPage":"24","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4662760","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GRID.2008.4662778","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"29 Sept.-1 Oct. 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 29 2008-Oct. 1 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4662778/","displayDocTitle":"DAGMap: Efficient scheduling for DAG grid workflow job","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"31 October 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4662778/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10387562","publicationDate":"Sept. 2008","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"DAGMap: Efficient scheduling for DAG grid workflow job","confLoc":"Tsukuba, Japan","sourcePdf":"SPI-10232008-00018.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061272S","chronDate":"Sept. 29 2008-Oct. 1 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4655284","isNumber":"4662760","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4655284","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4662760","articleId":"4662778","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4662791,"authors":[{"name":"Brent Rood","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, State University of New york, Binghamton, Binghamton, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Brent","lastName":"Rood","id":"37660910000"},{"name":"Michael J.

Including reliability requires availability predictors, which consider different periods of resource history, and use various strategies to make predictions about resource behavior. Prediction accuracy significantly affects the quality of the schedule, as does the method by which schedulers combine various factors, including the weight given to predicted availability, speed, load, and more. This paper explores the question of how to consider predicted availability to improve scheduling, concentrating on multi-state availability predictors. We propose and study several classes of schedulers, and a method for combining factors. We characterize the inherent tradeoff between application makespan and the number of evictions due to failure, and demonstrate how our schedulers can navigate this tradeoff under various scenarios. We vary application load and length, and the percentage of jobs that are checkpointable. Our results show that the only other multi-state prediction based scheduler causes up to 51% more evicted jobs while simultaneously increasing average job makespan by 18% when compared with our scheduler.","doi":"10.1109/GRID.2008.4662791","startPage":"126","publicationTitle":"2008 9th IEEE/ACM International Conference on Grid Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 9th IEEE/ACM International Conference on Grid Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4655284/4662760/04662791.pdf","endPage":"135","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4662760","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GRID.2008.4662791","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"29 Sept.-1 Oct. 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 29 2008-Oct. 1 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4662791/","displayDocTitle":"Scheduling on the Grid via multi-state resource availability prediction","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"31 October 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4662791/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10387574","publicationDate":"Sept. 2008","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Scheduling on the Grid via multi-state resource availability prediction","confLoc":"Tsukuba, Japan","sourcePdf":"SPI-10232008-00031.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.081767S","chronDate":"Sept. 29 2008-Oct. 1 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4655284","isNumber":"4662760","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4655284","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"4662760","articleId":"4662791","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4662792,"authors":[{"name":"Issam Al-Azzoni","affiliation":["Department of Computing and Software, McMaster University, Hamilton, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Issam","lastName":"Al-Azzoni","id":"38270278800"},{"name":"Douglas G.

A scheduling policy must be applicable to large-scale systems involving large numbers of machines. Also, the policy must be fault-aware in the sense that it copes with resource volatility. Further adding to the complexity of scheduling for desktop grids is the inherent heterogeneity of such systems. Sub-optimal performance would result if the scheduling policy does not take into account information on heterogeneity.

Their schedulers work with requests that contain imprecise estimations provided by users. This lack of accuracy generates fragments inside the scheduling queues that can be filled by rescheduling both local and multi-site requests. Current resource co-allocation solutions rely on advance reservations to ensure that users can access all the resources at the same time. These coallocation requests cannot be rescheduled if they are based on rigid advance reservations. In this work, we investigate the impact of rescheduling co-allocation requests based on flexible advance reservations and processor remapping. The metascheduler can modify the start time of each job component and remap the number of processors they use in each site. The experimental results show that local jobs may not fill all the fragments in the scheduling queues and hence rescheduling co-allocation requests reduces response time of both local and multi-site jobs. Moreover, we have observed in some scenarios that processor remapping increases the chances of placing the tasks of multi-site jobs into a single cluster, thus eliminating the inter-cluster network overhead.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 29 2008-Oct. 1 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4662793/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4662793/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10387576","conferenceDate":"29 Sept.-1 Oct. 2008","publicationDate":"Sept. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"31 October 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Rescheduling co-allocation requests based on flexible advance reservations and processor remapping","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Rescheduling co-allocation requests based on flexible advance reservations and processor remapping","confLoc":"Tsukuba, Japan","sourcePdf":"SPI-10232008-00033.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.193053S","chronDate":"Sept. 29 2008-Oct. 1 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4655284","isNumber":"4662760","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4655284","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"4662760","articleId":"4662793","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4662842,"authors":[{"name":"Hongbo Tian","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Technology, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Hongbo","lastName":"Tian","id":"37530749800"},{"name":"Xiaoshe Dong","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Technology, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Xiaoshe","lastName":"Dong","id":"37293525200"},{"name":"Yiduo Mei","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Technology, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Yiduo","lastName":"Mei","id":"37533089500"},{"name":"Taiqiang Lv","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Technology, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Taiqiang","lastName":"Lv","id":"37529225200"},{"name":"Xiaoyi Zhao","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Technology, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Xiaoyi","lastName":"Zhao","id":"37539421300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3449-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2160-4908"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2160-4916"}],"articleNumber":"4662842","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":34},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Casting","Particle swarm optimization","Cultural differences","Convergence","Grid computing","Computer science","Fuzzy systems","Neural networks","Genetic algorithms","Network topology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["particle swarm optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["self adaptive casting net","particle swarm optimization","optimization algorithm","global fitness"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)","Casting net","Parameters for self-adaptive"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4662842","abstract":"Prematurity is a troublesome problem that has to be faced and got rid of by many optimization algorithms, especially the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). To combat with prematurity, this paper proposes a self-adaptive casting net mechanism that is able to search global fitness efficiently. To keep diversity of particles, the self-adaptive casting net mechanism tunes parameters dynamically according to the number of iteration. Based on the proposed casting net mechanism, a novel Self-adaptive Casting Net-based Particle Swarm Optimization (SCNPSO) is presented. Experiments were carried out to compare the standard PSO with SCNPSO with various parameters for self-adaptive and different strategies for moving based on benchmark functions of optimization. Experimental results show that SCNPSO outperforms PSO due to adjusting parameters self-adaptively and strategies for moving.","doi":"10.1109/GCC.2008.74","pdfPath":"/iel5/4662825/4662826/04662842.pdf","startPage":"50","endPage":"55","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 Seventh International Conference on Grid and Cooperative Computing","publicationTitle":"2008 Seventh International Conference on Grid and Cooperative Computing","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GCC.2008.74","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4662826","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Novel Self-Adaptive Casting Net-Based Particle Swarm Optimization","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4662842/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-26 Oct. 2008","displayDocTitle":"A Novel Self-Adaptive Casting Net-Based Particle Swarm Optimization","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"31 October 2008","accessionNumber":"10387854","publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4662842/","conferenceDate":"24-26 Oct. 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Novel Self-Adaptive Casting Net-Based Particle Swarm Optimization","confLoc":"Shenzhen, China","sourcePdf":"3449a050.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04962S","chronDate":"24-26 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4662825","isNumber":"4662826","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4662825","xplore-issue":"4662826","articleId":"4662842","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4662849,"authors":[{"name":"Liu Xiaoqian","affiliation":[" Computer Science and Technology, USTC, Hefei, China"],"firstName":"Liu","lastName":"Xiaoqian","id":"37689410400"},{"name":"Yang Shoubao","affiliation":[" Computer Science and Technology, USTC, Hefei, China"],"firstName":"Yang","lastName":"Shoubao","id":"37298161000"},{"name":"Wang Shuling","affiliation":[" Computer Science and Technology, USTC, Hefei, China"],"firstName":"Wang","lastName":"Shuling","id":"37273558200"},{"name":"Xu Jing","affiliation":[" Computer Science and Technology, USTC, Hefei, China"],"firstName":"Xu","lastName":"Jing","id":"37874445700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3449-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2160-4908"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2160-4916"}],"articleNumber":"4662849","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":60},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4662849","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Processor scheduling","Scheduling algorithm","Computer science","Internet","Computer networks","High performance computing","Dynamic scheduling","Grid computing","Risk analysis","Algorithm design and analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["scheduling","task analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["R-DLS algorithm","dynamic-level scheduling algorithm","analytic hierarchy process","resource node","task execution","task scheduling"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["DLS","AHP","R-DLS","task scheduling"]}],"abstract":"As dynamic-level scheduling algorithm does not consider the risk taken by resource nodes and users' demand, it proposes an analytic hierarchy process approach (AHP) based improved DLS algorithm.

However, ONPP can't be implemented effectively due to the high dimensionality. Therefore, a novel method, two-dimensional orthogonal neighborhood preserving projections (2D-ONPP), directly based on 2D image matrices instead of ID vectors, is proposed for face recognition society. It finds an embedding that preserves neighborhood geometrical features and detects the intrinsic image manifold structure. The performance of the proposed algorithm is compared with existing 2D-PCA and ONPP methods on ORL and Yale B databases.

We assign each state of execution an aggregated reliability to measure the probability that the given state will lead to successful execution in the context where each web service may fail with some probability. We show that the computation of aggregated reliabilities is equivalent to eigenvector computation and adopt the power method to efficiently derive aggregated reliabilities. In orchestrating a composite Web service, we propose two strategies to select Web services that are likely to successfully complete the execution of a given sequence of operations. A prototype that implements the proposed approach using BPEL for specifying the invocation order of a web service is developed and served as a testbed for comparing our proposed strategies and other baseline Web service selection strategies.","doi":"10.1109/TSC.2008.2","startPage":"104","endPage":"116","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Services Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4629386/4731205/04663050.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Services Computing","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSC.2008.2","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4731205","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dynamic Web Service Selection for Reliable Web Service Composition","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Web services","Reliability","Communities","Quality of service","Runtime","Planning","Automata"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["finite state machines","software fault tolerance","Web services"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dynamic Web service selection","reliable Web service composition","failure-prone environment","finite state machine","BPEL"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Reliability","Markov processes","Workflow management","Web-based interaction"]},{"kwd":["Reliability","Markov processes","Workflow management","Web-based interaction"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4663050/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"April-June  2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"April-June  2008","displayDocTitle":"Dynamic Web Service Selection for Reliable Web Service Composition","volume":"1","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/4663050/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"April-June 2008","dateOfInsertion":"13 January 2009","accessionNumber":"10457502","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamic Web Service Selection for Reliable Web Service Composition","sourcePdf":"tsc2008020104.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.08158S","chronDate":"April-June  2008","xplore-pub-id":"4629386","isNumber":"4731205","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4629386","citationCount":"139","xplore-issue":"4731205","articleId":"4663050","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":4663060,"authors":[{"name":"Dimitri Tan","affiliation":["PCS-3, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc., Austin, TX, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/12/4740162/4663060/4663060-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Dimitri Tan received the BSEE degree from the University of Adelaide, Australia.

At the same time, there is a conflicting demand in the low-power computing market for a reduction in power consumption. Along with this, there is the absolute necessity of backward compatibility for x86-compatible microprocessors, which includes the support of x87 scientific floating-point instructions. The combined effect is that there is a need for low-power, low-cost floating-point units that are still capable of delivering good SIMD performance while maintaining full x86 functionality. This paper presents the design of an x86-compatible floating-point multiplier (FPM) that is compliant with the IEEE-754 Standard for Binary Floating-Point Arithmetic and is specifically tailored to provide good SIMD performance in a low-cost, low-power solution while maintaining full x87 backward compatibility. The FPM efficiently supports multiple precisions using an iterative rectangular multiplier. The FPM can perform two parallel single-precision multiplies every cycle with a latency of two cycles, one double-precision multiply every two cycles with a latency of four cycles, or one extended-double-precision multiply every three cycles with a latency of five cycles. The iterative FPM also supports division, square-root, and transcendental functions. Compared to a previous design with similar functionality, the proposed iterative FPM has 60 percent less area and 59 percent less dynamic power dissipation.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Low-Power Multiple-Precision Iterative Floating-Point Multiplier with SIMD Support","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","doi":"10.1109/TC.2008.203","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/12/4740162/04663060.pdf","startPage":"175","endPage":"187","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TC.2008.203","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4740162","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4663060","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4663060/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"31 October 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2009","displayDocTitle":"Low-Power Multiple-Precision Iterative Floating-Point Multiplier with SIMD Support","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"58","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/4663060/","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2009","publicationDate":"Feb. 2009","accessionNumber":"10370197","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low-Power Multiple-Precision Iterative Floating-Point Multiplier with SIMD Support","sourcePdf":"ttc2009020175.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.077058S","chronDate":"Feb.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"12","isNumber":"4740162","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"31","xplore-issue":"4740162","articleId":"4663060","onlineDate":"31 October 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4663064,"authors":[{"name":"Yun Wang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Southem Illinois University, Edwardsville, IL, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/71/5226185/4663064/4663064-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yun Wang received the BS degree in computer science and engineering from Wuhan University, Hubei, China, in 2001 and the PhD degree in computer science and engineering from the University of Cincinnati, Ohio, in 2008.

In this paper, a novel range-free localization algorithm using expected hop progress (LAEP) to predict the location of any sensor in a WSN is proposed. This algorithm is based on an accurate analysis of hop progress in a WSN with randomly deployed sensors and arbitrary node density. By deriving the expected hop progress from a network model for WSNs in terms of network parameters, the distance between any pair of sensors can be accurately computed. Since the distance estimation is a key issue in localization systems for WSNs, the proposed range-free LAEP achieves better performance and less communication overhead as compared to some existent schemes like DV-Hop and RAW. In addition, we study the effect of anchor placement on the algorithm performance by deriving the corresponding mean position error range. Extensive simulations are performed and the results are observed to be in good agreement with the theoretical analysis.","doi":"10.1109/TPDS.2008.239","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/71/5226185/04663064.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPDS.2008.239","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5226185","startPage":"1540","endPage":"1552","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Range-Free Localization Using Expected Hop Progress in Wireless Sensor Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4663064","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Range-Free Localization Using Expected Hop Progress in Wireless Sensor Networks","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4663064/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"31 October 2008","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"20","issue":"10","publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","accessionNumber":"10847482","dateOfInsertion":"28 August 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4663064/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Range-Free Localization Using Expected Hop Progress in Wireless Sensor Networks","sourcePdf":"ttd2009101540.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.087114S","chronDate":"Oct.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"71","isNumber":"5226185","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"71","citationCount":"143","xplore-issue":"5226185","articleId":"4663064","onlineDate":"31 October 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4663071,"authors":[{"name":"Hongwei Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Wayne State University, Detroit, MI, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Hongwei Zhangs's photograph and biography not available."]},"firstName":"Hongwei","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37280792500"},{"name":"Anish Arora","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Ohio State Uinversity, Columbus, OH, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Anish Arora's photograph and biography not available."]},"firstName":"Anish","lastName":"Arora","id":"37270907300"},{"name":"Prasun Sinha","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Ohio State Uinversity, Columbus, OH, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Prasun Sinha's photograph and biography not available."]},"firstName":"Prasun","lastName":"Sinha","id":"37287996600"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1536-1233"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-0660"},{"format":"CD","value":"2161-9875"}],"articleNumber":"4663071","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":23,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":374},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computer Society","url":"http://www.computer.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Spine","Unicast","Broadcasting","Testing","Telecommunication traffic","Routing protocols","Feedback","Data communication","Delay","Energy efficiency"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["access protocols","routing protocols","telecommunication traffic","wireless LAN","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data-driven routing protocol","link estimation","MAC feedback","unicast data transmission","broadcast beacon","sensor network traffic trace","learn-on-the-fly","geography-unaware ETX","geography-based PRD"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Routing protocols","Sensor networks","Algorithm/protocol design and analysis"]},{"kwd":["Routing protocols","Sensor networks","Algorithm/protocol design and analysis"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4663071","abstract":"In the context of IEEE 802.11b network testbeds, we examine the differences between unicast and broadcast link properties, and we show the inherent difficulties in precisely estimating unicast link properties via those of broadcast beacons even if we make the length and transmission rate of beacons be the same as those of data packets. To circumvent the difficulties in link estimation, we propose to estimate unicast link properties directly via data traffic itself without using periodic beacons. To this end, we design a data-driven routing protocol Learn-on-the-Fly (LOF). LOF chooses routes based on ETX/ETT-type metrics, but the metrics are estimated via MAC feedback for unicast data transmission instead of broadcast beacons. Using a realistic sensor network traffic trace and an 802.11b testbed of ~195 Stargates, we experimentally compare the performance of LOF with that of beacon-based protocols, represented by the geography-unaware ETX and the geography-based PRD. We find that LOF reduces end-to-end MAC latency by a factor of 3, enhances energy efficiency by a factor up to 2.37, and improves network throughput by a factor up to 7.78, which demonstrate the feasibility and the potential benefits of data-driven link estimation and routing.","doi":"10.1109/TMC.2008.155","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMC.2008.155","startPage":"653","endPage":"667","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/7755/4804305/04663071.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4804305","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Link Estimation and Routing in Sensor Network Backbones: Beacon-Based or Data-Driven?","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"31 October 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2009","displayDocTitle":"Link Estimation and Routing in Sensor Network Backbones: Beacon-Based or Data-Driven?","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2009","dateOfInsertion":"21 March 2009","volume":"8","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4663071/","accessionNumber":"10520186","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4663071/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Link Estimation and Routing in Sensor Network Backbones: Beacon-Based or Data-Driven?","sourcePdf":"ttm2009050653.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.095782S","chronDate":"May  2009","xplore-pub-id":"7755","isNumber":"4804305","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7755","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"4804305","articleId":"4663071","onlineDate":"31 October 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4663075,"authors":[{"name":"Chrysostomos Nicopoulos","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Cyprus, Nicosia, Cyprus"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8858/5550969/4663075/4663075-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Chrysostomos Nicopoulos received the BS and PhD degrees in electrical engineering (specializing in computer engineering) from Pennsylvania State University, University Park, in 2003 and 2007, respectively.

Burgeoning transistor counts are casting a dark shadow on modern chip design: global interconnect delays are dominating gate delays and affecting overall system performance. Networks-on-Chip (NoC) are viewed as a viable solution to this problem because of their scalability and optimized electrical properties. However, on-chip routers are susceptible to another artifact of deep submicron technology, Process Variation (PV). PV is a consequence of manufacturing imperfections, which may lead to degraded performance and even erroneous behavior. In this work, we present the first comprehensive evaluation of NoC susceptibility to PV effects, and we propose an array of architectural improvements in the form of a new router design-called SturdiSwitch-to increase resiliency to these effects. Through extensive reengineering of critical components, SturdiSwitch provides increased immunity to PV while improving performance and increasing area and power efficiency.","doi":"10.1109/TDSC.2008.59","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Dependable and Secure Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Dependable and Secure Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/8858/5550969/04663075.pdf","startPage":"240","endPage":"254","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TDSC.2008.59","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5550969","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the Effects of Process Variation in Network-on-Chip Architectures","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4663075","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"31 October 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"July-Sept.  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4663075/","displayDocTitle":"On the Effects of Process Variation in Network-on-Chip Architectures","volume":"7","issue":"3","publicationDate":"July-Sept. 2010","accessionNumber":"11476881","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4663075/","dateOfInsertion":"19 August 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the Effects of Process Variation in Network-on-Chip Architectures","sourcePdf":"ttq2010030240.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.117564S","chronDate":"July-Sept.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"8858","isNumber":"5550969","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8858","citationCount":"43","xplore-issue":"5550969","articleId":"4663075","onlineDate":"31 October 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-28"},{"_id":4663083,"authors":[{"name":"Jiangbo Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Michigan State University, Michigan"],"bio":{"p":["Jiangbo Zhang (zhangj15@egr.msu.edu) is working toward his Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering at Michigan State University, East Lansing, Michigan."]},"firstName":"Jiangbo","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37293674800"},{"name":"Ning Xi","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Michigan State University, Michigan"],"bio":{"p":["Ning Xi (xin@egr.msu.edu) is the John D.

The CID models seek to unify the color image representation and recognition tasks into one framework. The proposed models, therefore, involve two sets of variables: a set of color component combination coefficients for color image representation and one or multiple projection basis vectors for color image discrimination. An iterative basic CID algorithm and its general version are designed to find the optimal solution of the proposed models. The general CID (GCID) algorithm is further extended to generate three color components (such as the three color components of the RGB color images) for further improvement of the recognition performance. Experiments using the face recognition grand challenge (FRGC) database and the biometric experimentation environment (BEE) system show the effectiveness of the proposed models and algorithms. In particular, for the most challenging FRGC version 2 Experiment 4, which contains 12\u2009776 training images, 16\u2009028 controlled target images, and 8014 uncontrolled query images, the proposed method achieves the face verification rate (ROC III) of 78.26% at the false accept rate (FAR) of 0.1%. </para>","doi":"10.1109/TNN.2008.2003187","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/72/4686035/04663106.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNN.2008.2003187","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4686035","startPage":"2088","endPage":"2098","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Color Image Discriminant Models and Algorithms for Face Recognition","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4663106","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Color Image Discriminant Models and Algorithms for Face Recognition","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4663106/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"31 October 2008","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"19","issue":"12","publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","pubMedId":"19054733","dateOfInsertion":"02 December 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4663106/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Color Image Discriminant Models and Algorithms for Face Recognition","sourcePdf":"tnn-yang-2003187.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.141334S","chronDate":"Dec.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"72","isNumber":"4686035","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"72","citationCount":"76","xplore-issue":"4686035","articleId":"4663106","onlineDate":"31 October 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-24"},{"_id":4663112,"authors":[{"name":"Wei-Neng Chen","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5326/4735634/4663112/4663112-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Wei-Neng Chen (S\u201907) received the Bachelor's degree in network engineering in 2006 from Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangdong, China, where he is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree in the Department of Computer Science.","His current research interests include ant colony optimization, genetic algorithms, and other computational intelligence techniques, and also the applications of project scheduling and financial management."]},"firstName":"Wei-Neng","lastName":"Chen","id":"37834282900"},{"name":"Jun Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5326/4735634/4663112/4663112-photo-2-source-small.gif","p":["Jun Zhang (M'02\u2014SM'08) received the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from the City University of Hong Kong, Kowloon, Hong Kong, in 2002.","From 2003 to 2004, he was a Brain Korean 21 Postdoctoral Fellow in the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology.

In grid environments, applications are always regarded as workflows. The problem of scheduling workflows in terms of certain quality of service (QoS) requirements is challenging and it significantly influences the performance of grids. By now, there have been some algorithms for grid workflow scheduling, but most of them can only tackle the problems with a single QoS parameter or with small-scale workflows. In this frame, this paper aims at proposing an ant colony optimization (ACO) algorithm to schedule large-scale workflows with various QoS parameters. This algorithm enables users to specify their QoS preferences as well as define the minimum QoS thresholds for a certain application. The objective of this algorithm is to find a solution that meets all QoS constraints and optimizes the user-preferred QoS parameter. Based on the characteristics of workflow scheduling, we design seven new heuristics for the ACO approach and propose an adaptive scheme that allows artificial ants to select heuristics based on pheromone values. Experiments are done in ten workflow applications with at most 120 tasks, and the results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.","doi":"10.1109/TSMCC.2008.2001722","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4735634","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSMCC.2008.2001722","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part C (Applications and Reviews)","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part C (Applications and Reviews)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5326/4735634/04663112.pdf","startPage":"29","endPage":"43","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Ant Colony Optimization Approach to a Grid Workflow Scheduling Problem With Various QoS Requirements","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"31 October 2008","displayDocTitle":"An Ant Colony Optimization Approach to a Grid Workflow Scheduling Problem With Various QoS Requirements","volume":"39","issue":"1","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2009","dateOfInsertion":"30 December 2008","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4663112/","publicationDate":"Jan. 2009","accessionNumber":"10370677","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4663112/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Ant Colony Optimization Approach to a Grid Workflow Scheduling Problem With Various QoS Requirements","sourcePdf":"tsmcc-zhang-2001722.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.082473S","chronDate":"Jan.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"5326","isNumber":"4735634","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5326","citationCount":"215","xplore-issue":"4735634","articleId":"4663112","onlineDate":"31 October 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-24"},{"_id":4663130,"authors":[{"name":"Dominik Bortis","affiliation":["Power Electronic Systems Laboratory (PES), Swiss Federal Institute of Technology of Z\u00fcrich, Zurich, Switzerland"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/27/4675197/4663130/4663130-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Dominik Bortis (S'06) received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering, major in communication technology and automatic control engineering, in 2003 and the M.Sc. degree in 2005 from the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (ETH), Z\u00fcrich, Switzerland, where he is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree.","After the internship at Asea Brown Bowery, where he designed an ac/dc power supply for synchronizing systems, he did his master thesis in cooperation with Levitronix Company, Z\u00fcrich, where he designed and realized a galvanic isolation system for analog signals.

In order to increase the pulsed power, solid-state switches have to be connected in series or in parallel. Depending on the interconnection of the switches, parameter variations in the switches and in the system can lead to an unbalanced voltage or current. Therefore, the switches are generally derated, which results in an increased number of required devices, cost, and volume. With an active gate control, derating and preselection of the switching devices can be avoided. In this paper, an active gate control of paralleled IGBT modules, which has been developed for converters with inductive load, is explained in detail and adapted to a solid-state modulator. This paper focuses on achieving a low-inductance IGBT current measurement, the control unit implementation with a field-programmable gate array and a digital signal processor, as well as the balancing of the pulse currents.","doi":"10.1109/TPS.2008.2003971","startPage":"2632","endPage":"2637","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Plasma Science","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPS.2008.2003971","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4675197","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Plasma Science","pdfPath":"/iel5/27/4675197/04663130.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Active Gate Control for Current Balancing of Parallel-Connected IGBT Modules in Solid-State Modulators","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4663130/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Active Gate Control for Current Balancing of Parallel-Connected IGBT Modules in Solid-State Modulators","volume":"36","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/4663130/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10313015","publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"17 November 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"31 October 2008","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Active Gate Control for Current Balancing of Parallel-Connected IGBT Modules in Solid-State Modulators","sourcePdf":"tps-bortis-2003971.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.05757S","chronDate":"Oct.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"27","isNumber":"4675197","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"27","citationCount":"78","xplore-issue":"4675197","articleId":"4663130","onlineDate":"31 October 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":4663147,"authors":[{"name":"James E.

Vacuum arc discharges exhibit certain regularities in their behavior that allow the performance of these thrusters to be described by simple semiempirical models. Empirical data on the current density distribution, charge state and velocity of ions created in vacuum arc discharges, and the total cathode mass loss rate are used to develop expressions for the expected thrust and specific impulse as a function of thruster geometry. Thruster electrical efficiency and thrust-to-power ratio are calculated based on measurements of the burning voltage for given thruster operating parameters. Estimates of achievable thruster performance for a wide range of cathode materials are presented. This analysis suggests that thrusters using vacuum arc sources can be operated efficiently with a range of propellant options that gives great flexibility in specific impulse. In addition, the efficiency of plasma production in these devices appears to be largely independent of scale because the metal vapor is ionized within tens of micrometers of the cathode electron emission sites, so this approach is well suited for micropropulsion.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4663147/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"31 October 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2008","volume":"36","issue":"5","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10312998","dateOfInsertion":"17 November 2008","publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4663147/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A Theoretical Analysis of Vacuum Arc Thruster and Vacuum Arc Ion Thruster Performance","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Theoretical Analysis of Vacuum Arc Thruster and Vacuum Arc Ion Thruster Performance","sourcePdf":"tps-polk-2004374.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.161469S","chronDate":"Oct.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"27","isNumber":"4674691","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"27","citationCount":"51","xplore-issue":"4674691","articleId":"4663147","onlineDate":"31 October 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4663164,"authors":[{"name":"G.

Numerical simulations are carried out using barium strontium titanate as the dielectric system. The concept is based on using the nonlinear voltage-dependent capacitance of the granular material. The presence of internal grains increases the breakdown strength and also provides for a nonlinear voltage-dependent capacitance that depends on the internal grain size. The output characteristics of transmission lines based on such nonlinear material are simulated. Our results clearly demonstrated rise-time shortening.

There are two difficulties in this design problem: (1) too few control inputs will not generally allow independent control over all outputs and (2) the state of the system is not available for measurements, and only the outputs are available through measurements. To address the first issue, a practical output feedback control problem is formulated, aiming to regulate only part of the outputs, and a controller structure with two design components in all or some chosen control inputs is proposed. To cope with the second difficulty, the recently developed high-order sliding mode differentiators (HOSMDs) are used to estimate the derivatives of the outputs needed in the controller design. With the derivatives estimated using HOSMDs, an output feedback controller is designed using the backstepping approach. Stability results are established for the designed controller under certain conditions. In order to test the applicability of the proposed output feedback controller in practical industrial problems, experiments are carried out though implementing the controller on a laboratory-scale 3-D crane. The experimental results are presented and reveal the advantage of the proposed controller structure, as well as the effect of controller gain and sampling periods.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/41/4663160/04663182.pdf","startPage":"3985","endPage":"3997","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2008.2004384","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2008.2004384","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4663160","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4663182","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Output Feedback Controller Design for a Class of MIMO Nonlinear Systems Using High-Order Sliding-Mode Differentiators With Application to a Laboratory 3-D Crane","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Output feedback","Nonlinear control systems","Sliding mode control","Control systems","MIMO","Nonlinear systems","Laboratories","Cranes","Control design","Backstepping"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["control system synthesis","cranes","feedback","laboratories","MIMO systems","nonlinear control systems","robust control","variable structure systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["output feedback controller design","MIMO nonlinear systems","multi input-multi output","high-order sliding-mode differentiators","laboratory-scale 3D crane","HOSMD","backstepping approach","practical industrial problems","controller gain"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Backstepping","high-order sliding mode","nonlinear systems","output feedback control"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4663182/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"31 October 2008","displayDocTitle":"Output Feedback Controller Design for a Class of MIMO Nonlinear Systems Using High-Order Sliding-Mode Differentiators With Application to a Laboratory 3-D Crane","volume":"55","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/4663182/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","accessionNumber":"10301395","dateOfInsertion":"31 October 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Output Feedback Controller Design for a Class of MIMO Nonlinear Systems Using High-Order Sliding-Mode Differentiators With Application to a Laboratory 3-D Crane","sourcePdf":"tie-saif-2004384.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.12456S","chronDate":"Nov.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"4663160","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"53","xplore-issue":"4663160","articleId":"4663182","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4663190,"authors":[{"name":"Lionel Lapierre","affiliation":["Laboratoire d''Informatique de Robotique et de Micro\u00e9lectronique de Montpellier, Montpellier, France"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/48/4663184/4663190/4663190-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Lionel Lapierre received the Ph.D. degree robotics from the University of Montpellier 2, Montpellier, France, in 1999.","Then, he joined the team of Prof. A.

Robustness to vehicle parameter uncertainty is addressed by incorporating a hybrid parameter adaptation scheme. The resulting nonlinear adaptive control system is formally shown and it yields asymptotic convergence of the vehicle to the path.

This paper proposes a spatial hidden Markov model (SHMM) to learn the normal patterns of network-wide traffic. Combined with topology information, SHMM models traffic volumes on links as probabilistic outputs of underlying interactions between routers. Based on a trained SHMM, a nonparametric CUSUM algorithm is used to track the change of entropy of observation sequences in different sliding windows for anomaly detection. Background traffic collected from real network and synthetic anomalies are used for validation of the detection method. The results prove our method effective for network-wide traffic anomaly detection.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IFIP International Conference on Network and Parallel Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4663277/4663278/04663324.pdf","startPage":"198","endPage":"203","publicationTitle":"2008 IFIP International Conference on Network and Parallel Computing","doi":"10.1109/NPC.2008.89","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NPC.2008.89","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4663278","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4663324","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Detecting Network-Wide Traffic Anomalies Based on Spatial HMM","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Telecommunication traffic","Hidden Markov models","Traffic control","Communication system traffic control","Network topology","Parallel processing","Helium","Sun","Pattern analysis","Change detection algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hidden Markov models","Internet","security of data","telecommunication network topology","telecommunication traffic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["network-wide traffic anomalies","traffic temporal patterns","single network element","network-wide traffic analysis","spatial hidden Markov model","topology information","traffic volumes","anomaly detection"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["network-wide","anomaly detection","HMM"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4663324/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 Oct. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Detecting Network-Wide Traffic Anomalies Based on Spatial HMM","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4663324/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10392229","dateOfInsertion":"31 October 2008","conferenceDate":"18-21 Oct. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Detecting Network-Wide Traffic Anomalies Based on Spatial HMM","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"3354a198.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050682S","chronDate":"18-21 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4663277","isNumber":"4663278","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4663277","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4663278","articleId":"4663324","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4663334,"authors":[{"name":"Yanbing Liu","firstName":"Yanbing","lastName":"Liu","id":"37879340400"},{"name":"Jun Huang","firstName":"Jun","lastName":"Huang","id":"37881301600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3354-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4663334","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":147},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Genetic algorithms","Cities and towns","Traveling salesman problems","Parallel processing","Neural networks","Genetic mutations","Circuit testing","Particle swarm optimization","Equations","Computational modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithms","travelling salesman problems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithm","local search ability","traveling salesman problem"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["genetic algorithm","TSP","optimization"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4663334","abstract":"A novel was proposed for the defections of slow convergence and liable to \"premature\" of traditional GA.

We illustrate the application of the model with a preliminary study of a system designed to encourage green computing and we present some preliminary simulation results of the model.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4663419/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-24 Oct. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10388160","htmlLink":"/document/4663419/","dateOfInsertion":"31 October 2008","conferenceDate":"20-24 Oct. 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A Self-Organization Model for Complex Computing and Communication Systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Self-Organization Model for Complex Computing and Communication Systems","confLoc":"Venezia, Italy","sourcePdf":"3404a149.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059299S","chronDate":"20-24 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4663390","isNumber":"4663391","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4663390","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"4663391","articleId":"4663419","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4663483,"authors":[{"name":"Ali Y.

In this paper, we examine closed-loop OFDM systems and show how uniform pilots may no longer be optimal. In doing so, we propose a feedback technique in which the pilot allocation mechanism is adapted to the mobile channel. After deriving a general expression for the symbol error rate as a function of pilot allocation, we optimize the pilot locations and propose two practical solutions using bounds on the objective function. We proceed to formulate pilot allocation based on the maximal average OFDM channel capacity. We examine the feedback overhead that is associated with our method and make comparisons with the conventional uniform framework. Finally, we suggest the use of vector quantization in the context of the generalized Lloyd algorithm to reduce feedback and extend our method to a multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO)-OFDM system based on the Alamouti space-time block code. Monte-Carlo simulations illustrate the error-rate/capacity performance gains via nonuniform pilots and illustrate the effects of Doppler frequency and carrier frequency offset.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2008.2008655","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/5062310/04663483.pdf","startPage":"2803","endPage":"2814","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2008.2008655","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5062310","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimizing Pilot Locations Using Feedback in OFDM Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4663483","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"31 October 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4663483/","displayDocTitle":"Optimizing Pilot Locations Using Feedback in OFDM Systems","volume":"58","issue":"6","publicationDate":"July 2009","accessionNumber":"10712962","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4663483/","dateOfInsertion":"02 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimizing Pilot Locations Using Feedback in OFDM Systems","sourcePdf":"tvt-panah-2008655.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.093878S","chronDate":"July  2009","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"5062310","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"5062310","articleId":"4663483","onlineDate":"31 October 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4663485,"authors":[{"name":"Zhi Quan","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of California, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/4773578/4663485/4663485-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Zhi Quan received the B.E. degree in communication engineering from Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, China, and the M.S. degree in electrical engineering from Oklahoma State University, Stillwater.","He is working toward the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA).

In this model, the antenna array is represented by an equivalent single-port antenna and the multiport active beamforming network is replaced by an equivalent two-port amplifier. Herein, the beam sensitivity is defined at the input of the receiving system and is a function of the equivalent antenna model parameters. Such a simplified representation helps us to identify the predominant factors that affect the receiver sensitivity of complex antenna array systems, without having to consider the entire system in full detail. The receiver noise is computed with the proposed model and compared to the one computed by a direct numerical method to validate its consistency. For this purpose, we consider a four-element actively beamformed dipole array with strongly coupled antenna elements causing significant noise coupling effects.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4663504/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"31 October 2008","volume":"7","accessionNumber":"10478061","publicationDate":"2008","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4663504/","dateOfInsertion":"23 January 2009","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Equivalent System Representation to Model the Beam Sensitivity of Receiving Antenna Arrays","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Equivalent System Representation to Model the Beam Sensitivity of Receiving Antenna Arrays","sourcePdf":"lawp-ivashina-2006917.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.052445S","chronDate":"2008","xplore-pub-id":"7727","isNumber":"4446029","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7727","citationCount":"51","xplore-issue":"4446029","articleId":"4663504","onlineDate":"31 October 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4663506,"authors":[{"name":"Chunna Zhang","affiliation":["University of Tennessee, Knoxville, TN, USA"],"firstName":"Chunna","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37288988900"},{"name":"Songnan Yang","affiliation":["University of Tennessee, Knoxville, TN, USA"],"firstName":"Songnan","lastName":"Yang","id":"37292119700"},{"name":"Samir El-Ghazaly","affiliation":["University of Arkansas, Fayetteville, AK, USA"],"firstName":"Samir","lastName":"El-Ghazaly","id":"37266744900"},{"name":"Aly E.

The algorithm is based on a generative model for the surface EMG. The model assumes that synergistic muscles share spinal neural drives, which correspond to the intended activations of different DOFs of natural movements and are embedded within the surface EMG. A DOF-wise nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) is developed to estimate neural control information from the multichannel surface EMG. It is shown, both by simulation and experimental studies, that the proposed algorithm is able to extract the multidimensional control information simultaneously. A direct application of the proposed method would be providing simultaneous and proportional control of multifunction myoelectric prostheses.","doi":"10.1109/TBME.2008.2007967","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/10/4909410/04663628.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TBME.2008.2007967","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4909410","startPage":"1070","endPage":"1080","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Extracting Simultaneous and Proportional Neural Control Information for Multiple-DOF Prostheses From the Surface Electromyographic Signal","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4663628","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Extracting Simultaneous and Proportional Neural Control Information for Multiple-DOF Prostheses From the Surface Electromyographic Signal","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4663628/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"31 October 2008","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"56","issue":"4","publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10628345","pubMedId":"19272889","dateOfInsertion":"05 May 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4663628/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Extracting Simultaneous and Proportional Neural Control Information for Multiple-DOF Prostheses From the Surface Electromyographic Signal","sourcePdf":"tbme-jiang-2007967.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.086974S","chronDate":"April  2009","xplore-pub-id":"10","isNumber":"4909410","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"292","xplore-issue":"4909410","articleId":"4663628","onlineDate":"31 October 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4663635,"authors":[{"name":"Tulaya Limpiti","affiliation":["University of Wisconsin Madison, Madison, WI, US"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/10/4838904/4663635/4663635-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Tulaya Limpiti (S'02\u2013M'08) received the B.S. degree (with highest honors) from Northwestern University, Evanston, IL, in 2002, and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees from the University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison, Madison, WI, in 2004 and 2008, respectively, all in electrical engineering.","She is currently a Postdoctoral Researcher at the University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison.

Spatial and temporal bases capture the aspects of the response that are consistent across trials, while the basis expansion coefficients represent the variable components of the response. We focus on the simplest case of constant spatiotemporal response shape and varying amplitude across trials. Two different constraints on the amplitude evolution are employed to effectively integrate the individual responses and improve robustness at low SNR. The linear dynamical system response constraint estimates the current trial amplitude as an unknown constant scaling of the estimate in the previous trial plus zero-mean Gaussian noise with unknown variance. The independent response constraint estimates response amplitudes across trials as independent Gaussian random variables having unknown mean and variance. We develop a generalized expectation-maximization algorithm to obtain the maximum-likelihood (ML) estimates of the signal waveform, noise covariance matrix, and unknown constraint parameters. ML source localization is achieved by scanning the likelihood over different sets of spatial bases. We demonstrate the variability estimation and source localization effectiveness of the proposed algorithms using both real and simulated ER data.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Spatiotemporal phenomena","Amplitude estimation","Electroencephalography","Erbium","Maximum likelihood estimation","Shape","Noise robustness","Signal to noise ratio","Gaussian noise","Random variables"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bioelectric potentials","covariance matrices","electroencephalography","expectation-maximisation algorithm","Gaussian noise","magnetoencephalography","spatiotemporal phenomena"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["spatiotemporal framework","trial-to-trial amplitude variation","event-related MEG","event-related EEG","expansion coefficient","linear dynamical system response","Gaussian random variables","generalized expectation-maximization algorithm","maximum-likelihood estimation","signal waveform","noise covariance matrix","source localization effectiveness"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Event-related magnetoencephalography (MEG)/electroencephalography (EEG)","expectation-maximization (EM)","independent response (IR)","linear dynamical system response (LDSR)","maximum likelihood (ML)","trial-to-trial variability"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Algorithms","Brain","Brain Mapping","Computer Simulation","Electroencephalography","Evoked Potentials","Humans","Linear Models","Magnetoencephalography","Models, Statistical","Normal Distribution","Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TBME.2008.2008423","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/10/4838904/04663635.pdf","startPage":"633","endPage":"645","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4838904","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TBME.2008.2008423","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Spatiotemporal Framework for Estimating Trial-to-Trial Amplitude Variation in Event-Related MEG/EEG","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4663635","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A Spatiotemporal Framework for Estimating Trial-to-Trial Amplitude Variation in Event-Related MEG/EEG","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4663635/","volume":"56","issue":"3","publicationDate":"March 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4663635/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"10587513","pubMedId":"19272883","dateOfInsertion":"21 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"31 October 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Spatiotemporal Framework for Estimating Trial-to-Trial Amplitude Variation in Event-Related MEG/EEG","sourcePdf":"tbme-limpiti-2008423.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.203724S","chronDate":"March  2009","xplore-pub-id":"10","isNumber":"4838904","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"4838904","articleId":"4663635","onlineDate":"31 October 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4663638,"authors":[{"name":"Abdur Rub Abdur Rahman","affiliation":["Bio-Microelectromechanical Systems (MEMS) and Microsystems Laboratory, Department of Electrical Engineering, University of South Florida, Tampa, FL, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/10/4808337/4663638/4663638-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Abdur Rub Abdur Rahman received the B.E. degree in electrical and electronics from the University of Madras, Chennai, India, in 1997, and the M.S. degree in electrical engineering with specialization in microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) from the University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, OH, in 2000.

A commercially available eight-well cell culture impedance array (ECIS-8W1E), commonly used in electrical cell-substrate impedance sensing (ECIS), was used for OVCA429 characterization. Impedances of ECIS-8W1E array were recorded with cell culture medium (without cells) and with OVCA429 cell layer in the culture medium between 100 Hz and 10 MHz frequency. Physiological and interfacial components of experimental impedance data were modeled by equivalent circuit fitting, using a newly developed model. Impedance measurements with cell culture medium show only two semicircles in the admittance plane, which are identified as: 1) low-frequency semicircle due to impedance of gold electrode in contact with the electrolyte and 2) high-frequency semicircle due to impedance of polymer-coated region of the gold electrode in contact with the electrolyte. In the presence of OVCA429 cell layer, three convolved semicircles are observed in the Cole-Cole plane, which are identified as the interfacial impedance in series with the cell layer impedance.

Thus, it is suitable for very large scale integration implementation. The LN-CNN functions of diffusion, deblurring, and Muller-Lyer illusion are successfully verified. Meanwhile, the functions of erosion and dilation are expanded with the diamond-shaped LN templates. Furthermore, the simple N- and P-type synapses stop all the static current paths so that the dc power dissipation can be reduced to only 0.7 mW on standby and 18 mW in operation. An experimental LN-CNN chip with a 20 \u00d7 20 array has been fabricated using 0.18-mum CMOS technology.

Several examples, including variable fan filters, variable circularly symmetric filters, and variable elliptically symmetric filters with arbitrary orientation, are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness and the flexibility of the presented method.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design of Variable Two-Dimensional FIR Digital Filters by McClellan Transformation","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","doi":"10.1109/TCSI.2008.2002119","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","pdfPath":"/iel5/8919/4799355/04663646.pdf","startPage":"574","endPage":"582","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSI.2008.2002119","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4799355","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4663646","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4663646/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"31 October 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2009","displayDocTitle":"Design of Variable Two-Dimensional FIR Digital Filters by McClellan Transformation","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"56","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/4663646/","dateOfInsertion":"10 March 2009","publicationDate":"March 2009","accessionNumber":"10543356","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design of Variable Two-Dimensional FIR Digital Filters by McClellan Transformation","sourcePdf":"tcsi-jshyu-2002119.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.066955S","chronDate":"March  2009","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"4799355","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"26","xplore-issue":"4799355","articleId":"4663646","onlineDate":"31 October 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4663648,"authors":[{"name":"He Huang","affiliation":["Department of Manufacturing Engineering and Engineering Management, City University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8919/4813280/4663648/4663648-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["He Huang received the B.S. degree in mathematics from Gannan Normal University, Ganzhou, China, in 2000 and the M.S. degree in applied mathematics from Southeast University, Nanjing, China, in 2003.

The mechanisms for the NL are exponential settling, amplitude modulation, phase modulation, and discrete-time modulation.

The application of the model is reduced to the equivalent of frequency-independent NL analysis over this range, requiring only a Taylor series expansion of the NL time constant.

The models can be further programmed into an equation-based SI analog CAD tool. In this paper, the equation-based models (EBMs) are used to quantitatively analyze SI MDACs. Simulation results show that noise significantly limit the performance of SI MDACs. Optimal performance boundaries are derived for single-ended and fully differential SI MDACs. The boundaries from EBMs are consistent with the published SI circuit measurements. A methodology is formulated to design efficient SI MDACs. The EBM and the design methodology are further verified by designs of two sample SI MDACs in an AMS 0.35-mum CMOS process with SPICE simulation. Results from the EBM match those from real circuit models well, except for the noise of SI MDACs with feedback, in which case, the design margin should be added to the target performance. For low-/medium-resolution (<12 bit) applications, a pipeline ADC with a simple SI MDAC is the most efficient. Nonetheless, single-ended SI ADCs are susceptible to source noise. For high-resolution applications, only fully differential SI pipeline ADCs can be selected.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"31 October 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4663651/","volume":"56","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/4663651/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10573871","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","dateOfInsertion":"10 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Modeling, Quantitative Analysis, and Design of Switched-Current Pipeline A/D Converters","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modeling, Quantitative Analysis, and Design of Switched-Current Pipeline A/D Converters","sourcePdf":"tcsi-yuan-2003379.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.120176S","chronDate":"April  2009","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"4813280","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"4813280","articleId":"4663651","onlineDate":"31 October 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4663663,"authors":[{"name":"Martin J.

It is particularly suitable for the parallel solution of ODEs with multiple time scales and has successfully been used for the solution of electronic circuits and for solving partial differential equations. The main issue limiting the utility of WR is the class of problems with strong subsystem-to-subsystem couplings and long analysis time intervals resulting in nonuniform slow convergence. Here, we consider transmission-line (TL) circuits since they represent an important part of a Spice-type circuit solver. For TLs, the coupling between different lines is relatively weak, and thus, partitioning in the transverse direction leads to very fast WR algorithms. However, longitudinal partitioning of TLs is very challenging due to the strong coupling that results. In this paper, we propose an approach with improved convergence properties for strongly coupled longitudinal partitioning of TLs and other similarly strongly coupled circuits.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4663663/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"31 October 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2009","volume":"56","issue":"8","publicationDate":"Aug. 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"28 August 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4663663/","accessionNumber":"10890331","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Optimized Waveform Relaxation Methods for Longitudinal Partitioning of Transmission Lines","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimized Waveform Relaxation Methods for Longitudinal Partitioning of Transmission Lines","sourcePdf":"tcsi-ruehli-2008286.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.072483S","chronDate":"Aug.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"5200688","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"31","xplore-issue":"5200688","articleId":"4663663","onlineDate":"31 October 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-02"},{"_id":4663664,"authors":[{"name":"Caroline Lelandais-Perrault","affiliation":["Department of Signal Processing and Electronic Systems, \u00c9cole Sup\u00e9rieure d''\u00c9lectricit\u00e9, Gif-sur-Yvette, France"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8919/5200688/4663664/4663664-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Caroline Lelandais-Perrault (M'07) received the Engineer Diploma degree in energy and information science from the \u00c9cole Sup\u00e9rieure d'\u00c9lectricit\u00e9 (SUPELEC), Gif-Sur-Yvette, France, in 1995 and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from Paris XI University, Orsay, France, in 2006.","She worked for six years as a Development Engineer and Project Manager with IN-SNEC company (Zodiac group), a leader in telemetry equipment for satellites and the Ariane launcher.

In order to achieve this and to overcome technological limitations, the A/D conversion systems should be versatile, i.e., it should be possible to adapt the conversion characteristics (resolution and bandwidth) by software. This work studies and adapts hybrid filter banks (HFBs) in this context. First, HFBs, which can provide a large conversion bandwidth, are extended to bandpass sampling, thus minimizing the sampling frequency. Then, we provide efficient ways of improving the HFB resolution in a smaller frequency band, only by reprogramming the digital part. Moreover, this paper takes into account the main drawback of HFBs which is their very high sensitivity to analog imperfections.

The scheme uses simple sample-and-hold circuits controlled by the multiphase clocks to sample a common reference input. Phase spacing is measured by counting the number of zero crossings between two adjacent sampling sequences. A zero-crossing detection scheme is proposed. It has better immunity against the offsets of the comparators used in the detector. A digital calibration processor is also proposed.

Conventional techniques based on crosstalk cancellation are not suitable for FEXT due to the fact that the disturbing source of FEXT is generally unknown to the victims. This paper presents two different approaches to efficiently deal with FEXT over unshielded twisted-pair (UTP) copper cables. To eliminate the error propagation problem in practice, both approaches use the Tomlinson-Harashima precoding (THP) technique which however makes the transceiver design nontrivial. In the first approach, FEXT is treated as noise and a new feedforward FEXT canceller is proposed. Compared with conventional techniques, the proposed FEXT canceller can mitigate the non-causal part of FEXT, thus leading to better FEXT cancellation performance. In the second approach, FEXT is treated as signal, and the general multi-input multi-output (MIMO) equalization technique is combined with the TH precoding technique to deal with both intersymbol interference (ISI) and FEXT. Different from the existing works, the proposed designs comply with the 10GBASE-T standard and they are suitable in real applications. Simulation results verify that the proposed approaches can achieve much better performance in terms of decision-point signal-to-noise ratio (DP-SNR) than conventional techniques. It is also shown that the hardware complexity of the transceiver can be reduced by about 37.2% by utilizing the increased DP-SNR in the proposed designs.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Novel FEXT Cancellation and Equalization for High Speed Ethernet Transmission","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","doi":"10.1109/TCSI.2008.2008479","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","pdfPath":"/iel5/8919/5089871/04663668.pdf","startPage":"1272","endPage":"1285","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSI.2008.2008479","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5089871","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4663668","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4663668/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"31 October 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2009","displayDocTitle":"Novel FEXT Cancellation and Equalization for High Speed Ethernet Transmission","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"56","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/4663668/","dateOfInsertion":"19 June 2009","publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10729833","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Novel FEXT Cancellation and Equalization for High Speed Ethernet Transmission","sourcePdf":"56tcsi06-jchen-2008479.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.097408S","chronDate":"June  2009","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"5089871","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"5089871","articleId":"4663668","onlineDate":"31 October 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4663670,"authors":[{"name":"Prosenjit Mal","affiliation":["Microprocessor Research and Development, Intel Corporation, Hillsboro, OR, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8919/5089871/4663670/4663670-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Prosenjit Mal (S'01\u2013M'05) received the Bachelor's degree in instrumentation and electronics engineering from Jadavpur University, Kolkata, India, in 1993, the Master's degree in electrical engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Delhi, India, in 1995, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical an computer engineering from the University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, OH, in 2004.","Between 1996 and 1999, he worked on modern instrumentation and computer control systems in the research & development center of a leading consulting company in India.

However, one limitation of current FPGAs is that the user is limited to strictly electronic designs. Thus, they are not suitable for applications that are not purely electronic, such as optical communications, photonic information processing systems and other multi-technology applications. While a wide variety of multi-technology devices ranging from microelectromagnetic systems (MEMS) devices, analog devices, photonic information processing devices, telecommunication and digital data processing systems to biological and chemical sensors have been implemented, research in this area has for the most part been limited to systems built with application-specific devices. While these designs are well optimized for a specific application, they do not provide the flexibility associated with reconfigurable/programmable hardware. As with any application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC), this approach is very costly, and the turnaround time between design iterations may be several months. The difficulty of using custom designed multi-technology VLSI components is overcome in the present research with the introduction of a multi-technology FPGA (MT-FPGA) with innovative system architecture. The proposed new class of field programmable device will extend the flexibility, rapid prototyping and reusability benefits associated with conventional FPGA technology into photonic and other multi-technology domain and give rise to the development of a wider class of programmable and embedded integrated systems.","doi":"10.1109/TCSI.2008.2008481","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSI.2008.2008481","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","pdfPath":"/iel5/8919/5089871/04663670.pdf","startPage":"1182","endPage":"1191","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5089871","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4663670/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"31 October 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2009","displayDocTitle":"Design and Demonstration of a Fully Integrated Multi-Technology FPGA: A Reconfigurable Architecture for Photonic and Other Multi-Technology Applications","volume":"56","issue":"6","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"10729834","htmlLink":"/document/4663670/","dateOfInsertion":"19 June 2009","publicationDate":"June 2009","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design and Demonstration of a Fully Integrated Multi-Technology FPGA: A Reconfigurable Architecture for Photonic and Other Multi-Technology Applications","sourcePdf":"56tcsi06-pmal-2008481.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.068088S","chronDate":"June  2009","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"5089871","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"5089871","articleId":"4663670","onlineDate":"31 October 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4663671,"authors":[{"name":"Baoyong Zhang","affiliation":["School of Automation, Nanjing University of Science and Technology of PLA, Nanjing, Jiangsu, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8919/5089871/4663671/4663671-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Baoyong Zhang was born in Shandong Province, China, in 1981.

However, accurate Monte Carlo analysis results are difficult to obtain if the behavioral model is not accurate enough. Therefore, this paper proposes to use an efficient bottom-up approach to generate accurate process-variation-aware behavioral models of CPPLL circuits. Without blind regressions, only one input pattern in the extraction mode sufficiently obtains all required parameters in the behavioral model. A quasi-SA approach is also proposed to accurately reflect process variation effects. Considering generic circuit behaviors, the quasi-SA approach saves considerable simulation time for complicated curve fitting but still keeps estimation accuracy. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed bottom-up modeling flow and quasi-SA equations provide similar accuracy as in the RSM approach, using less extraction cost as in the traditional sensitivity analysis approach.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Statistical analysis","Phase locked loops","Equations","Circuit simulation","Circuit optimization","Analog circuits","Monte Carlo methods","Digital circuits","Timing","Delay"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["circuit simulation","Monte Carlo methods","phase locked loops","sensitivity analysis","statistical analysis","voltage-controlled oscillators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["statistical analysis","PLL behavioral models","Monte Carlo simulation","bottom-up approach","process-variation-aware behavioral models","phase-locked loop circuits","sensitivity analysis"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Behavioral model","Monte Carlo simulation","process variation","quasi-SA"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TCSI.2008.2008502","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","pdfPath":"/iel5/8919/5089871/04663673.pdf","startPage":"1160","endPage":"1172","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5089871","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSI.2008.2008502","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fast Statistical Analysis of Process Variation Effects Using Accurate PLL Behavioral Models","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4663673","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Fast Statistical Analysis of Process Variation Effects Using Accurate PLL Behavioral Models","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4663673/","volume":"56","issue":"6","publicationDate":"June 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4663673/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"10729844","dateOfInsertion":"19 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"31 October 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fast Statistical Analysis of Process Variation Effects Using Accurate PLL Behavioral Models","sourcePdf":"56tcsi06-cliu-2008502.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.12303S","chronDate":"June  2009","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"5089871","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"5089871","articleId":"4663673","onlineDate":"31 October 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4663678,"authors":[{"name":"Dimitrios M.

Designs for elliptic curve cryptography point multiplication are area demanding and time consuming. Thus, the efficient realization of point multiplication is of fundamental importance for the performance of an elliptic curve system. In this paper, a hardware architecture of an elliptic curve point multiplier is proposed that exploits the intrinsic parallelism of the residue number system (RNS), in order to speed up the elliptic curve point calculations and minimize the area complexity of the elliptic curve point multiplier. The architecture proves to be the fastest among all known design approaches, while complexity is less than half of that of previous efforts. This architecture also supports the required input (binary-to-RNS) and output (RNS-to-binary) conversions. Through a graph-oriented approach, the area of the elliptic curve point multiplier is minimized, by optimizing the point addition and doubling algorithms. Also, through this approach, the number of execution steps for point addition is matched to the number of execution steps for point doubling. Additionally, the impact of various RNS bases, in terms of number of moduli and their bit lengths, on the area and speed of the proposed implementation is analyzed, in an effort to define the potential for using RNS in elliptic curve cryptography.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Elliptic curves","Elliptic curve cryptography","Arithmetic","Galois fields","Hardware","Public key cryptography","Mathematics","Security","Signal processing algorithms","Algorithm design and analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiplying circuits","parallel architectures","public key cryptography","residue number systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["RNS implementation","elliptic curve cryptography","hardware architecture","intrinsic parallelism","residue number system","binary-to-RNS conversion","RNS-to-binary conversion","input conversion","output conversion","Fp elliptic curve point multiplier","graph-oriented approach","point addition algorithms","point doubling algorithms","prime fields"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Computer arithmetic","elliptic curve cryptography (ECC)","finite field arithmetic","residue number system (RNS)"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4663678","doi":"10.1109/TCSI.2008.2008507","startPage":"1202","endPage":"1213","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","pdfPath":"/iel5/8919/5089871/04663678.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5089871","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSI.2008.2008507","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"31 October 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4663678/","displayDocTitle":"An RNS Implementation of an <formula formulatype=\"inline\"> <tex Notation=\"TeX\">$F_{p}$</tex></formula> Elliptic Curve Point Multiplier","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2009","volume":"56","issue":"6","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","dateOfInsertion":"19 June 2009","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"10729837","htmlLink":"/document/4663678/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An RNS Implementation of an <formula formulatype=\"inline\"> <tex Notation=\"TeX\">$F_{p}$</tex></formula> Elliptic Curve Point Multiplier","sourcePdf":"56tcsi06-dschinianakis-2008507.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.126164S","chronDate":"June  2009","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"5089871","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"70","xplore-issue":"5089871","articleId":"4663678","onlineDate":"31 October 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4663680,"authors":[{"name":"Jes\u00das Ruiz-Amaya","affiliation":["Institute of Microeletronics of Seville IMSE CNM, University of Sevilla, Seville, Spain"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8919/5089871/4663680/4663680-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jes\u00fas Ruiz-Amaya was born in Seville, Spain, in 1979.

One distinctive feature of the proposal is the computation of the impact of signal levels (on both the model parameters and the model structure) as they change during transient evolution. This is achieved by using an event-driven behavioral approach that combines small- and large-signal behavioral descriptions and keeps track of the amplifier state after each clock phase. Also, SC circuits are modeled under closed-loop conditions to guarantee that the results remain close to those obtained by electrical simulation of the actual circuits. Based on these models, which can be regarded as intermediate between the more established small-signal approach and full-fledged simulations, design procedures for dimensioning SC building blocks are presented whose targets are system-level specifications (such as ENOB and SNDR) instead of OTA specifications.

Many properties suggested to model transitivity of preferences are inappropriate for reciprocal preference relations. In this paper, a functional equation is put forward to model the ldquocardinal consistency in the strength of preferencesrdquo of reciprocal preference relations. We show that under the assumptions of continuity and monotonicity properties, the set of representable uninorm operators is characterized as the solution to this functional equation. Cardinal consistency with the conjunctive representable cross ratio uninorm is equivalent to Tanino's multiplicative transitivity property. Because any two representable uninorms are order isomorphic, we conclude that multiplicative transitivity is the most appropriate property for modeling cardinal consistency of reciprocal preference relations.

This is true due mainly to the accurate modeling and the finite set of inputs or possible switching combinations. However, when it is used in multilevel converters, the dynamic performance is degraded, because the optimization algorithm needs to evaluate and search over a large number of possible switching combinations. In this paper, a predictive control algorithm, which exhibits high dynamic performance for multilevel converters, is proposed. The algorithm reduces the complexity of calculations and the number of possible combinations, allowing the use of predictive control with a large number of switching states. Experimental results on a 27-level asymmetric multicell converter, which validate the proposed algorithm, are presented.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4663708/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"31 October 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"55","issue":"12","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"02 December 2008","accessionNumber":"10348748","htmlLink":"/document/4663708/","displayDocTitle":"Predictive Control Algorithm Technique for Multilevel Asymmetric Cascaded H-Bridge Inverters","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Predictive Control Algorithm Technique for Multilevel Asymmetric Cascaded H-Bridge Inverters","sourcePdf":"tie-perez-2006948.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.070083S","chronDate":"Dec.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"4681672","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"126","xplore-issue":"4681672","articleId":"4663708","onlineDate":"31 October 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4663709,"authors":[{"name":"Brice Beltran","affiliation":["Laboratoire Brestois de M\u00e9canique et des Syst\u00e8mes, University of Brest, Brest, France"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/5200775/4663709/4663709-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Brice Beltran was born in Arles, France, in 1981.

This control strategy presents attractive features such as robustness to parametric uncertainties of the turbine. The proposed sliding-mode control approach has been validated on a 1.5-MW three-blade wind turbine using the national renewable energy laboratory wind turbine simulator FAST (Fatigue, Aerodynamics, Structures, and Turbulence) code. Validation results show that the proposed control strategy is effective in terms of power regulation. Moreover, the sliding-mode approach is arranged so as to produce no chattering in the generated torque that could lead to increased mechanical stress because of strong torque variations.","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2008.2006949","startPage":"3314","endPage":"3321","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2008.2006949","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5200775","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/41/5200775/04663709.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High-Order Sliding-Mode Control of Variable-Speed Wind Turbines","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4663709/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"High-Order Sliding-Mode Control of Variable-Speed Wind Turbines","volume":"56","issue":"9","htmlLink":"/document/4663709/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10816620","publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"11 August 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"31 October 2008","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High-Order Sliding-Mode Control of Variable-Speed Wind Turbines","sourcePdf":"tie-benbouzid-2006949.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.083881S","chronDate":"Sept.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"5200775","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"266","xplore-issue":"5200775","articleId":"4663709","onlineDate":"31 October 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4663711,"authors":[{"name":"Jiabing Hu","affiliation":["College of Electrical Engineering, University of Zhejiang, Hangzhou, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/4771829/4663711/4663711-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jiabing Hu (S'05) was born in Luan, China.

Coordinated control of the grid- and rotor-side converters (GSC and RSC, respectively) during voltage unbalance is proposed. Under an unbalanced supply voltage, the RSC is controlled to eliminate the torque pulsation at double supply frequency. The oscillation of the stator output active power is then compensated by the active power output from the GSC, to ensure constant active power output from the overall DFIG generation system. In order to provide precise control of the positive- and negative-sequence currents of the GSC and RSC, a current control scheme consisting of a proportional integral (PI) controller and a resonant (R) compensator is presented. The PI plus R current regulator is implemented in the positive synchronous reference frame without the need to decompose the positive- and negative-sequence components. Simulations on a 1.5-MW DFIG system and experimental tests on a 1.5-kW prototype validate the proposed strategy. Precise control of both positive- and negative-sequence currents and simultaneous elimination of torque and total active power oscillations have been achieved.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2008.2006952","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4771829","startPage":"439","endPage":"451","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/41/4771829/04663711.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improved Control of DFIG Systems During Network Unbalance Using PI\u2013R Current Regulators","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4663711/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"31 October 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4663711/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Improved Control of DFIG Systems During Network Unbalance Using PI\u2013R Current Regulators","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2009","accessionNumber":"10429184","dateOfInsertion":"02 February 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"56","issue":"2","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improved Control of DFIG Systems During Network Unbalance Using PI\u2013R Current Regulators","sourcePdf":"tie-hu-2006952.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.066501S","chronDate":"Feb.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"4771829","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"324","xplore-issue":"4771829","articleId":"4663711","onlineDate":"31 October 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-08"},{"_id":4663712,"authors":[{"name":"Cristian Lascu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Biomedical Engineering, University of Nevada, Reno, NV, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/4771829/4663712/4663712-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Cristian Lascu received the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from the University Politehnica of Timisoara, Timisoara, Romania, in 1995 and 2002, respectively.","Since 1995, he has been with the Faculty of Electrical Engineering, University Politehnica of Timisoara, where his research has focused on power electronics and high-performance electrical drives.

All controllers under scrutiny perform the harmonic compensation by using arrays of resonant controllers, one for the fundamental and one for each harmonic of interest, in order to achieve zero phase shift and unity gain in the closed-loop transfer function for selected harmonics. The complete current controller is the superposition of all individual harmonic controllers and may be implemented in various reference frames. The analysis is focused on the comparison of harmonic and total closed-loop transfer functions for each controller. Analytical similarities and differences between schemes in terms of frequency response characteristics are emphasized. It is concluded that three of them have identical harmonic behavior despite the fact that their implementation is significantly different. It emerges that the fourth one has superior behavior and robustness and can stably work at higher frequencies than the others. Theoretical findings and analysis are supported by comparative experimental results on a 7-kVA laboratory setup. The highest harmonic frequency that can be stably compensated with each control method has been determined, indicating significant differences in the control performance.","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2008.2006953","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/41/4771829/04663712.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2008.2006953","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4771829","startPage":"337","endPage":"347","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Frequency Response Analysis of Current Controllers for Selective Harmonic Compensation in Active Power Filters","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4663712","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Frequency Response Analysis of Current Controllers for Selective Harmonic Compensation in Active Power Filters","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4663712/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"31 October 2008","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"56","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Feb. 2009","accessionNumber":"10429180","dateOfInsertion":"02 February 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4663712/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Frequency Response Analysis of Current Controllers for Selective Harmonic Compensation in Active Power Filters","sourcePdf":"tie-lascu-2006953.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.059649S","chronDate":"Feb.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"4771829","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"242","xplore-issue":"4771829","articleId":"4663712","onlineDate":"31 October 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4663714,"authors":[{"name":"Alberto Bellini","affiliation":["Department of Engineering Sciences and Methods, University of Modena and Reggio Emilia and INFM, Reggio Emilia, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/4681672/4663714/4663714-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Alberto Bellini (S'96\u2013A'98\u2013M'03) was born in Italy in 1969.

However, MCSA is still an open research topic, as some signatures may be created by different phenomena, wherein it may become sensitive to load and inertia variations, and with respect to an oscillating load torque, although suitable data normalization can be applied. Recently, the topic of diagnostic techniques for drives and low to medium size machines is becoming attractive, as the procedure can be embedded in the drive at no additional thanks to a dedicated firmware, provided that a suitable computational cost is available. In this paper, statistical time-domain techniques are used to track grid frequency and machine slip. In this way, either a lower computational cost or a higher accuracy than traditional discrete Fourier transform techniques can be obtained.

At very low speeds, the angular position of the rotor can be estimated by injecting test voltage signals (TVSs) to detect the spatial orientations of existing position-dependent rotor anisotropies. The TVS produces transient stator current changes, so that stator current derivatives can be estimated in a digital way. In a SynRM, the stator current derivatives contain useful information that can be used to estimate the angular position of the rotor. The obtained information is processed by means of a quadrature phase-locked loop observer to extract the angular position of the rotor without detriments in phase and frequency. Following this strategy, no extra hardware, special current transducers, or connections are needed in comparison with a standard drive with an encoder. Based on the proposed strategy, an encoderless PDTC scheme for SynRMs is implemented. Experimental results using a digital signal processor and a field-programmable gate array embedded in the same board verify the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme.","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2008.2007025","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2008.2007025","startPage":"4408","endPage":"4416","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/41/4681672/04663720.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4681672","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Encoderless Predictive Direct Torque Control for Synchronous Reluctance Machines at Very Low and Zero Speed","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"31 October 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2008","displayDocTitle":"Encoderless Predictive Direct Torque Control for Synchronous Reluctance Machines at Very Low and Zero Speed","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"02 December 2008","volume":"55","issue":"12","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4663720/","accessionNumber":"10348763","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4663720/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Encoderless Predictive Direct Torque Control for Synchronous Reluctance Machines at Very Low and Zero Speed","sourcePdf":"tie-moralescaporal-2007025.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.123871S","chronDate":"Dec.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"4681672","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"69","xplore-issue":"4681672","articleId":"4663720","onlineDate":"31 October 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4663721,"authors":[{"name":"Tobias Geyer","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Auckland, Auckland, New Zealand"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/5062301/4663721/4663721-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Tobias Geyer (M'08) received the Dipl.-Ing. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (ETH) Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland, in 2000 and 2005, respectively.","From 2006 to 2008, he was with General Electric's Global Research Center, Munich, Germany, where he was a Project Leader working on control and modulation schemes for large electrical drives.

Then, the dynamics of the LUSM mechanism with the introduction of a lumped uncertainty, which include the friction force, are derived. Since the dynamic characteristics and motor parameters of the LUSM are nonlinear and time varying, a computed force control system using ENN is designed to improve the control performance for the tracking of various reference trajectories. The ENN with both online learning and excellent approximation capabilities is employed to estimate a nonlinear function including the lumped uncertainty of the moving table mechanism. Moreover, the Lyapunov stability theorem and the projection algorithm are adopted to ensure the stability of the control system and the convergence of the ENN. Furthermore, an FPGA chip is adopted to implement the developed control algorithm for possible low-cost and high-performance industrial applications.

To minimize the downtime caused by migrating large disk storage data and keep data integrity and consistency, we propose a three-phase migration (TPM) algorithm. To facilitate the migration back to initial source machine, we use an incremental migration (IM) algorithm to reduce the amount of the data to be migrated. Block-bitmap is used to track all the write accesses to the local disk storage during the migration. Synchronization of the local disk storage in the migration is performed according to the block-bitmap. Experiments show that our algorithms work well even when I/O-intensive workloads are running in the migrated VM. The downtime of the migration is around 100 milliseconds, close to shared-storage migration. Total migration time is greatly reduced using IM. The block-bitmap based synchronization mechanism is simple and effective. Performance overhead of recording all the writes on migrated VM is very low.","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Cluster Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Cluster Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4655410/4663724/04663760.pdf","startPage":"99","endPage":"106","doi":"10.1109/CLUSTR.2008.4663760","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CLUSTR.2008.4663760","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4663724","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Live and incremental whole-system migration of virtual machines using block-bitmap","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4663760/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 29 2008-Oct. 1 2008","displayDocTitle":"Live and incremental whole-system migration of virtual machines using block-bitmap","htmlLink":"/document/4663760/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"31 October 2008","accessionNumber":"10387748","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"29 Sept.-1 Oct. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Live and incremental whole-system migration of virtual machines using block-bitmap","confLoc":"Tsukuba","sourcePdf":"SPI-10242008-00034.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.0678S","chronDate":"Sept. 29 2008-Oct. 1 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4655410","isNumber":"4663724","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4655410","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"4663724","articleId":"4663760","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":4663765,"authors":[{"name":"Josep M.

Power electronics researchers try to apply new electronic controller solutions with the capacity of implementing new and more complex control algorithms combined with internal high-speed communication interfaces. Thus, it is possible to monitor, store, and transfer a large number of internal variables that can be sent online to local or remote hosts in order to take new set points of different generation units. With this objective, this paper presents the design, implementation, and test of an industrial multiprocessor controller based on a floating-point digital signal processor (DSP) and a field-programmable gate array, which operate cooperatively. The communication architecture, which has been added to the proposed electronic solution, consists of a universal serial bus (USB), implemented with a minimum use of the DSP core, and a controller area network (CAN) bus that permits distributed control. Although the proposed system can be readily applied to any DPGS, in this paper, it is focused on a 150-kVA back-to-back three-level neutral-point-clamped voltage source converter for wind turbine applications.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4663812/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"31 October 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","publicationDate":"March 2009","accessionNumber":"10500865","htmlLink":"/document/4663812/","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"27 February 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"56","issue":"3","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A DSP- and FPGA-Based Industrial Control With High-Speed Communication Interfaces for Grid Converters Applied to Distributed Power Generation Systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A DSP- and FPGA-Based Industrial Control With High-Speed Communication Interfaces for Grid Converters Applied to Distributed Power Generation Systems","sourcePdf":"tie-bueno-2007043.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.115668S","chronDate":"March  2009","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"4796879","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"93","xplore-issue":"4796879","articleId":"4663812","onlineDate":"31 October 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4663815,"authors":[{"name":"Eudemario Souza de Santana","affiliation":["Federal Center of Technology Education, Camacari, Bahia, Brazil"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/4681672/4663815/4663815-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Eudemario Souza de Santana received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering from the Federal University of Bahia, Salvador, Bahia, Brazil, in 2000, and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees from the State University of Campinas, Campinas, S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil, in 2002 and 2006, respectively.","Since 2008, he has been a Researcher with the Federal Center of Technology Education, Cama\u00e7ari, Bahia.

A state-space approach is employed for modeling a rotor-flux-oriented IM. The control law is derived by optimization of an objective function that considers the control effort and the difference between the predicted outputs (speed and rotor flux) and the specific references, with predicted outputs calculated using a linearized state-space model. The rotor flux and speed are estimated by using an extended Kalman filter. In this model, the load inertia is unknown, and the external load torque is considered to be a disturbance. Its amplitude is computed with the electromechanical equation or estimated by the Kalman filter. Simulated and experimental results show the good performance of this strategy.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/41/4681672/04663815.pdf","startPage":"4398","endPage":"4407","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2008.2007376","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2008.2007376","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4681672","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Predictive Algorithm for Controlling Speed and Rotor Flux of Induction Motor","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4663815/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"31 October 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2008","displayDocTitle":"A Predictive Algorithm for Controlling Speed and Rotor Flux of Induction Motor","htmlLink":"/document/4663815/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"02 December 2008","accessionNumber":"10348755","isJournal":true,"volume":"55","issue":"12","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Predictive Algorithm for Controlling Speed and Rotor Flux of Induction Motor","sourcePdf":"tie-bim-2007376.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.076635S","chronDate":"Dec.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"4681672","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"81","xplore-issue":"4681672","articleId":"4663815","onlineDate":"31 October 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4663816,"authors":[{"name":"Patricio Cortes","affiliation":["Electronics Engineering Department, Universidad T\u00e8cnica Federico Santa Mar\u00eda, Valparaiso, Chile"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/4681672/4663816/4663816-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Patricio Cort\u00e9s (S'05\u2013M'08) received the Engineer and M.Sc. degrees in electronic engineering, in 2004, and the Ph.D. degree, in 2008, from the Universidad T\u00e9cnica Federico Santa Maria (UTFSM), Valparaiso, Chile.","Since 2003, he has been with the Electronics Engineering Department, UTFSM, where he is currently a Research Associate.

Predictive controller selects in every sampling period appropriate voltage vector sequence and calculates duty cycles in order to minimize instantaneous active and reactive power errors. The theoretical principles of this algorithm are discussed, and selected experimental measurements and scope graphs that illustrate the operation and performance of the system are presented. It is shown that VF-P-DPC algorithm exhibits several advantages, particularly sinusoidal-grid-current low harmonic distortion even when grid voltage is distorted.

FC converters do not need complex transformers to obtain the DC-link voltage and also present good robustness properties, when operating under internal fault conditions. Unfortunately, with standard modulation strategies, to increase the number of output voltage levels of FC converters, it is necessary to increase the number of cells and, hence, the number of capacitors and switches. In this paper, we develop a finite-state model predictive control strategy for FC converters. Our method controls output currents and voltages and also the FC voltage ratios. This allows one to increase the number of output voltage levels, even at high power factor load conditions and without having to increase the number of capacitors and switches. Experimental results illustrate that the proposed algorithm is capable of achieving good performance, despite possible parameter mismatch.","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2008.2007545","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/41/5062301/04663824.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2008.2007545","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5062301","startPage":"1839","endPage":"1846","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Model Predictive Control of an Asymmetric Flying Capacitor Converter","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4663824","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Model Predictive Control of an Asymmetric Flying Capacitor Converter","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4663824/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"31 October 2008","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"56","issue":"6","publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10713187","dateOfInsertion":"02 June 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4663824/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Model Predictive Control of an Asymmetric Flying Capacitor Converter","sourcePdf":"tie-lezana-2007545.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.064143S","chronDate":"June  2009","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"5062301","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"160","xplore-issue":"5062301","articleId":"4663824","onlineDate":"31 October 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4663825,"authors":[{"name":"Saverio Bolognani","affiliation":["Department of Technique and Management of Industrial Systems, University of Padova, Vicenza, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/5062301/4663825/4663825-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Saverio Bolognani (S'04) received the B.S. degree (summa cum laude) in information engineering and the M.S. degree (summa cum laude) in automation engineering from the University of Padova, Padova, Italy, in 2005 and 2007, respectively.

Finally, simulation and experimental results confirm that the current ripple of the proposed modulation strategy is lower than that of traditional SVM strategies and, in some cases, with a reduced number of commutations.","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2008.2007557","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/41/4771829/04663831.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4771829","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2008.2007557","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","startPage":"326","endPage":"336","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal Use of Zero Vectors for Minimizing the Output Current Distortion in Matrix Converters","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4663831","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"31 October 2008","displayDocTitle":"Optimal Use of Zero Vectors for Minimizing the Output Current Distortion in Matrix Converters","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4663831/","volume":"56","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/4663831/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2009","accessionNumber":"10429182","dateOfInsertion":"02 February 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal Use of Zero Vectors for Minimizing the Output Current Distortion in Matrix Converters","sourcePdf":"tie-zarri-2007557.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.081497S","chronDate":"Feb.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"4771829","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"81","xplore-issue":"4771829","articleId":"4663831","onlineDate":"31 October 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":4663833,"authors":[{"name":"Michael H.

Moreover, the amount of active and reactive powers can be arbitrarily chosen within certain limits. These limits as well as the degree of harmonic attenuation is determined by the line-side filter. This paper basically focuses on the current control of active rectifiers incorporating a line-side filter of first- up to third-order degree.

This paper reveals the relationship between input voltage sharing (IVS) and output current sharing of the constituent modules of the ISOP converter. A novel IVS control strategy, which is decoupled with the output voltage regulation, is proposed. This control allows IVS and output voltage regulation to be designed independently. An ISOP converter, which uses the phase-shifted full-bridge (PS-FB) converter as the basic module, is considered. Based on the proposed control strategy, this ISOP converter together with the control circuit can be decoupled from several independent single-input and single-output systems. An ISOP converter consisting of three PS-FB modules is used to illustrate the design procedure, and a 3-kW experimental prototype is fabricated and tested.","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2008.2007980","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/41/4808369/04663834.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2008.2007980","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4808369","startPage":"1174","endPage":"1185","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Control Strategy for Input-Series\u2013Output-Parallel Converters","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4663834","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Control Strategy for Input-Series\u2013Output-Parallel Converters","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4663834/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"31 October 2008","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"56","issue":"4","publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10557981","dateOfInsertion":"31 March 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4663834/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Control Strategy for Input-Series\u2013Output-Parallel Converters","sourcePdf":"tie-ruan-2007980.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.12207S","chronDate":"April  2009","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"4808369","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"147","xplore-issue":"4808369","articleId":"4663834","onlineDate":"31 October 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-30"},{"_id":4663838,"authors":[{"name":"Carlos Andr\u00c9s Ramos-Paja","affiliation":["Departamento d'Enginyeria Electr\u00f2nica, El\u00e8ctrica i Autom\u00e0tica, Escola T\u00e8cnica Superior d'Enginyeria, Universitat Rovira i Virgili, Tarragona, Spain"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/4796879/4663838/4663838-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Carlos Andr\u00e9s Ramos-Paja (S'08) received (with honors) the Ingeniera Electr\u00f3nica and Master en Ingenier\u00eda Autom\u00e1tica degrees from the Universidad del Valle, Cali, Colombia, in 2002 and in 2005, respectively.

The power system consists of a hybrid fuel cell/capacitor topology, and the control objective is to follow the minimum fuel consumption points for a given load power profile. This is done by controlling the air pump voltage and regulating the fuel cell current through a DC/DC switching converter. Moreover, the design and control parameters of the output DC bus are discussed, and the calculations are adjusted to a Ballard 1.2-kW Nexa power module. Finally, the control results, fuel consumption, and fuel cell protection against oxygen starvation phenomenon are analyzed and experimentally validated, contrasting its performance with the Nexa power module internal control system.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"31 October 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4663838/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2009","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"56","issue":"3","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 2009","dateOfInsertion":"27 February 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4663838/","accessionNumber":"10500862","displayDocTitle":"Minimum Fuel Consumption Strategy for PEM Fuel Cells","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Minimum Fuel Consumption Strategy for PEM Fuel Cells","sourcePdf":"tie-ramospaja-2007993.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.076455S","chronDate":"March  2009","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"4796879","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"94","xplore-issue":"4796879","articleId":"4663838","onlineDate":"31 October 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4663843,"authors":[{"name":"Chin Sien Moo","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Sun Yat-Sen University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/4808369/4663843/4663843-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Chin Sien Moo (M'98) was born in Pingdong, Taiwan, in 1953.

Overnight sleep studies were conducted on 40 healthy subjects during a clinical trial at the University of Virginia. The NAPS system's measures of heart rate and breathing rate were compared to ECG, pulse oximetry, and respiratory inductance plethysmography (RIP). The subjects were split into a training dataset and a validation dataset, maintaining similar demographics in each set. The NAPS system accurately detected heart rate, averaged over the prescribed 30-s epochs, to within less than 2.72 beats per minute of ECG, and accurately detected breathing rate, averaged over the same epochs, to within 2.10 breaths per minute of RIP bands used in polysomnography.","doi":"10.1109/TITB.2008.2007194","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Technology in Biomedicine","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Technology in Biomedicine","pdfPath":"/iel5/4233/4740174/04663856.pdf","startPage":"111","endPage":"120","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TITB.2008.2007194","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4740174","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Development and Preliminary Validation of Heart Rate and Breathing Rate Detection Using a Passive, Ballistocardiography-Based Sleep Monitoring System","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4663856/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"31 October 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2009","displayDocTitle":"Development and Preliminary Validation of Heart Rate and Breathing Rate Detection Using a Passive, Ballistocardiography-Based Sleep Monitoring System","volume":"13","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2009","accessionNumber":"10370416","pubMedId":"19129030","htmlLink":"/document/4663856/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Development and Preliminary Validation of Heart Rate and Breathing Rate Detection Using a Passive, Ballistocardiography-Based Sleep Monitoring System","sourcePdf":"titb-mack-2007194.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.079975S","chronDate":"Jan.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"4233","isNumber":"4740174","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4233","citationCount":"128","xplore-issue":"4740174","articleId":"4663856","onlineDate":"31 October 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4663858,"authors":[{"name":"Gouenou Coatrieux","affiliation":["Institut T\u00e9l\u00e9com, T\u00e9l\u00e9com Bretagne Toulouse, Brest, France","Institut National de la Sant\u00e9 Et de la Recherche M\u00e9dicale, Brest, France"],"bio":{"p":["Gouenou Coatrieux (M'06) received the Ph.D. degree in signal processing and telecommunication from the University of Rennes I, Rennes, France, in collaboration with the Ecole Nationale Sup\u00e9rieure des T\u00e9l\u00e9communications, Paris, France, in 2002.","His Ph.D. focused on watermarking in medical imaging.

It summarizes the symbolic descriptions of the image, the symbolic descriptions of the findings semiology, and the similarity rules that contribute to balancing the importance of previous descriptors when comparing images. Instead of modifying the image file format by adding some extra header information, watermarking is used to embed the KD in the pixel gray-level values of the corresponding images. When shared through open networks, watermarking also helps to convey reliability proofs (integrity and authenticity) of an image and its KD.

In this paper, a novel strategy called oriented active shape models (OASM) is presented in an attempt to overcome the following five limitations of ASM: 1) lower delineation accuracy, 2) the requirement of a large number of landmarks, 3) sensitivity to search range, 4) sensitivity to initialization, and 5) inability to fully exploit the specific information present in the given image to be segmented. OASM effectively combines the rich statistical shape information embodied in ASM with the boundary orientedness property and the globally optimal delineation capability of the live wire methodology of boundary segmentation. The latter characteristics allow live wire to effectively separate an object boundary from other nonobject boundaries with similar properties especially when they come very close in the image domain. The approach leads to a two-level dynamic programming method, wherein the first level corresponds to boundary recognition and the second level corresponds to boundary delineation, and to an effective automatic initialization method. The method outputs a globally optimal boundary that agrees with the shape model if the recognition step is successful in bringing the model close to the boundary in the image. Extensive evaluation experiments have been conducted by utilizing 40 image (magnetic resonance and computed tomography) data sets in each of five different application areas for segmenting breast, liver, bones of the foot, and cervical vertebrae of the spine. Comparisons are made between OASM and ASM based on precision, accuracy, and efficiency of segmentation. Accuracy is assessed using both region-based false positive and false negative measures and boundary-based distance measures. The results indicate the following: 1) The accuracy of segmentation via OASM is considerably better than that of ASM; 2) The number of landmarks can be reduced by a factor of 3 in OASM over that in ASM; 3) OASM becomes largely independent of search range and initialization becomes automatic. All three benefits of OASM ensue mainly from the severe constraints brought in by the boundary-orientedness property of live wire and the globally optimal solution found by the 2-level dynamic programming algorithm.","doi":"10.1109/TMI.2008.2007820","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","pdfPath":"/iel5/42/4806303/04663864.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMI.2008.2007820","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4806303","startPage":"571","endPage":"584","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Oriented Active Shape Models","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4663864","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Oriented Active Shape Models","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4663864/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"31 October 2008","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"28","issue":"4","publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10557071","pubMedId":"19336277","dateOfInsertion":"27 March 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4663864/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Oriented Active Shape Models","sourcePdf":"tmi-jliu-2007820.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.099529S","chronDate":"April  2009","xplore-pub-id":"42","isNumber":"4806303","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"42","citationCount":"44","xplore-issue":"4806303","articleId":"4663864","onlineDate":"31 October 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4663867,"authors":[{"name":"Jean Provost","affiliation":["Department of Biomedical Engineering, Columbia University, NY, USA","D\u00e9partement de G\u00e9nie Electrique and Institut de G\u00e9nie Biom\u00e9dical, \u00c9cole Polytechnique de Montr\u00e9al, Montreal, QUE, Canada"],"firstName":"Jean","lastName":"Provost","id":"37403598000"},{"name":"Fr\u00c9d\u00c9ric Lesage","affiliation":["D\u00e9partement de G\u00e9nie Electrique and Institut de G\u00e9nie Biom\u00e9dical, \u00c9cole Polytechnique de Montr\u00e9al, Montreal, QUE, Canada"],"firstName":"Fr\u00c9d\u00c9ric","lastName":"Lesage","id":"37294337600"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0278-0062"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-254X"}],"articleNumber":"4663867","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":180,"citationCountPatent":10,"totalDownloads":2907},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society","url":"http://www.embs.org"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.ieee.org/organizations/society/sp/index.html"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Nuclear and Plasma Sciences Society","url":"http://www.ewh.ieee.org/soc/nps/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control Society","url":"http://www.ieee-uffc.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Compressed sensing","Tomography","Optical imaging","High-resolution imaging","Image reconstruction","Animals","Optical sensors","Reconstruction algorithms","Costs","Image coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biomedical optical imaging","bio-optics","medical image processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compressed sensing","photo-acoustic tomography","small animal imaging","optical imaging","radiation tissues","circular tomography","image reconstruction"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Compressed sensing","compressive sampling","curvelets","image reconstruction","photoacoustic imaging","wavelets"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Algorithms","Computer Simulation","Image Processing, Computer-Assisted","Optics and Photonics","Phantoms, Imaging","Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted","Tomography","Transducers","Ultrasonics"]}],"abstract":"Photo-acoustic (PA) imaging has been developed for different purposes, but recently, the modality has gained interest with applications to small animal imaging.

Because of the limited amount of radiation tissues can be exposed to, existing reconstruction algorithms for circular tomography require a great number of measurements and averaging, implying long acquisition times. Time-resolved PA imaging is therefore possible only at the cost of complex and expensive electronics. This paper suggests a new reconstruction strategy using the compressed sensing formalism which states that a small number of linear projections of a compressible image contain enough information for reconstruction. By directly sampling the image to recover in a sparse representation, it is possible to dramatically reduce the number of measurements needed for a given quality of reconstruction.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The Application of Compressed Sensing for Photo-Acoustic Tomography","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","doi":"10.1109/TMI.2008.2007825","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","pdfPath":"/iel5/42/4806303/04663867.pdf","startPage":"585","endPage":"594","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMI.2008.2007825","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4806303","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4663867","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4663867/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"31 October 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2009","displayDocTitle":"The Application of Compressed Sensing for Photo-Acoustic Tomography","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"28","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/4663867/","dateOfInsertion":"27 March 2009","publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10557073","pubMedId":"19272991","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Application of Compressed Sensing for Photo-Acoustic Tomography","sourcePdf":"tmi-jprovost-2007825.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.140903S","chronDate":"April  2009","xplore-pub-id":"42","isNumber":"4806303","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"42","citationCount":"180","xplore-issue":"4806303","articleId":"4663867","onlineDate":"31 October 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-19"},{"_id":4663869,"authors":[{"name":"Nishant Patil","affiliation":["University of Stanford, Stanford, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7729/4757441/4663869/4663869-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Nishant Patil (S\u201903) received the B.S. degree (Hons.) in electrical and computer engineering with a minor in physics from Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA, in 2004 and the M.S. degree in electrical engineering from Stanford University, Stanford, CA, in 2006.

Using a Carbon Nanotube Field Effect Transistor (CNFET) SPICE model, we evaluate circuit-level performance of CNFET technology in the presence of CNT fabrication-related nonidealities and imperfections, and parasitic resistances and capacitances extracted from the CNFET circuit layout. We use Monte Carlo simulations using the CNFET SPICE model to investigate the effects of three major CNT process-related imperfections on circuit-level performance: 1) doping variations in the CNFET source and drain regions; 2) CNT diameter variations; and 3) variations caused by the removal of metallic CNTs. The simulation results indicate that metallic CNT removal has the most impact on CNFET variation; less than 8% of CNTs grown should be metallic to reduce circuit performance variation. This paper also presents an analytical model for the scalability of CNFET technology. High CNT density (250 CNTs/mum) is critical to ensure that performance (delay and energy) gains over silicon CMOS are maintained or improved with shrinking lithographic dimensions.","doi":"10.1109/TNANO.2008.2006903","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nanotechnology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nanotechnology","pdfPath":"/iel5/7729/4757441/04663869.pdf","startPage":"37","endPage":"45","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNANO.2008.2006903","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4757441","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Circuit-Level Performance Benchmarking and Scalability Analysis of Carbon Nanotube Transistor Circuits","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4663869","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"31 October 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4663869/","displayDocTitle":"Circuit-Level Performance Benchmarking and Scalability Analysis of Carbon Nanotube Transistor Circuits","volume":"8","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2009","accessionNumber":"10401538","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4663869/","dateOfInsertion":"20 January 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Circuit-Level Performance Benchmarking and Scalability Analysis of Carbon Nanotube Transistor Circuits","sourcePdf":"tnano-patil-2006903.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.084097S","chronDate":"Jan.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"7729","isNumber":"4757441","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7729","citationCount":"103","xplore-issue":"4757441","articleId":"4663869","onlineDate":"31 October 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4663871,"authors":[{"name":"V.

The proposed local-SOI fabrication provides various nanowire cross sections: Omega-like, pentagonal, triangular, and circular, all controlled by isotropic etching using nitride spacers and silicon sacrificial oxidation. The reported top-down SiNW fabrication offers excellent control of wire doping and placement, as well as ohmic source and drain contacts. A particular feature of the process is the buildup of a tensile strain in all suspended nanowires, attaining values of few percents, reflected in stress values higher than 2-3 GPa. A very high yield (>90%) is obtained in terms of functionality of long-channel SiNW GAA mosfet.

To achieve this, we apply very minor modifications on the way of controlling nanogrids, while the basic manufacturing requirements remain the same. The fabric that is based on the new heterogeneous two-level logic yields higher density for the applications mapped to it. We find that it also improves the efficiency of fault tolerance techniques as it significantly simplifies the designs. In addition, we found that it enables voting at nanoscale that can improve fault tolerance further. A nanoscale processor is implemented for evaluation purposes. We found that compared with an implementation on a Nanoscale Application-Specific IC (NASIC) fabric with one type of two-level logic, the density of this processor improves by up to 52% by using the heterogeneous logic. Furthermore, the yield is improved by 15% at 2% defective transistors and by 147% at 5% defect rates. Detailed analysis on density and yield is provided. The approach is applicable in grid-based fabrics in general, e.g., it can be used in both NASIC and hybrid semiconductor/nanowire/molecular (CMOL) designs.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nanotechnology","pdfPath":"/iel5/7729/4757441/04663872.pdf","startPage":"22","endPage":"30","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nanotechnology","doi":"10.1109/TNANO.2008.2007645","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNANO.2008.2007645","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4757441","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4663872","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Heterogeneous Two-Level Logic and Its Density and Fault Tolerance Implications in Nanoscale Fabrics","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fault tolerance","Fabrics","CMOS logic circuits","Logic devices","Reconfigurable logic","Logic circuits","Programmable logic arrays","Manufacturing","Application specific integrated circuits","Computer architecture"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["application specific integrated circuits","fabrics","fault tolerance","logic gates","molecular electronics","nanoelectronics","nanowires","semiconductor quantum wires"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["heterogeneous two-level logic family","nanoscale fabrics","nanoscale computing","AND-OR","NOR-NOR","NAND-NAND","nanogrids","fault tolerance techniques","Nanoscale Application-Specific IC","NASIC","hybrid semiconductor-nanowire-molecular designs","CMOL"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["hybrid semiconductor/nanowire/molecular (CMOL)","nanoelectronics","nanofabrics","Nanoscale Application-Specific IC (NASIC)","nanoscale processors","semiconductor nanowires (NWs)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4663872/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"31 October 2008","displayDocTitle":"Heterogeneous Two-Level Logic and Its Density and Fault Tolerance Implications in Nanoscale Fabrics","volume":"8","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/4663872/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2009","accessionNumber":"10401543","dateOfInsertion":"20 January 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Heterogeneous Two-Level Logic and Its Density and Fault Tolerance Implications in Nanoscale Fabrics","sourcePdf":"tnano-wang-2007645.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.070864S","chronDate":"Jan.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"7729","isNumber":"4757441","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7729","citationCount":"27","xplore-issue":"4757441","articleId":"4663872","onlineDate":"31 October 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4663875,"authors":[{"name":"Sai K.

Robot assisted gait training (RAGT) was developed for stroke survivors using active leg exoskeleton (ALEX) and a force-field controller, which uses assist-as-needed paradigm for rehabilitation. In this paradigm undesirable gait motion is resisted and assistance is provided towards desired motion. The force-field controller achieves this paradigm by effectively applying forces at the ankle of the subject through actuators on the hip and knee joints. Two stroke survivors participated in a 15-session gait training study each with ALEX. The results show that by the end of the training the gait pattern of the patients improved and became closer to a healthy subject's gait pattern. Improvement is seen as an increase in the size of the patients' gait pattern, increased knee and ankle joint excursions and increase in their walking speeds on the treadmill.","doi":"10.1109/TNSRE.2008.2008280","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNSRE.2008.2008280","startPage":"2","endPage":"8","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Systems and Rehabilitation Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Systems and Rehabilitation Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/7333/4782182/04663875.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4782182","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robot Assisted Gait Training With Active Leg Exoskeleton (ALEX)","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4663875/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"31 October 2008","displayDocTitle":"Robot Assisted Gait Training With Active Leg Exoskeleton (ALEX)","volume":"17","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"10 February 2009","accessionNumber":"10478644","pubMedId":"19211317","publicationDate":"Feb. 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4663875/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robot Assisted Gait Training With Active Leg Exoskeleton (ALEX)","sourcePdf":"16tnsre06-sagrawal-2008280.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.072434S","chronDate":"Feb.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"7333","isNumber":"4782182","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7333","citationCount":"481","xplore-issue":"4782182","articleId":"4663875","onlineDate":"31 October 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-22"},{"_id":4663876,"authors":[{"name":"Kan Zheng","affiliation":["Wireless Signal Processing and Network Laboratory, Key Laboratory of Universal Wireless Communication, Ministry of Education, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/4897220/4663876/4663876-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Kan Zheng (M'03) received the B.S., M.S., and Ph.D. degrees from Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications (BUPT), Beijing, China, in 1996, 2000, and 2005, respectively.","Since 2005, he has been with the School of Telecommunication Engineering, BUPT.

The precoder for MIMO transmission is a processing technique that exploits the channel state information (CSI) by operating on the signal before transmission to effectively improve link performance. A hybrid automatic repeat request (HARQ) scheme can be incorporated with the linear precoder to ensure highly reliable communication. To fully utilize the type-I HARQ diversity gain, particularly in slow-fading channels, we propose the optimal design principle of linear precoders whose column vectors are correspondingly orthogonal to each other. In addition, the practical solution based on codebook is given in this paper. Finally, simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed precoders in reducing the detection of bit error rate (BER) and in improving normalized throughput.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4663876/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"31 October 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4663876/","dateOfInsertion":"28 April 2009","publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10601635","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"58","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Design and Performance of Space\u2013Time Precoder With Hybrid ARQ Transmission","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design and Performance of Space\u2013Time Precoder With Hybrid ARQ Transmission","sourcePdf":"tvt-zheng-2003018.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.057151S","chronDate":"May  2009","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"4897220","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"4897220","articleId":"4663876","onlineDate":"31 October 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4663877,"authors":[{"name":"Kai Deng","affiliation":["National Key Laboratory of Communications, University of Electronic Science and Technology, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Kai","lastName":"Deng","id":"37692165900"},{"name":"Youxi Tang","affiliation":["National Key Laboratory of Communications, University of Electronic Science and Technology, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Youxi","lastName":"Tang","id":"37277296700"},{"name":"Shihai Shao","affiliation":["National Key Laboratory of Communications, University of Electronic Science and Technology, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Shihai","lastName":"Shao","id":"37544445300"},{"name":"Ke Sun","affiliation":["National Key Laboratory of Communications, University of Electronic Science and Technology, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Ke","lastName":"Sun","id":"37595181200"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9545"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1939-9359"}],"articleNumber":"4663877","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":13,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":409},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Vehicular Technology Society","url":"http://www.vtsociety.org/"}],"abstract":"This correspondence focuses on the correction of carrier frequency offsets (CFOs) in orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM)-based spatial multiplexing multi-input-multi-output (MIMO) with distributed transmit antennas, where the CFOs between the receiver and each transmit antenna are possibly different.

The associated mean acquisition time (MAT) performance trends are characterized as a function of the number of MIMO elements. Furthermore, we characterize both the initial and post-initial acquisition performance as a function of the relevant system parameters. Our findings suggest that increasing the number of transmit antennas in a MIMO-aided CDMA system results in combining the low-energy noise-contaminated signals of the transmit antennas, which ultimately increases the MAT by an order of magnitude when the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) is relatively low, regardless of whether single- or multipath scenarios are considered. This phenomenon has a detrimental effect on the performance of Rake-receiver-based synchronization schemes when the perfectly synchronized system is capable of attaining its target bit-error-rate performance at reduced SINR values, as a benefit of employing multiple transmit antennas. Based on our analysis justified by information-theoretic considerations, our acquisition design guidelines are applicable to diverse noncoherent (NC) MIMO-assisted scenarios.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multiaccess communication","Downlink","Signal to noise ratio","MIMO","Transmitting antennas","Fading","Timing","Degradation","Rayleigh channels","Information analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","code division multiple access","error statistics","MIMO communication","radio receivers","Rayleigh channels","synchronisation","transmitting antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["post-initial code acquisition","noncoherent MIMO-aided DS-CDMA downlink","multiple input multiple output downlink","direct-sequence code-division multiple-access","spatial uncorrelated Rayleigh channel","mean acquisition time","multiple transmit antenna","signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio","multipath scenario","Rake receiver","synchronization scheme","bit-error-rate"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Initial acquisition","noncoherent (NC) multiple-input/multiple-output (MIMO) system","post-initial acquisition","serial search"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4663879","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2008.2007461","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/4912580/04663879.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2008.2007461","startPage":"2322","endPage":"2330","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4912580","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Initial and Post-Initial Code Acquisition in the Noncoherent Multiple-Input/Multiple-Output-Aided DS-CDMA Downlink","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Initial and Post-Initial Code Acquisition in the Noncoherent Multiple-Input/Multiple-Output-Aided DS-CDMA Downlink","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4663879/","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"31 October 2008","volume":"58","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/4663879/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"08 May 2009","publicationDate":"Jun 2009","accessionNumber":"10645551","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Initial and Post-Initial Code Acquisition in the Noncoherent Multiple-Input/Multiple-Output-Aided DS-CDMA Downlink","sourcePdf":"tvt-hanzo-2007461.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.119934S","chronDate":"Jun  2009","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"4912580","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"4912580","articleId":"4663879","onlineDate":"31 October 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-26"},{"_id":4663880,"authors":[{"name":"Li Wang","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Computer Science (ECS), University of Southampton, Southampton, UK"],"firstName":"Li","lastName":"Wang","id":"37311071400"},{"name":"Lei Xu","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Computer Science (ECS), University of Southampton, Southampton, UK"],"firstName":"Lei","lastName":"Xu","id":"37675869900"},{"name":"Sheng Chen","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Computer Science (ECS), University of Southampton, Southampton, UK"],"firstName":"Sheng","lastName":"Chen","id":"37277597300"},{"name":"Lajos Hanzo","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Computer Science (ECS), University of Southampton, Southampton, UK"],"firstName":"Lajos","lastName":"Hanzo","id":"37276255400"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9545"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1939-9359"}],"articleNumber":"4663880","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":207},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Vehicular Technology Society","url":"http://www.vtsociety.org/"}],"abstract":"The iterative exchange of extrinsic information between the K-best sphere detector (SD) and the channel decoder is appealing since it is capable of achieving a near maximum a posteriori (MAP) performance at a moderate complexity. However, the computational complexity imposed by the K-best SD significantly increases when using a large value of K for the sake of maintaining a near-MAP performance in a high-throughput uplink spatial-division multiple access (SDMA) orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) system supporting a large number of users and/or a high number of bits/symbol. This problem is further aggravated when the number of users/mobile stations (MSs) U exceeds that of the receive antennas N at the base station (BS), namely, in the challenging scenario of rank-deficient systems. We demonstrate that the iterative decoding convergence of this two-stage system may be improved by incorporating a unity rate code (URC) having an infinite impulse response, which improves the efficiency of the extrinsic information exchange. Although this results in a slightly more complex three-stage system architecture, it allows us to use a low-complexity SD having a significantly reduced candidate list size N\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">cand</sub>\n.

For the sake of further enhancing the three-stage concatenated receiver, the proposed iterative center-shifting SD scheme and the irregular convolutional codes (IrCCs) are intrinsically amalgamated,

of imperfect channel estimation. First, the AF relaying is classified into two cases - a variable gain and a fixed gain. For each case, the closed-form average BER is derived by using the moment-generating function (MGF) of the effective output SNR, which quantifies the SNR penalty due to the noisy channel estimate. Moreover, the asymptotic BER bound is also provided at a high SNR regime for the insight of our approach. In particular, the effect of the feedforward delay on informing the source-relay channel estimate as to the destination is presented in the variable-gain relay. Numerical investigation shows that the analytic result makes an exact match with the simulation, and the comparative superiority between the fixed- and variable-gain relay is discussed.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2008.2007644","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/4897220/04663882.pdf","startPage":"2083","endPage":"2088","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2008.2007644","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4897220","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Effect of Channel-Estimation Error on BER Performance in Cooperative Transmission","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4663882","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"31 October 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4663882/","displayDocTitle":"Effect of Channel-Estimation Error on BER Performance in Cooperative Transmission","volume":"58","issue":"4","publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10601638","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4663882/","dateOfInsertion":"28 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Effect of Channel-Estimation Error on BER Performance in Cooperative Transmission","sourcePdf":"tvt-hong-2007644.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.047308S","chronDate":"May  2009","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"4897220","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"92","xplore-issue":"4897220","articleId":"4663882","onlineDate":"31 October 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4663883,"authors":[{"name":"Young-Jun Hong","affiliation":["Samsung Electronics Company Limited, Gyeonggi, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/5062310/4663883/4663883-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Young-Jun Hong (S'04\u2013A'09) received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering from Yonsei University, Seoul, Korea, in 2000 and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST), Daejeon, Korea, in 2002 and 2009, respectively.","Since 2009, he has been a Senior Engineer with Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd., Korea.

We consider the optimal synthesis of a directional beam with full polarization control using an array of electromagnetic vector antennas (EMVA). In such an array, each antenna consists of \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">p</i>\n ges 2 orthogonal electric or magnetic dipole elements. The control of polarization and spatial power patterns is achieved through carefully designing the amplitudes and phases of the weights of these dipole antennas. We formulate the problem in a convex form, which is thus efficiently solvable by existing solvers such as the interior point method. Our results indicate that vector antenna arrays not only enable full polarization control of the beampattern, but also improve the power gain of the main beam (over the sidelobes), where the gain is shown numerically to be linearly proportional to vector antenna dimensionality \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">p</i>\n. This implies that EMVA not only offers the freedom to control the beampattern polarization, but also virtually increases the array size by exploiting the full electromagnetic (EM) field components. We also study the effect of polarization on the spatial power pattern. Our analysis shows that for arrays consisting of pairs of electrical and magnetic dipoles, the spatial power pattern is independent of the mainbeam polarization constraint.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Antenna arrays","Electromagnetic wave polarization","Dipole antennas","Control system synthesis","Linear antenna arrays","Radar antennas","Beams","Optimal control","Communication system control","Directive antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna radiation patterns","dipole antenna arrays","electromagnetic wave polarisation","matrix algebra"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optimal polarized beampattern synthesis","vector antenna array","active sensing systems","radar","directional beam","electromagnetic vector antennas","orthogonal electric dipole elements","magnetic dipole elements","spatial power patterns","interior point method","polarization control","power gain","full electromagnetic field components"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Beampattern synthesis","convex optimization","vector antenna","waveform polarization"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TSP.2008.2007107","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/4773578/04663898.pdf","startPage":"576","endPage":"587","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4773578","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2008.2007107","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal Polarized Beampattern Synthesis Using a Vector Antenna Array","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4663898","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Optimal Polarized Beampattern Synthesis Using a Vector Antenna Array","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4663898/","volume":"57","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Feb. 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4663898/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"10470647","dateOfInsertion":"03 February 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"31 October 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal Polarized Beampattern Synthesis Using a Vector Antenna Array","sourcePdf":"57tsp01-jxiao-2007107.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.08299S","chronDate":"Feb.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"4773578","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"43","xplore-issue":"4773578","articleId":"4663898","onlineDate":"31 October 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4663899,"authors":[{"name":"Soummya Kar","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/4740190/4663899/4663899-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Soummya Kar received the Bachelor of Technology (B.Tech.) degree from the Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur, in May, 2005.","He joined the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Carnegie-Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA, in 2005, where he is currently a third-year Ph.D. degree student.

The smallest error exponent, as a function of the Byzantine sensor population, characterizes the power of attack.

The emphasis is on Capon's MVDR beamformer. We call such an array processor as scatter matrix based (SMB) array processor since the covariance matrix is required only up to a constant scalar and thus a scatter matrix (proportional to covariance under finite covariance assumption) provides sufficient information. In order to establish interesting statistical robustness and large sample properties, we derive a general expression for the influence function and the asymptotic covariance structure of SMB-MVDR beamformer weights. Our results apply under the class of complex elliptically symmetric distributions, which includes the commonly used complex normal distribution as a special case. We illustrate the theory by deriving the IF and asymptotic relative efficiencies of the conventional SMB-MVDR beamformer that employs the sample covariance matrix and beamformers that employ robust \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">M</i>\n -estimators of scatter.

The derivation of the method is based on the presumption that the pdf is a member of a family of distributions very often named as the generalized exponential (GE) class of distributions. Based on high reliability estimations obtained in short simulation/measurement times, the low probably events are estimated accurately by extrapolation. The suggested method can be applied to some distributions that are different from GE distributions, such as noncentral chi-square distributions, to extrapolate to low probability events, with some extrapolation error. It can also be applied to BER estimation. The method is in particular helpful for estimating channels suffering from both severe signal distortion causing undesired intersymbol interference (ISI) of several symbols, and from severe noise. Such conditions prevail, for example, in metro and long haul high-speed optical fiber communication systems. So the method may be implemented in particular in maximum-likelihood sequence estimation (MLSE) optical receivers using nonparametric channel model estimation. A special use of the extrapolation method is explained for practical systems using trellis branch metrics derived from the estimated pdf to decode the transmitted sequence of symbols.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2008.2007608","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2008.2007608","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/4740190/04663913.pdf","startPage":"270","endPage":"278","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4740190","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Tail Extrapolation in MLSE Receivers Using Nonparametric Channel Model Estimation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4663913/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"31 October 2008","displayDocTitle":"Tail Extrapolation in MLSE Receivers Using Nonparametric Channel Model Estimation","volume":"57","issue":"1","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2009","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2009","accessionNumber":"10370397","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4663913/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Tail Extrapolation in MLSE Receivers Using Nonparametric Channel Model Estimation","sourcePdf":"57tsp01-nstojanovic-2007608.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.059819S","chronDate":"Jan.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"4740190","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"4740190","articleId":"4663913","onlineDate":"31 October 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4663914,"authors":[{"name":"Ming Chen","affiliation":["Ericsson AB, Stockholm, Sweden"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/4773578/4663914/4663914-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Ming Chen (M'06) received the M.Sc. degree, the Lic. degree, and the Ph.D. degree in signal processing in 2001, 2005, and 2007, respectively, all from Chalmers University of Technology, G\u00f6teborg, Sweden.","From 1996 to 1999, he was a technical representative with Allgon System AB, Beijing Office, Beijing, China. from 1999 to 2000, he was a Swedish Foundation for International Cooperation in Research and Higher Education (STINT) scholar for studying at Chalmers University of Technology. from 2001 to 2004, he was a research engineer with Ericsson Research, Stockholm, Sweden.

In this paper, we describe the BC optimal power allocation applying this duality in a downstream x-digital subscriber lines (xDSLs) context under a total power constraint for all modems over all tones. Then, a new algorithm called BC-optimal spectrum balancing (BC-OSB) is devised for a more realistic power allocation under per-modem total power constraints. The capacity region of the primal BC problem under per-modem total power constraints is found by the dual optimization problem for the BC under per-modem total power constraints which can be rewritten as a dual optimization problem in the MAC by means of a precoder matrix based on the Lagrange multipliers. We show that the duality gap between the two problems is zero. The multiuser power allocation problem has been solved for interference channels and MAC using the OSB algorithm. In this paper we solve the problem of multiuser power allocation for the BC case using the OSB algorithm as well and we derive a computational efficient algorithm that will be referred to as BC-OSB.

Gaussian model in order to derive estimates that dominate least squares (LS). Recently, the SURE criterion has been employed in a variety of denoising problems for choosing regularization parameters that minimize an estimate of the mean-squared error (MSE). However, its use has been limited to the i.i.d. case which precludes many important applications. In this paper we begin by deriving a SURE counterpart for general, not necessarily i.i.d. distributions from the exponential family. This enables extending the SURE design technique to a much broader class of problems. Based on this generalization we suggest a new method for choosing regularization parameters in penalized LS estimators. We then demonstrate its superior performance over the conventional generalized cross validation and discrepancy approaches in the context of image deblurring and deconvolution. The SURE technique can also be used to design estimates without predefining their structure. However, allowing for too many free parameters impairs the estimate's performance. To address this inherent tradeoff, we propose a regularized SURE objective, and demonstrate its use in the context of wavelet denoising.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Generalized SURE for Exponential Families: Applications to Regularization","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2008.2008212","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/4773578/04663926.pdf","startPage":"471","endPage":"481","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2008.2008212","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4773578","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4663926","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4663926/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"31 October 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2009","displayDocTitle":"Generalized SURE for Exponential Families: Applications to Regularization","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"57","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/4663926/","dateOfInsertion":"03 February 2009","publicationDate":"Feb. 2009","accessionNumber":"10470665","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Generalized SURE for Exponential Families: Applications to Regularization","sourcePdf":"57tsp01-yeldar-2008212.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.075132S","chronDate":"Feb.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"4773578","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"148","xplore-issue":"4773578","articleId":"4663926","onlineDate":"31 October 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-29"},{"_id":4663927,"authors":[{"name":"Jian-Kang Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, McMaster University, Hamilton, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Jian-Kang","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37281463700"},{"name":"Wing-Kin Ma","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Chinese University of Hong Kong, New Territories, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Wing-Kin","lastName":"Ma","id":"37274385900"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1053-587X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0476"}],"articleNumber":"4663927","dbTime":"16 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":23,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":483},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.signalprocessingsociety.org"}],"abstract":"In this paper, we consider a systematic design of a full diversity blind Alamouti space-time block code for a wireless communication system having two transmitter antennas and a single receiver antenna, in which the channel is completely unknown at both the transmitter and the receiver. The key idea is to alternatively transmit Alamouti codes with different phase shift keying (PSK) constellations, say, with \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">p</i>\n -PSK and \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">q</i>\n -PSK. To provide the theoretical analysis of its unique identification and full diversity conditions, we first establish a general theorem for factorizing a \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">pq</i>\n-PSK constellation into a product of a \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">p</i>\n -PSK constellation and a \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">q</i>\n -PSK constellation. Then, we prove that a necessary and sufficient condition for both the factorization and a set of solutions of the resulting Alamouti Diophantine equation from our code design to be unique is that \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">p</i>\n and \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">q</i>\n are coprime. The same condition assures that the channel and the transmitted signal can be blindly and uniquely identified. Furthermore, a closed-form solution to determine the channel coefficients and the transmitted symbols are obtained. Also, we prove that our code enables full diversity for the generalized-likelihood ratio test (GLRT) receiver if \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">p</i>\n and \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">q</i>\n are coprime. When finite length of the received data is available, the unitarity and linearity of our code design allow us to utilize the semi-definite relaxation (SDR) decoder or the sphere decoder so that the joint estimation of the channel and symbols can be efficiently implemented.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/4773578/04663927.pdf","startPage":"635","endPage":"644","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2008.2008218","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2008.2008218","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4773578","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4663927","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Full Diversity Blind Alamouti Space\u2013Time Block Codes for Unique Identification of Flat-Fading Channels","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Block codes","Transmitters","Receiving antennas","Transmitting antennas","Phase shift keying","Decoding","Wireless communication","Sufficient conditions","Equations","Signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["block codes","fading channels","phase shift keying","space-time codes","transmitting antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["space-time block codes","full diversity blind Alamouti codes","unique identification","flat-fading channels","wireless communication","two transmitter antennas","single receiver antenna","phase shift keying","Alamouti Diophantine equation","generalized-likelihood ratio test receiver","semidefinite relaxation decoder"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Alamouti space\u2013time block code","blind unique identification","Diophantine equation","full diversity","PSK constellation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4663927/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"31 October 2008","displayDocTitle":"Full Diversity Blind Alamouti Space\u2013Time Block Codes for Unique Identification of Flat-Fading Channels","volume":"57","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/4663927/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2009","accessionNumber":"10498651","dateOfInsertion":"03 February 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Full Diversity Blind Alamouti Space\u2013Time Block Codes for Unique Identification of Flat-Fading Channels","sourcePdf":"57tsp01-jzhang-2008218.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.07368S","chronDate":"Feb.  2009","isNumber":"4773578","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"23","articleId":"4663927","onlineDate":"31 October 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4663930,"authors":[{"name":"Pengwei Hao","affiliation":["Center of Information Science, Peking University, Beijing, China","Department of Computer Science, Queen Mary, University of London, UK"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/4773578/4663930/4663930-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Pengwei Hao (M'98) was born in the north of Shaanxi Province, China, in 1966.

In this paper, we prove that signal resampling based on polynomial interpolation can be reversible even for integer signals, i.e., the original signal can be reconstructed losslessly from the resampled data. By using matrix factorization, we also propose a reversible method for uniform shifted resampling and uniform scaled and shifted resampling. The new factorization yields three elementary integer-reversible matrices. The method is actually a new way to compute linear transforms and a lossless integer implementation of linear transforms with the factor matrices. It can be applied to integer signals by in-place integer-reversible computation, which needs no auxiliary memory to keep the original sample data for the transformation during the process or for ldquoundordquo recovery after the process. Some examples of low-order resampling solutions are also presented in this paper and our experiments show that the resampling error relative to the original signal is comparable to that of the traditional irreversible resampling.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2008.2008243","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2008.2008243","startPage":"516","endPage":"525","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/4773578/04663930.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4773578","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reversible Resampling of Integer Signals","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"31 October 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2009","displayDocTitle":"Reversible Resampling of Integer Signals","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"03 February 2009","volume":"57","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4663930/","accessionNumber":"10470654","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4663930/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reversible Resampling of Integer Signals","sourcePdf":"57tsp02-phao-2008243.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.071976S","chronDate":"Feb.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"4773578","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4773578","articleId":"4663930","onlineDate":"31 October 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4663931,"authors":[{"name":"Walid Hachem","affiliation":["CNRS Telecom Paris Tech, Paris, France"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/4773578/4663931/4663931-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Walid Hachem was born in Bhamdoun, Lebanon, in 1967.

We introduce three levels of the duality which allow for a problem specific customization with different computational complexities and resolutions. The first level preserves the \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">sum</i>\n-MSE during the conversion from the uplink to the downlink and vice versa, whereas the second level not only keeps the sum-MSE constant but also ensures the preservation of the individual users' MSEs. The third level involves the finest resolution and preserves the individual streams' MSEs and the individual streams' signal-to-interference-and-noise ratio (SINR) simultaneously. In contrast with hitherto existing MSE-dualities, the proposed sort of duality features a lower complexity since no MSE computation detouring is necessary during the conversion to the dual domain and is capable of handling all combinations of active and passive transmitters and receivers. Moreover, we show how two of these three dualities can be exploited to solve the unweighted total sum-MSE minimization problem and the weighted sum-MSE minimization in the broadcast channel in an efficient way by revealing the hidden convexity in the first case and drastically reducing the computational complexity in the latter case.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2008.2008253","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/4773578/04663933.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2008.2008253","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4773578","startPage":"698","endPage":"713","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the MSE-Duality of the Broadcast Channel and the Multiple Access Channel","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4663933","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"On the MSE-Duality of the Broadcast Channel and the Multiple Access Channel","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4663933/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"31 October 2008","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"57","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Feb. 2009","accessionNumber":"10470657","dateOfInsertion":"03 February 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4663933/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the MSE-Duality of the Broadcast Channel and the Multiple Access Channel","sourcePdf":"57tsp02-rhunger-2008253.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.187017S","chronDate":"Feb.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"4773578","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"87","xplore-issue":"4773578","articleId":"4663933","onlineDate":"31 October 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4663934,"authors":[{"name":"Rui Zhang","affiliation":["Institute for Infocomm Research, Singapore"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/4773578/4663934/4663934-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Rui Zhang (S'00-M'07) received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in electrical and computer engineering from National University of Singapore in 2000 and 2001, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from Stanford University, Stanford, CA, in 2007.","Since 2007, he has been a research fellow with the Institute for Infocomm Research (I2R), Singapore.

We apply two well-known criteria in the literature, namely, the ldquoSINR balancingrdquo and the ldquochannel-inversion,rdquo for the design of linear precoding in the traditional nonrelay-assisted multiantenna BC to the relay-assisted multiantenna BC. First, a convergence-ensured iterative SINR-balancing algorithm is proposed to successively in turn optimize the transmit parameters at one station (BS or RS) with those at the other station being fixed. Second, a joint BS and RS channel-inversion algorithm is proposed together with a novel technique, termed ldquoeigenmode switching,rdquo at the RS to reduce the power penalty of the channel inversion. Simulation results show that the proposed joint beamforming and power control schemes provide substantial power savings to achieve the assigned user QoS constraints.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2008.2008254","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/4773578/04663934.pdf","startPage":"726","endPage":"737","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2008.2008254","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4773578","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint Beamforming and Power Control for Multiantenna Relay Broadcast Channel With QoS Constraints","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4663934/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"31 October 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2009","displayDocTitle":"Joint Beamforming and Power Control for Multiantenna Relay Broadcast Channel With QoS Constraints","volume":"57","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2009","accessionNumber":"10470658","htmlLink":"/document/4663934/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"03 February 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint Beamforming and Power Control for Multiantenna Relay Broadcast Channel With QoS Constraints","sourcePdf":"57tsp02-rzhang-2008254.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.107615S","chronDate":"Feb.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"4773578","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"142","xplore-issue":"4773578","articleId":"4663934","onlineDate":"31 October 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":4663937,"authors":[{"name":"Daniel E.

The sensor observations are corrupted by bounded additive noise. The study focuses on the extremes of lack of deterministic control in the sensor deployment, lack of knowledge of the noise distribution, and lack of sensing precision and reliability. Such adverse conditions are motivated by possible real-world scenarios where a large collection of low-cost, crudely manufactured sensors are mass-deployed in an environment where little can be assumed about the ambient noise. A simple estimator that reconstructs the entire field from these unreliable, binary-quantized, noisy observations is proposed. Technical conditions for the almost sure and mean squared error (MSE) convergence of the estimate to the field, as the number of sensors tends to infinity, are derived and their implications are discussed.

However, in practical wireless systems, the channel state information is prone to errors, which sometimes deteriorates the performance drastically. In this paper, we address the problem of robust transceiver design in a downlink multiuser system, with respect to the erroneous channel knowledge at the transmitter. The base station is equipped with an antenna array, while users have single antennas. The transceiver optimization is performed under a set of predefined users' quality-of-service constraints, defined as maximum mean square errors, or minimum signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratios (SINRs), which must be satisfied for all disturbances that belong to given, bounded uncertainty sets. Efficient numerical solutions are obtained using semidefinite programming methods from convex optimization theory. The proposed algorithms are found to outperform related approaches in the literature in terms of the achieved performance, while maintaining low computational complexity. The studied uncertainty models are applicable in mitigating typical errors that emerge as a result of quantization or channel estimation.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4663943/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"31 October 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2009","volume":"57","issue":"2","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10470651","dateOfInsertion":"03 February 2009","publicationDate":"Feb. 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4663943/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Robust QoS-Constrained Optimization of Downlink Multiuser MISO Systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust QoS-Constrained Optimization of Downlink Multiuser MISO Systems","sourcePdf":"tsp-vucic-2008553.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.118155S","chronDate":"Feb.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"4773578","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"147","xplore-issue":"4773578","articleId":"4663943","onlineDate":"31 October 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4663944,"authors":[{"name":"Wei Liu","affiliation":["Signal Processing for Communications Group, School of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, Leeds, U.K."],"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Liu","id":"37279769000"},{"name":"Des C.

In the first part of the paper, we present a finite-sample performance analysis of the well-known manifold separation (MS) based root-MUSIC technique. Then, we propose a new class of search-free DOA estimation methods applicable to arrays of arbitrary geometry and establish their relationship to the MS approach. Our first technique is referred to as Fourier-domain (FD) root-MUSIC and is based on the fact that the spectral MUSIC function is periodic in angle. It uses the Fourier series to expand this function and reformulate the underlying DOA estimation problem as an equivalent polynomial rooting problem. Our second approach applies the zero-padded inverse Fourier transform to the FD root-MUSIC polynomial to avoid the polynomial rooting step and replace it with a simple line search. Our third technique refines the FD root-MUSIC approach by using weighted least-squares approximation to compute the polynomial coefficients. The proposed techniques are shown to offer substantially improved performance-to-complexity tradeoffs as compared to the MS technique.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2008.2008560","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/4773578/04663945.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2008.2008560","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4773578","startPage":"588","endPage":"599","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Direction-of-Arrival Estimation for Nonuniform Sensor Arrays: From Manifold Separation to Fourier Domain MUSIC Methods","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4663945","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Direction-of-Arrival Estimation for Nonuniform Sensor Arrays: From Manifold Separation to Fourier Domain MUSIC Methods","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4663945/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"31 October 2008","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"57","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Feb. 2009","accessionNumber":"10470638","dateOfInsertion":"03 February 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4663945/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Direction-of-Arrival Estimation for Nonuniform Sensor Arrays: From Manifold Separation to Fourier Domain MUSIC Methods","sourcePdf":"tsp-gershman-2008560.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.084464S","chronDate":"Feb.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"4773578","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"95","xplore-issue":"4773578","articleId":"4663945","onlineDate":"31 October 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4663946,"authors":[{"name":"Khoa T.

Both correlations at the transmitter and receiver are assumed to be present, and only statistical channel state information in the form of the transmit and receive correlation matrices is assumed to be available at the transmitter. The convexity of the design based on SER minimization is established and exploited. The advantage of the developed technique is its low complexity. We also find various relationships of the proposed designs to the existing precoding techniques, and derive very simple closed-form precoders for special cases such as two or three receive antennas and constant receive correlation. The numerical simulations illustrate the excellent SER performance of the proposed precoders.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2008.2008563","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/4773578/04663946.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2008.2008563","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4773578","startPage":"814","endPage":"819","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Precoder Design for Space-Time Coded Systems Over Correlated Rayleigh Fading Channels Using Convex Optimization","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4663946","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Precoder Design for Space-Time Coded Systems Over Correlated Rayleigh Fading Channels Using Convex Optimization","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4663946/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"31 October 2008","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"57","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Feb. 2009","accessionNumber":"10470660","dateOfInsertion":"03 February 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4663946/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Precoder Design for Space-Time Coded Systems Over Correlated Rayleigh Fading Channels Using Convex Optimization","sourcePdf":"tsp-vorobyov-2008563.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.055859S","chronDate":"Feb.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"4773578","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"4773578","articleId":"4663946","onlineDate":"31 October 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4663952,"authors":[{"name":"Taesoo Kwon","affiliation":["Samsung Electronics Company Limited, Yongin si, South Korea","Department of Electrical Engineering, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejeon, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/5062310/4663952/4663952-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Taesoo Kwon (S'01\u2013M'07) received the B.S., M.S., and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering and computer science from the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST), Daejeon, Korea, in 2001, 2003, and 2007, respectively.","Since 2007, he has been with Samsung Electronics, Yongin, Korea, where he has been engaged in research on beyond 4G wireless communication.

For these link-adaptive schemes to be applied, resources have to be adaptively and dynamically allocated every frame. Thus, the system needs control messages to send information to users about dynamic resource allocation. Such information includes user ID, resource position, level of modulation, and coding and automatic repeat request (ARQ) information. However, the transmission of these resource-allocation messages causes control overhead. In this paper, we introduce a scheme that applies AMC to the transmission of resource-allocation messages and analyze its performance in systems that support truncated ARQ, such as link-layer ARQ and HARQ. In addition, we show that using AMC to transmit control messages is a good way to reduce control overhead; in particular, it is very effective when the number of users per frame is large, as in voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) services.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2008.2008651","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/5062310/04663952.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2008.2008651","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5062310","startPage":"2769","endPage":"2782","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive-Modulation-and-Coding-Based Transmission of Control Messages for Resource Allocation in Mobile Communication Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4663952","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive-Modulation-and-Coding-Based Transmission of Control Messages for Resource Allocation in Mobile Communication Systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4663952/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"31 October 2008","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"58","issue":"6","publicationDate":"July 2009","accessionNumber":"10712961","dateOfInsertion":"02 June 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4663952/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive-Modulation-and-Coding-Based Transmission of Control Messages for Resource Allocation in Mobile Communication Systems","sourcePdf":"tvt-kwon-2008651.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.073641S","chronDate":"July  2009","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"5062310","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"5062310","articleId":"4663952","onlineDate":"31 October 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4663953,"authors":[{"name":"Pei Xiao","affiliation":["Institute of Electrical Engineering, and Computer Science, Queen's University, Belfast, UK"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/4912580/4663953/4663953-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Pei Xiao (M'04) received the B.Eng. degree from the Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China, the M.Sc. and Licentiate of Technology degrees from the Tampere University of Technology, Tampere, Finland, and the Licentiate of Engineering and the Ph.D. degrees from the Chalmers University of Technology, G\u00f6teborg, Sweden.","After receiving the M.Sc. degree, he was with Nokia Networks, Tampere, Finland.

The converter conserves inherent advantages of a conventional current-fed push-pull converter such as low input-current stress and high voltage conversion ratio. Also, a voltage-doubler rectifier is employed in order to remove the reverse-recovery problem of the output rectifying diodes and provide much higher voltage conversion ratio. The current ripple reduction control without an external component is suggested. Therefore, the proposed system operates in a wide input-voltage range with a high efficiency. By using a current-ripple reduction control, the input current ripple is furthermore reduced. A 1.5-kW prototype is implemented with input-voltage range from 30 to 70 V. Experimental results show that minimum efficiency at full load is about 92.5% and that ripple current is less than 2% of the rated input current.","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2008.2004393","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/41/4796879/04663956.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2008.2004393","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4796879","startPage":"826","endPage":"834","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High-Efficiency Fuel Cell Power Conditioning System With Input Current Ripple Reduction","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4663956","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"High-Efficiency Fuel Cell Power Conditioning System With Input Current Ripple Reduction","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4663956/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"31 October 2008","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"56","issue":"3","publicationDate":"March 2009","accessionNumber":"10500864","dateOfInsertion":"27 February 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4663956/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High-Efficiency Fuel Cell Power Conditioning System With Input Current Ripple Reduction","sourcePdf":"tie-kwon-2004393.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.062912S","chronDate":"March  2009","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"4796879","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"164","xplore-issue":"4796879","articleId":"4663956","onlineDate":"31 October 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4663957,"authors":[{"name":"Rijaniaina Njakasoa Andriamalala","affiliation":["Groupe de Recherche en Electrotechnique et Electronique de Nancy, Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique-Unit\u00e9 Mixte de Recherche 7037, Universit\u00e9 Henri Poincar\u00e9, Vandoeuvre-les-Nancy, France"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/4681672/4663957/4663957-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Rijaniaina Njakasoa Andriamalala was born in Ambohitrolomahitsy, Madagascar.

This induction machine has two sets of stator three-phase windings electrically shifted by an angle alpha. This model will be used to analyze the impact of the defect on the machine. It will be seen that the analytical expression of inductances can be directly exploited to predict the eccentricity-related frequencies. First, the impact of the defect will be investigated under an open-loop condition, i.e., the motor will be supplied by the volt-per-hertz control mode. Second, the motors will be supplied by using the indirect rotor field-oriented control. One will see the fault propagation on the control variables, which can be used as a tool for diagnosis under closed-loop conditions.

The selection process logic involving equipment, personnel considerations and commissioning will all be addressed.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Arc-flash incident energy reduction using zone selective interlocking","publicationTitle":"2008 55th IEEE Petroleum and Chemical Industry Technical Conference","doi":"10.1109/PCICON.2008.4663965","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 55th IEEE Petroleum and Chemical Industry Technical Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4655280/4663961/04663965.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"9","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PCICON.2008.4663965","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4663961","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4663965","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4663965/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 Sept. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Arc-flash incident energy reduction using zone selective interlocking","conferenceDate":"22-24 Sept. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4663965/","dateOfInsertion":"31 October 2008","publicationDate":"Sept. 2008","accessionNumber":"10387525","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Arc-flash incident energy reduction using zone selective interlocking","confLoc":"Cincinnati, OH, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-10282008-00004.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059097S","chronDate":"22-24 Sept. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4655280","isNumber":"4663961","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4655280","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4663961","articleId":"4663965","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4664088,"authors":[{"name":"Bradley Oraw","affiliation":["Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ, USA"],"firstName":"Bradley","lastName":"Oraw","id":"37830654900"},{"name":"Rajapandian Ayyanar","affiliation":["Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ, USA"],"firstName":"Rajapandian","lastName":"Ayyanar","id":"37274952500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2055-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2056-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0275-0473"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2158-5210"}],"articleNumber":"4664088","dbTime":"24 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":552},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Switches","Inductors","Integrated circuit modeling","Resistance","Converters","Capacitors","Switching converters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["DC-DC power convertors","switching convertors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["large signal average model","extended duty ratio","buck type DC-DC converters","large signal dynamics","lossy switches","conduction losses","2-phase extended duty ratio buck converter","extended duty ratio topology"]}],"abstract":"This paper provides a new large signal modeling approach for Buck type DCDC converters.

We consider minimizing the number of Line Terminating Equipment (LTE) on two types of unidirectional rings, namely, single-hub and un-hubbed rings, as our objective. In single-hub rings, we investigate the minimum cost provisioning of uniform all-to-all traffic in two cases: where network coding is used to linearly combine data, and where it is not used and data is transmitted without coding. We generalize the service mode to many-to-many and evaluate the cost of provisioning. In un-hubbed ring, we propose a multi-hub approach to obtain the minimum cost provisioning in the case of all-to-all and many-to-many traffic. From our numerical results, we find that under many to many traffic, network coding can reduce the network cost by 10-20% in single-hub rings and 1-5% in un-hubbed rings.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4664131","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LCN.2008.4664153","publicationTitle":"2008 33rd IEEE Conference on Local Computer Networks (LCN)","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 33rd IEEE Conference on Local Computer Networks (LCN)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4656373/4664131/04664153.pdf","startPage":"66","endPage":"73","doi":"10.1109/LCN.2008.4664153","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reducing network cost of many-to-many communication in unidirectional WDM rings with network coding","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-17 Oct. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Reducing network cost of many-to-many communication in unidirectional WDM rings with network coding","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"14-17 Oct. 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4664153/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10392089","dateOfInsertion":"31 October 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4664153/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reducing network cost of many-to-many communication in unidirectional WDM rings with network coding","confLoc":"Montreal, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"SPI-10242008-00022.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.095S","chronDate":"14-17 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4656373","isNumber":"4664131","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4656373","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4664131","articleId":"4664153","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4664158,"authors":[{"name":"MingJian Tang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Computer Engineering, La Trobe University, Melbourne, Australia"],"firstName":"MingJian","lastName":"Tang","id":"37712375900"},{"name":"Jinli Cao","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Computer Engineering, La Trobe University, Melbourne, Australia"],"firstName":"Jinli","lastName":"Cao","id":"37420640800"},{"name":"Xiaohua Jia","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, City University of Hong Kong, Kowloon, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Xiaohua","lastName":"Jia","id":"37274086100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2412-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2413-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0742-1303"}],"articleNumber":"4664158","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":3,"totalDownloads":205},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4664158","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wireless sensor networks","Sleep","Base stations","IP networks","Schedules","Energy efficiency","Accuracy"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["telecommunication network management","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wireless sensor networks","energy-efficient continuous data collection services","data-driven power management","approximate querying","sleep scheduling","sensor data quality","precision-guaranteed estimation","decentralized algorithms","communication delays","staggered local sleep schedules"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["approximate query","multi-objective optimization","sleep scheduling","wireless sensor networks"]}],"abstract":"Providing energy-efficient continuous data collection services is of paramount importance to Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) applications. This paper proposes a new power management framework called Data-Driven Power Management (DDPM) as the infrastructure for integrating various energy efficient techniques, such as the approximate querying and the sleep scheduling. By utilizing the beneficial properties of these techniques, we can achieve better energy efficiency while still meeting the application specific criteria, such as data accuracy and communication latency. The distinguishing feature of DDPM is that it starts by exploiting the natural tradeoff between the quality of the sensor data and the energy consumption, and then it generates a precision-guaranteed estimation for each sensor node as its maximum sleep time. Eventually deterministic schedules can be made by the DDPM based on these estimations. We further propose two decentralized algorithms so that the undesirable communication delays caused by staggered local sleep schedules can be avoided. The experimental results show that the nodespsila sleep times can be significantly increased while incurring only a minor rise in latency.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4664131","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LCN.2008.4664158","publicationTitle":"2008 33rd IEEE Conference on Local Computer Networks (LCN)","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 33rd IEEE Conference on Local Computer Networks (LCN)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4656373/4664131/04664158.pdf","startPage":"106","endPage":"113","doi":"10.1109/LCN.2008.4664158","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient power management for Wireless Sensor Networks: A data-driven approach","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-17 Oct. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Efficient power management for Wireless Sensor Networks: A data-driven approach","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"14-17 Oct. 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4664158/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10392091","dateOfInsertion":"31 October 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4664158/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient power management for Wireless Sensor Networks: A data-driven approach","confLoc":"Montreal, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"SPI-10242008-00027.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.095165S","chronDate":"14-17 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4656373","isNumber":"4664131","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4656373","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4664131","articleId":"4664158","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":4664195,"authors":[{"name":"Kandaraj Piamrat","affiliation":["INRIA Rennes Bretagne Atlantique, Rennes, France"],"firstName":"Kandaraj","lastName":"Piamrat","id":"37299021200"},{"name":"Adlen Ksentini","affiliation":["IRISA, University of Rennes I, Rennes, France"],"firstName":"Adlen","lastName":"Ksentini","id":"37284835700"},{"name":"Cesar Viho","affiliation":["IRISA, University of Rennes I, Rennes, France"],"firstName":"Cesar","lastName":"Viho","id":"37294538100"},{"name":"Jean-Marie Bonnin","affiliation":["Telecom Bretagne, France"],"firstName":"Jean-Marie","lastName":"Bonnin","id":"37313112600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2412-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2413-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0742-1303"}],"articleNumber":"4664195","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":25,"citationCountPatent":3,"totalDownloads":559},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4664195","abstract":"Widespread use of wireless networks nowadays raises many challenging issues to be explored. With increasing of multimedia traffic, quality of experience (QoE) needs to be satisfied at users while overall performance needs to be maintained at networks. In order to achieve these goals, the use of network selection mechanism is inevitable. When several access points are present, user should select the best available network while trying to keep load balanced between access networks. In this paper, we present a user-based and network-assisted scheme for network selection in wireless IEEE 802.11 technology. By providing users in decision making process with relevant information about the networks, the proposed solution keeps compromising advantage for both user and network. Our mechanism is based on a technique called pseudo-subjective quality assessment (PSQA), which is used basically to measure quality of experience perceived by users. We propose a new scheme where PSQA tool is used to assist in terminal-centric network selection. We explain the scheme and illustrate its efficient performance compared to a signal-based mechanism.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Probes","Streaming media","Recurrent neural networks","Databases","IEEE 802.11 Standards","Real time systems","Monitoring"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multimedia communication","quality of service","telecommunication traffic","wireless LAN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["QoE-based network selection","multimedia users","IEEE 802.11 wireless networks","multimedia traffic","quality of experience","network selection mechanism","pseudo-subjective quality assessment","terminal-centric network selection"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["IEEE 802.11","IEEE 802.11k","Network Selection","Quality of Experience (QoE)"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4664131","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LCN.2008.4664195","startPage":"388","endPage":"394","publicationTitle":"2008 33rd IEEE Conference on Local Computer Networks (LCN)","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 33rd IEEE Conference on Local Computer Networks (LCN)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4656373/4664131/04664195.pdf","doi":"10.1109/LCN.2008.4664195","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"QoE-based network selection for multimedia users in IEEE 802.11 wireless networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"QoE-based network selection for multimedia users in IEEE 802.11 wireless networks","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10392110","publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"14-17 Oct. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"31 October 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4664195/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4664195/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-17 Oct. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"QoE-based network selection for multimedia users in IEEE 802.11 wireless networks","confLoc":"Montreal, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"SPI-10242008-00064.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045301S","chronDate":"14-17 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4656373","isNumber":"4664131","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4656373","citationCount":"25","xplore-issue":"4664131","articleId":"4664195","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4664207,"authors":[{"name":"Taimour Aldalgamouni","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, Concordia University, Montreal, Canada"],"firstName":"Taimour","lastName":"Aldalgamouni","id":"37601303900"},{"name":"Ahmed Elhakeem","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, Concordia University, Montreal, Canada"],"firstName":"Ahmed","lastName":"Elhakeem","id":"37269433800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2412-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2413-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0742-1303"}],"articleNumber":"4664207","dbTime":"15 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":5,"totalDownloads":68},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Bit error rate","Correlation","OFDM","Coherence","Arrays","Channel estimation","Antenna arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","block codes","channel estimation","code division multiple access","error statistics","MIMO communication","resource allocation","transceivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["space frequency block code","code division multiple access","SFBC-CDMA systems","optimized resource allocation","base transceiver stations","antenna array sub system","frequency subcarrier blocks","channel coherence time","channel estimation error","multiple input multiple output operation","MIMO operation","bit error rate"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Resource Allocation","Optimization","CDMA","SFBC"]}],"abstract":"In this paper we present an optimized resource allocation algorithm for the uplink of space frequency block coded code division multiple access (SFBC-CDMA) systems.

In this paper, we expand our work to accommodate the heterogeneous nature of traffic in future networks. More importantly, we derive a mathematical model to involve more realistic considerations for inter-cell interference in a system with mixed coverage. Based on different load scenarios in a hotspot area and different coverage combinations of the loaded and supporting sectors, the model is used to quantify the degradation level in the QoS parameters of low priority traffic to preserve the QoS level of high priority traffic. Achievable data rates and Bit Error Rates (BER) are determined for every possible coverage combination. The effect of rate and coverage adaptation on the transmission powers of mobile users is also analyzed.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"QoS provisioning in WCDMA cellular networks through rate and coverage adaptation","publicationTitle":"2008 33rd IEEE Conference on Local Computer Networks (LCN)","doi":"10.1109/LCN.2008.4664262","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 33rd IEEE Conference on Local Computer Networks (LCN)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4656373/4664131/04664262.pdf","startPage":"661","endPage":"666","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LCN.2008.4664262","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4664131","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4664262","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4664262/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-17 Oct. 2008","displayDocTitle":"QoS provisioning in WCDMA cellular networks through rate and coverage adaptation","conferenceDate":"14-17 Oct. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4664262/","dateOfInsertion":"31 October 2008","publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10392143","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"QoS provisioning in WCDMA cellular networks through rate and coverage adaptation","confLoc":"Montreal, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"SPI-10242008-00131.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043936S","chronDate":"14-17 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4656373","isNumber":"4664131","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4656373","xplore-issue":"4664131","articleId":"4664262","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4664273,"authors":[{"name":"Darren Moore","affiliation":["Autonomous Systems Laboratory, CSIRO ICT Centre, Australia"],"firstName":"Darren","lastName":"Moore","id":"37550388700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2412-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2413-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0742-1303"}],"articleNumber":"4664273","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":130},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4664273","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Computational modeling","Birds","Wireless sensor networks","Real time systems","Feature extraction","Biological system modeling","Acoustics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["acoustic signal detection","acoustic signal processing","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bird species detection","acoustic wireless sensor network","likelihood ratio test","statistical models","DSP coprocessor","signal processing","signal detection","logrunner"]}],"doi":"10.1109/LCN.2008.4664273","pdfPath":"/iel5/4656373/4664131/04664273.pdf","publicationTitle":"2008 33rd IEEE Conference on Local Computer Networks (LCN)","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 33rd IEEE Conference on Local Computer Networks (LCN)","startPage":"730","endPage":"731","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4664131","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LCN.2008.4664273","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Demonstration of bird species detection using an acoustic wireless sensor network","abstract":"A wireless sensor network application for detection of bird calls is described.

Providing wideband access for a variety of applications has led to the inception of WIMAX. Classic access techniques such as FDMA and TDMA have been norm for such networks. Their maximum transmitter power is much less than their TDMA and FDMA counter parts, which are very important assets for mobile operation. In this paper we introduce a code division multiple access/Time division duplex technique CDMA/TDD for such networks. The CDMA approach is an almost play and plug technology for wireless access, making it amenable for implementation by WIMAX service station. In addition we adopt a virtual circuit (label) to improve packet overhead efficiency. We outline briefly the new transmitter and receiver structures then evaluate efficiency, delay and delay jitter. By analysis we show the advantages over classic counter parts with respect to total network efficiency achievable especially for larger number of hops.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"CDMA/MPLS platforms for WIMAX mesh networks","publicationTitle":"2008 33rd IEEE Conference on Local Computer Networks (LCN)","doi":"10.1109/LCN.2008.4664292","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 33rd IEEE Conference on Local Computer Networks (LCN)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4656373/4664131/04664292.pdf","startPage":"851","endPage":"858","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LCN.2008.4664292","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4664131","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4664292","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4664292/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-17 Oct. 2008","displayDocTitle":"CDMA/MPLS platforms for WIMAX mesh networks","conferenceDate":"14-17 Oct. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4664292/","dateOfInsertion":"31 October 2008","publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10392159","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"CDMA/MPLS platforms for WIMAX mesh networks","confLoc":"Montreal, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"SPI-10242008-00161.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065891S","chronDate":"14-17 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4656373","isNumber":"4664131","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4656373","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4664131","articleId":"4664292","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4664304,"authors":[{"name":"Karim Tabia","affiliation":["CRIL CNRS UMR, Artois University, France"],"firstName":"Karim","lastName":"Tabia","id":"37657855000"},{"name":"Salem Benferhat","affiliation":["CRIL CNRS UMR, Artois University, France"],"firstName":"Salem","lastName":"Benferhat","id":"37271885100"},{"name":"Yassine Djouadi","affiliation":["Computer Science Department, Tizi Ouzou University, Algeria"],"firstName":"Yassine","lastName":"Djouadi","id":"37870480300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2412-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2413-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0742-1303"}],"articleNumber":"4664304","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":88},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Bayesian methods","Computational modeling","Training","Data models","Intrusion detection","Training data","Real time systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["security of data","Web sites"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["two-stage aggregation/thresholding scheme","multi-model anomaly-based approaches","anomaly score aggregation","aggregating function"]}],"abstract":"This paper deals with anomaly score aggregation and thresholding in multi-model anomaly-based approaches which require multiple detection models and profiles in order to characterize the different aspects of normal activities. Most works focus on profile/model definition while critical issues related to anomaly measuring, aggregating and thresholding have not received similar attention. In this paper, we in particular address the issue of anomaly scoring and aggregating which is a recurring problem in multi-model anomaly-based approaches. We propose a two stage aggregation/thresholding scheme particularly suitable for multi-model anomaly-based approaches. The basic idea of our scheme is the fact that anomalous behaviors induce either intramodel anomalies or inter-model ones. Our scheme is designed for real-time detection of both intra-model and inter-model anomalies. More precisely, we propose local thresholding in order to detect intra-model anomalies and use a Bayesian network in order to, on one hand, extract inter-model regularities and serve, on the other hand, as an aggregating function for computing the overall anomaly score associated with each analyzed audit event. Our experimental studies, carried out on recent and real \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">http</i>\n traffic, show for instance that most Web-based attacks induce only intra-model anomalies and can be effectively detected in real-time. Moreover, this scheme significantly improves the detection rate of Web-based attacks involving inter-model anomalies.","doi":"10.1109/LCN.2008.4664304","publicationTitle":"2008 33rd IEEE Conference on Local Computer Networks (LCN)","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 33rd IEEE Conference on Local Computer Networks (LCN)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4656373/4664131/04664304.pdf","startPage":"919","endPage":"926","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LCN.2008.4664304","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4664131","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A two-stage aggregation/thresholding scheme for multi-model anomaly-based approaches","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4664304","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-17 Oct. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4664304/","displayDocTitle":"A two-stage aggregation/thresholding scheme for multi-model anomaly-based approaches","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10392164","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4664304/","conferenceDate":"14-17 Oct. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"31 October 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A two-stage aggregation/thresholding scheme for multi-model anomaly-based approaches","confLoc":"Montreal, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"SPI-10242008-00173.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05788S","chronDate":"14-17 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4656373","isNumber":"4664131","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4656373","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4664131","articleId":"4664304","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4664329,"authors":[{"name":"Francesco Maria Aymerich","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Cagliari, Italy"],"firstName":"Francesco Maria","lastName":"Aymerich","id":"37265289900"},{"name":"Gianni Fenu","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Cagliari, Italy"],"firstName":"Gianni","lastName":"Fenu","id":"37408437400"},{"name":"Simone Surcis","affiliation":["Cosmolab Consortium, Cagliari, Italy"],"firstName":"Simone","lastName":"Surcis","id":"37869394600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2623-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2624-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4664329","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":84,"citationCountPatent":3,"totalDownloads":2683},"keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cosmology","grid computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing network","grid computing","large scale supply","computational resources","Cybersar Project"]}],"abstract":"ldquoCloud Computingrdquo is becoming increasingly relevant, as it will enable companies involved in spreading this technology to open the doors to Web 3.0.

As it is known, accurate forecasting is important for both gas distributors and consumers. On the view point of distributors, with accurate forecasting the number of false alarms would be significantly decreased and transship limits would be scheduled. On the view point of consumers, there will be no disconnect and breakdown etc. In this study, a wide factor analyzing is done in order to find the factors that effect the gas consumptions. Found results were applied to ANN feed forward back propagation algorithms. The reasons behind choosing ANN are the ability of forecasting future values of more than one variable at the same time and to model the nonlinear relation in the data structure. Performance comparisons of seven different algorithms were done.","doi":"10.1109/ICADIWT.2008.4664390","pdfPath":"/iel5/4655276/4664315/04664390.pdf","startPage":"448","endPage":"453","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 First International Conference on the Applications of Digital Information and Web Technologies (ICADIWT)","publicationTitle":"2008 First International Conference on the Applications of Digital Information and Web Technologies (ICADIWT)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICADIWT.2008.4664390","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4664315","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Comparison neural networks models for short term forecasting of natural gas consumption in Istanbul","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4664390/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-6 Aug. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Comparison neural networks models for short term forecasting of natural gas consumption in Istanbul","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"31 October 2008","accessionNumber":"10387074","publicationDate":"Aug. 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4664390/","conferenceDate":"4-6 Aug. 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Comparison neural networks models for short term forecasting of natural gas consumption in Istanbul","confLoc":"Ostrava, Czech Republic","sourcePdf":"SPI-10282008-00075.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065239S","chronDate":"4-6 Aug. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4655276","isNumber":"4664315","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4655276","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"4664315","articleId":"4664390","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":4664420,"authors":[{"name":"Arthur Nieuwoudt","affiliation":["Synopsys, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA, USA","Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Rice University, Houston, TX, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8919/5089871/4664420/4664420-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Arthur Nieuwoudt (S'04-M'08) received the B.S. degree in electrical and computer engineering (with honors) and the B.A. degree in history (with honors) from Rice University, Houston, TX, both in 2003, and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical and computer engineering from Rice University in 2006 and 2009, respectively.","He is currently an R&D Engineer with Synopsys, Inc. in Sunnyvale, CA.

A diverse set of both supervised and unsupervised machine learning methods has been applied over the years to tackle these problems and has significantly contributed to advancing the state-of-the-art of protein structure prediction.

Biomedical engineers have played a central role in the design, integration and evaluation of the cochlear implant system, but the overall success is a result of collaborative work with physiologists, psychologists, physicians, educators, and entrepreneurs. This review presents broad yet in-depth academic and industrial perspectives on the underlying research and ongoing development of cochlear implants. The introduction accounts for major events and advances in cochlear implants, including dynamic interplays among engineers, scientists, physicians, and policy makers. The review takes a system approach to address critical issues in cochlear implant research and development. First, the cochlear implant system design and specifications are laid out. Second, the design goals, principles, and methods of the subsystem components are identified from the external speech processor and radio frequency transmission link to the internal receiver, stimulator and electrode arrays. Third, system integration and functional evaluation are presented with respect to safety, reliability, and challenges facing the present and future cochlear implant designers and users. Finally, issues beyond cochlear implants are discussed to address treatment options for the entire spectrum of hearing impairment as well as to use the cochlear implant as a model to design and evaluate other similar neural prostheses such as vestibular and retinal implants.","doi":"10.1109/RBME.2008.2008250","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4689462","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RBME.2008.2008250","publicationTitle":"IEEE Reviews in Biomedical Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Reviews in Biomedical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/4664312/4689462/04664429.pdf","startPage":"115","endPage":"142","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cochlear Implants: System Design, Integration, and Evaluation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 November 2008","displayDocTitle":"Cochlear Implants: System Design, Integration, and Evaluation","volume":"1","chronOrPublicationDate":"2008","dateOfInsertion":"16 December 2008","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4664429/","publicationDate":"2008","accessionNumber":"10495712","pubMedId":"19946565","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4664429/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cochlear Implants: System Design, Integration, and Evaluation","sourcePdf":"rbme-zeng-2008250.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.346696S","chronDate":"2008","xplore-pub-id":"4664312","isNumber":"4689462","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4664312","citationCount":"428","xplore-issue":"4689462","articleId":"4664429","onlineDate":"05 November 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":4664430,"authors":[{"name":"Jay W.

The microenvironment of a cell is an organized combination of extracellular matrix (ECM), cells, and interstitial fluid that influence cellular phenotype through physical, mechanical, and biochemical mechanisms. Screening can be used to map combinations of cells and microenvironments to phenotypic outcomes in a way that can help develop more predictive in vitro models and to better understand phenotypic mechanisms from a systems biology perspective. This paper examines microenvironmental screening in terms of outcomes and benefits, key elements of the screening process, challenges for implementation, and a possible role for microfluidics as the screening platform. To assess microfluidics for use in microenvironmental screening, examples and categories of micro-scale and microfluidic technology are highlighted. Microfluidic technology shows promise for simultaneous control of multiple parameters of the microenvironment and can provide a base for scaling advanced cell-based experiments into automated high-throughput formats.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Reviews in Biomedical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/4664312/4689462/04664430.pdf","startPage":"75","endPage":"93","publicationTitle":"IEEE Reviews in Biomedical Engineering","doi":"10.1109/RBME.2008.2008241","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RBME.2008.2008241","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4689462","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4664430","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Screening the Cellular Microenvironment: A Role for Microfluidics","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Microfluidics","Biological cells","Cancer","Stem cells","Extracellular","Electrochemical machining","Cells (biology)","In vitro","Biological system modeling","Predictive models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biochemistry","biomechanics","bioMEMS","cancer","cellular transport","microfluidics","molecular biophysics","tissue engineering"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular microenvironment","microfluidics","cell biology","cancer","stem cells","extracellular matrix","interstitial fluid","biomechanics","biochemistry","phenotypic mechanisms","systems biology","microenvironmental screening"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cell biology","cell culture","challenges","extracellular matrix","in vitro models","microchannel","microenvironments","microfluidics","multitiered high-throughput screening","optimization","parameter space","phenotypes","platforms","soluble factors","stem cells"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Animals","Cell Culture Techniques","Cell Culture Techniques","Cellular Microenvironment","Humans","Microfluidic Analytical Techniques","Microfluidic Analytical Techniques","Models, Biological","Systems Biology","Systems Biology"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4664430/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 November 2008","displayDocTitle":"Screening the Cellular Microenvironment: A Role for Microfluidics","volume":"1","htmlLink":"/document/4664430/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2008","accessionNumber":"10495713","pubMedId":"20190880","dateOfInsertion":"16 December 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Screening the Cellular Microenvironment: A Role for Microfluidics","sourcePdf":"rbme-warrick-2008241.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.187353S","chronDate":"2008","xplore-pub-id":"4664312","isNumber":"4689462","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4664312","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"4689462","articleId":"4664430","onlineDate":"05 November 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4664505,"authors":[{"name":"Y.

The first contribution is an empirical study of the optimal bilateral filter parameter selection in image denoising applications. The second contribution is an extension of the bilateral filter: multiresolution bilateral filter, where bilateral filtering is applied to the approximation (low-frequency) subbands of a signal decomposed using a wavelet filter bank. The multiresolution bilateral filter is combined with wavelet thresholding to form a new image denoising framework, which turns out to be very effective in eliminating noise in real noisy images.

In the end, we present a watermarking application using ALCNN and multiscale wavelet.","doi":"10.1109/GRC.2008.4664696","startPage":"552","endPage":"555","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Granular Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4648793/4664626/04664696.pdf","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Granular Computing","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GRC.2008.4664696","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4664626","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive Lagrange constraints neural network under multisensing","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Mathematical model","Equations","Artificial neural networks","Watermarking","Unsupervised learning","Supervised learning","Entropy"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","free energy","Helmholtz equations","image fusion","independent component analysis","learning (artificial intelligence)","Lyapunov methods","matrix inversion","neural nets","statistical distributions","watermarking","wavelet transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive Lagrange constraints neural network","multisensing","independent component analysis","ICA","probability distribution","ensemble a posteriori information","Lyapunov function","Helmholtz freedom energy equation","matrix inversion","computational complexity","watermarking","multiscale wavelet","learning matrix"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4664696/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-28 Aug. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive Lagrange constraints neural network under multisensing","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4664696/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"31 October 2008","conferenceDate":"26-28 Aug. 2008","accessionNumber":"10386618","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive Lagrange constraints neural network under multisensing","confLoc":"Hangzhou","sourcePdf":"SPI-10282008-00070.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.077366S","chronDate":"26-28 Aug. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4648793","isNumber":"4664626","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4648793","xplore-issue":"4664626","articleId":"4664696","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":4664698,"authors":[{"name":"Jianguo Zhou","affiliation":["School of Business Administration, North China Electric Power University, China"],"lastName":"Jianguo Zhou","id":"37087328188"},{"name":"Tao Bai","affiliation":["School of Business Administration, North China Electric Power University, China"],"lastName":"Tao Bai","id":"37087328335"},{"name":"Chao Suo","affiliation":["School of Business Administration, North China Electric Power University, China"],"lastName":"Chao Suo","id":"37087831733"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2512-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2513-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4664698","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":185},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4664698","abstract":"In the analysis of predicting share price based on Support Vector Machine (SVM), the parameters of SVM, c and \u03c3, which its value have important effect on the predicting accuracy, must be predetermined carefully.

Through embedding GA into the cultural algorithm framework, this CGA algorithm constructed the population space and the knowledge space based on genetic algorithm. The two spaces evolved independently, at the same time, the population space continuously transferred the evolving knowledge to the knowledge space, and then the knowledge space to achieve global optimization. Additionally, the proposed CGA-SVM model that can automated to determine the optimal values of SVM parameters was test on the prediction of share price of one listed company in China. Then we compared the accuracies of CGA-SVM with other models (Standard SVM, GA-SVM and GA-BPN). Experimental results showed that CGA-SVM performed the best prediction accuracy and generalization, implying that the hybrid of CGA with traditional SVM can serve as a promising alternative for

applied to achieve the discrimination of ratpsilas behavior by encoding and decoding the ratpsilas motor cortical activity. Firstly, the brain neuronal action potentials during extending and flexing behaviors of ratspsila forearms are recorded. Secondly, the neuronal action potentials are classified based on principal component analysis (PCA) and K-means cluster methods. Thirdly, the firing frequency of each neuron during the behaviors are calculated. Lastly, the neuronal ensembles encoding model is characterized based on RBF. We use the firing frequency as the input of the RBF network, and the RBF network will give the behavior state as its output. When analyzing the encoding of ratspsila extending and flexing behaviors, we get the encoding performance of 93%. The result is better than that of back-propagate (BP) neural network and k-means cluster. Therefore, radial basis function (RBF) network is an effective tool for neuron ensembles encoding.","doi":"10.1109/GRC.2008.4664720","startPage":"172","endPage":"177","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Granular Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4648793/4664626/04664720.pdf","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Granular Computing","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GRC.2008.4664720","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4664626","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis of neuronal ensembles encoding model in invasive brain-computer interface study using Radial-Basis-Function networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Radial basis function networks","Firing","Neurons","Flexible printed circuits","Training","Encoding","Rats"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["backpropagation","bioelectric potentials","brain models","brain-computer interfaces","neural nets","neurophysiology","principal component analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neuronal ensembles encoding model","invasive brain-computer interface study","radial-basis-function networks","rat behavior","motor cortical activity","brain neuronal action potentials","principal component analysis","k-means cluster methods","firing frequency","encoding performance","back-propagate neural network","neuron ensembles encoding"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["RBF","action potential","extending and flexing","neuronal ensembles encoding"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4664720/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-28 Aug. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Analysis of neuronal ensembles encoding model in invasive brain-computer interface study using Radial-Basis-Function networks","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4664720/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"31 October 2008","conferenceDate":"26-28 Aug. 2008","accessionNumber":"10386642","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis of neuronal ensembles encoding model in invasive brain-computer interface study using Radial-Basis-Function networks","confLoc":"Hangzhou","sourcePdf":"SPI-10282008-00094.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.077833S","chronDate":"26-28 Aug. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4648793","isNumber":"4664626","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4648793","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"4664626","articleId":"4664720","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":4664724,"authors":[{"name":"Wei Peng","affiliation":["School of Computer, National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, Hunan, China"],"lastName":"Wei Peng","id":"37272683000"},{"name":"Qingfu Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Computing and Electronic Systems, University of Essex, Colchester, Essex, UK"],"firstName":"Qingfu","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37275872700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2512-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2513-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4664724","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":17,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1088},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optimization","Distance measurement","Heuristic algorithms","Particle swarm optimization","Evolution (biology)","Data structures","Shape"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["evolutionary computation","particle swarm optimisation","search problems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiobjective particle swarm optimization algorithm","continuous optimization problems","heuristic optimization technique","personal best experience","global best experience","global optimal solution searching","decomposition methods","multiobejective evolutionary algorithm"]}],"abstract":"Particle swarm optimization (PSO) is a heuristic optimization technique that uses previous personal best experience and global best experience to search global optimal solutions.

In the first stage, an evolutionary based clustering algorithm is developed to extract an initial fuzzy rule base from the data. Based on this model, a back-propagation algorithm with momentum terms is used to refine the initial fuzzy model. The refined model is then used to seed the initial population of an immune inspired multi-objective optimization algorithm in the third stage to obtain a set of fuzzy models with improved transparency. To tackle the problem of simultaneously optimizing the structure and parameters, a variable length coding scheme is adopted to improve the efficiency of the search.

Finally, we study the performance of ensemble method by using vote fused method and compare performance with bagging and adaboost methods.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-28 Aug. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4664742/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10386664","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4664742/","publicationDate":"Aug. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"31 October 2008","conferenceDate":"26-28 Aug. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Study of ensemble method of classifiers for neural networks based on K-means clustering","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Study of ensemble method of classifiers for neural networks based on K-means clustering","confLoc":"Hangzhou, China","sourcePdf":"SPI-10282008-00116.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047521S","chronDate":"26-28 Aug. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4648793","isNumber":"4664626","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4648793","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4664626","articleId":"4664742","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":4664781,"authors":[{"name":"Zhengjie Duan","affiliation":["College of Mathematics, Physics and Information Engineering, Zhejiang Normal University, ZJNU, Jinhua, China"],"firstName":"Zhengjie","lastName":"Duan","id":"37530487000"},{"name":"Jiong Jia","affiliation":["College of Mathematics, Physics and Information Engineering, Zhejiang Normal University, ZJNU, Jinhua, China"],"firstName":"Jiong","lastName":"Jia","id":"37555570100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2512-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2513-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4664781","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":50},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Artificial neural networks","Neurons","Biological system modeling","Mathematical model","Prediction algorithms","Programming","Training"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["learning (artificial intelligence)","neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["learning algorithm","segment procedure neural network mode","known procedure neural network","stock price prediction"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4664781","abstract":"This paper deals with the application of segment procedure neural network to predict a chosen stock price.

With the introduction of dynamic reconfiguration (a feature than can be found, for instance, in recent Field Programmable Gate Arrays), the design of a reconfigurable communication infrastructure becomes a suitable approach to increase both the flexibility and the adaptability of such a system. These are two of the key features of a communication infrastructure for reconfigurable systems, since usually the designer is not aware of which will be the executing modules and the communication requirements at run-time. This paper introduces and describes a novel reconfigurable communication infrastructure for dynamically reconfigurable architectures. The proposed approach is a tile-based network-on-chip in which the communication layer is completely decoupled from the computational one.

Of note, is the relationship between multi-threading and off-chip memory access. This is shown to reduce performance by up to five times for a decimation case study. From the analysis of architecture trends, a post-fabrication choice of processing pattern is shown to provide up to three times improvement for a negligible area cost. In verification, the system model mimics the performance of sample graphics processors. This is achieved with a run time of only five minutes for a decimation case study with a model setup of eight processing elements and 16 KB cache.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Space exploration","Graphics","Computer architecture","Thermal management","Design engineering","Educational institutions","Multithreading","Pattern analysis","Costs","Bandwidth"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiprocessing systems","reconfigurable architectures"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["systematic design space exploration","customisable multiprocessor architecture","customisable options","parameterisable system model","processing elements","multi-threading","off-chip memory access","graphics processors"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4664847","doi":"10.1109/ICSAMOS.2008.4664847","startPage":"57","endPage":"64","publicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Embedded Computer Systems: Architectures, Modeling, and Simulation","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Embedded Computer Systems: Architectures, Modeling, and Simulation","pdfPath":"/iel5/4658786/4664828/04664847.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4664828","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSAMOS.2008.4664847","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4664847/","displayDocTitle":"Systematic design space exploration for customisable multi-processor architectures","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"21-24 July 2008","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2008","dateOfInsertion":"05 November 2008","accessionNumber":"10391972","htmlLink":"/document/4664847/","conferenceDate":"21-24 July 2008","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Systematic design space exploration for customisable multi-processor architectures","confLoc":"Samos, Greece","sourcePdf":"SPI-10302008-00019.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05429S","chronDate":"21-24 July 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4658786","isNumber":"4664828","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4658786","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4664828","articleId":"4664847","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4664848,"authors":[{"name":"Carlo Galuzzi","affiliation":["Computer Engineering, EEMCS, Delft University of Technnology, Netherlands"],"firstName":"Carlo","lastName":"Galuzzi","id":"37393963400"},{"name":"Dimitris Theodoropoulos","affiliation":["Computer Engineering, EEMCS, Delft University of Technnology, Netherlands"],"firstName":"Dimitris","lastName":"Theodoropoulos","id":"37577142400"},{"name":"Koen Bertels","affiliation":["Computer Engineering, EEMCS, Delft University of Technnology, Netherlands"],"firstName":"Koen","lastName":"Bertels","id":"37284722300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1985-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4664848","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":40},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Clustering methods","MIMO","Hardware","Application software","Kernel","Clustering algorithms","Energy consumption","Computer aided instruction","Integer linear programming","Field programmable gate arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["instruction sets","integer programming","linear programming","MIMO systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["convex disconnected multiple input multiple output instructions","clustering method","instruction-set extensions problem","convex MIMO instructions","integer linear programming"]}],"abstract":"The instruction-set extensions problem has been one of the topics which has became popular over the last years and it entails the addition of a set of new complex instructions to a given instruction-set. In this paper, we present an efficient algorithm for the automatic generation of convex multiple input multiple output instructions (MIMOs). The proposed algorithm is based on a two-step method which generates a coverage of the application with single output clusters of instructions and subsequently generates an optimal set of complex MIMO instructions to implement in hardware through an integer linear programming (ILP) formulation of the instruction selection problem. The proposed approach can be applied directly to large kernels and does not impose limitations neither on the number of inputs and/or outputs, nor on the number of new instructions generated. Our results on four well known kernels show that the extended instruction-set allows to execute applications more efficiently and needing fewer cycles. On average between 50% and 70% of the initial execution cycles can be saved depending on the kernel and the reconfigurable platform addressed.","doi":"10.1109/ICSAMOS.2008.4664848","publicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Embedded Computer Systems: Architectures, Modeling, and Simulation","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Embedded Computer Systems: Architectures, Modeling, and Simulation","pdfPath":"/iel5/4658786/4664828/04664848.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSAMOS.2008.4664848","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4664828","startPage":"65","endPage":"73","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Clustering method for the identification of convex disconnected Multiple Input Multiple Output instructions","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4664848","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Clustering method for the identification of convex disconnected Multiple Input Multiple Output instructions","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-24 July 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4664848/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"21-24 July 2008","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2008","accessionNumber":"10384871","dateOfInsertion":"05 November 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4664848/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Clustering method for the identification of convex disconnected Multiple Input Multiple Output instructions","confLoc":"Samos, Greece","sourcePdf":"SPI-10302008-00020.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066026S","chronDate":"21-24 July 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4658786","isNumber":"4664828","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4658786","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4664828","articleId":"4664848","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4664849,"authors":[{"name":"Michael Glass","affiliation":["Hardware/Software Co-Design, University of Erlangen-Nuremberg, Germany"],"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Glass","id":"37355962600"},{"name":"Martin Lukasiewycz","affiliation":["Hardware/Software Co-Design, University of Erlangen-Nuremberg, Germany"],"firstName":"Martin","lastName":"Lukasiewycz","id":"37391632800"},{"name":"Rolf Wanka","affiliation":["Hardware/Software Co-Design, University of Erlangen-Nuremberg, Germany"],"firstName":"Rolf","lastName":"Wanka","id":"37370313700"},{"name":"Christian Haubelt","affiliation":["Hardware/Software Co-Design, University of Erlangen-Nuremberg, Germany"],"firstName":"Christian","lastName":"Haubelt","id":"37391870400"},{"name":"Jurgen Teich","affiliation":["Hardware/Software Co-Design, University of Erlangen-Nuremberg, Germany"],"firstName":"Jurgen","lastName":"Teich","id":"37276355800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1985-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4664849","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":140},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Routing","Network topology","Embedded system","Computer networks","Encoding","Resource management","Evolutionary computation","Automotive engineering","Aerospace electronics","Decoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["embedded systems","evolutionary computation","Pareto optimisation","telecommunication network routing","telecommunication network topology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiobjective routing","topology optimization","networked embedded systems","multiple design objectives","Pareto optimal solutions","multiobjective evolutionary algorithms"]}],"abstract":"Modern networked embedded system design has to cope with multiple design objectives. One major challenge is the determination of optimal routings with respect to these objectives. Existing automatic optimization approaches carry out a two step optimization: First, they perform a multi-objective topology optimization of the networked embedded system. Then, a multi-objective routing optimization for a subset of Pareto optimal solutions obtained from the first step is performed. In general, this may exclude several globally optimal solutions from the optimization process. To overcome this drawback, a unified approach based on multi-objective evolutionary algorithms is presented that ensures a combined optimization of the topology and routing. Since the system topology is varied within the optimization, the main contribution of this paper contribution is a novel routing technique that always samples feasible paths using a topology independent genetic encoding. This encoding preserves optimized routing information when changing the underlying topology. An experimental evaluation shows the effectiveness of the presented approach.","publicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Embedded Computer Systems: Architectures, Modeling, and Simulation","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Embedded Computer Systems: Architectures, Modeling, and Simulation","pdfPath":"/iel5/4658786/4664828/04664849.pdf","startPage":"74","endPage":"81","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multi-objective routing and topology optimization in networked embedded systems","doi":"10.1109/ICSAMOS.2008.4664849","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4664828","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSAMOS.2008.4664849","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4664849","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4664849/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-24 July 2008","displayDocTitle":"Multi-objective routing and topology optimization in networked embedded systems","dateOfInsertion":"05 November 2008","publicationDate":"July 2008","accessionNumber":"10384872","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"21-24 July 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4664849/","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multi-objective routing and topology optimization in networked embedded systems","confLoc":"Samos, Greece","sourcePdf":"SPI-10302008-00021.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049326S","chronDate":"21-24 July 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4658786","isNumber":"4664828","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4658786","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"4664828","articleId":"4664849","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4664852,"authors":[{"name":"Janne Janhunen","affiliation":["Centre for Wireless Communications, University of Oulu, Finland"],"firstName":"Janne","lastName":"Janhunen","id":"37593856300"},{"name":"Olli Silven","affiliation":["Information Processing Laboratory, University of Oulu, Finland"],"firstName":"Olli","lastName":"Silven","id":"37267339700"},{"name":"Markku Juntti","affiliation":["Centre for Wireless Communications, University of Oulu, Finland"],"firstName":"Markku","lastName":"Juntti","id":"37269762200"},{"name":"Markus Myllyla","affiliation":["Centre for Wireless Communications, University of Oulu, Finland"],"firstName":"Markus","lastName":"Myllyla","id":"37295371400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1985-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4664852","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":218},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Software radio","Detectors","Software algorithms","Signal processing algorithms","Digital signal processors","Hardware","Digital signal processing","MIMO","Throughput","Delay"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","digital signal processing chips","MIMO communication","quadrature amplitude modulation","signal detection","software radio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["software defined radio","K-best list sphere detector algorithm","real-valued signal model","fixed-point digital signal processor","DSP","multiple-input multiple-output antenna system","MIMO","quadrature amplitude modulation","QAM","Sandblaster multithreaded processor","partial Euclidean distance","x86 processor architecture","application-specific instruction set processor","ASIP","transport triggered architecture","data transmission"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4664852","abstract":"In this novel study, a real-valued signal model based on the K-best list sphere detector (LSD) algorithm is implemented to fixed-point digital signal processor (DSP). A 2 times 2 multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) antenna system with 64-quadrature amplitude modulation (64-QAM) is assumed. Our former studies proved that software sorting does not meet the real-time requirements, and, thus, in the current studies we assume a hardware sorter. The chosen list size K=16 is based on the simulation results carried out in MATLAB environment. We implemented the K-best LSD algorithm with Sandblaster multithreaded processor and achieved the throughput of 17.9 Mbps, when the hardware sorter was assumed beside the digital signal processor. This novel study shows that the general-purpose digital signal processor has potential to achieve high throughput, when hardware accelerated sorter is assumed. In the current study, the latency of the control code and partial Euclidean distance (PED) calculations were decreased, but the latency of memory loads and stores are significant. We will also compare results from x86 processor architecture and application-specific instruction set processor (ASIP) implemented by using transport triggered architecture (TTA), in which the same parameters were used. The TTA has benefits compared to DSPs, especially in data transmission.","doi":"10.1109/ICSAMOS.2008.4664852","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSAMOS.2008.4664852","startPage":"100","endPage":"107","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Embedded Computer Systems: Architectures, Modeling, and Simulation","pdfPath":"/iel5/4658786/4664828/04664852.pdf","publicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Embedded Computer Systems: Architectures, Modeling, and Simulation","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4664828","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Software defined radio implementation of K-best list sphere detector algorithm","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"21-24 July 2008","displayDocTitle":"Software defined radio implementation of K-best list sphere detector algorithm","conferenceDate":"21-24 July 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2008","dateOfInsertion":"05 November 2008","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4664852/","accessionNumber":"10384875","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4664852/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Software defined radio implementation of K-best list sphere detector algorithm","confLoc":"Samos, Greece","sourcePdf":"SPI-10302008-00024.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055065S","chronDate":"21-24 July 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4658786","isNumber":"4664828","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4658786","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"4664828","articleId":"4664852","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4664853,"authors":[{"name":"Juho Antikainen","affiliation":["Centre for Wireless Communications, University of Oulu, Finland"],"firstName":"Juho","lastName":"Antikainen","id":"37873305900"},{"name":"Perttu Salmela","affiliation":["Department of Computer Systems, Tampere University of Technology, Finland"],"firstName":"Perttu","lastName":"Salmela","id":"37282665100"},{"name":"Olli Silven","affiliation":["Lnformation Processing Laboratory, University of Oulu, Finland"],"firstName":"Olli","lastName":"Silven","id":"37267339700"},{"name":"Markku Juntti","affiliation":["Centre for Wireless Communications, University of Oulu, Finland"],"firstName":"Markku","lastName":"Juntti","id":"37269762200"},{"name":"Jarmo Takala","affiliation":["Department of Computer Systems, Tampere University of Technology, Finland"],"firstName":"Jarmo","lastName":"Takala","id":"37275700700"},{"name":"Markus Myllyla","affiliation":["Centre for Wireless Communications, University of Oulu, Finland"],"firstName":"Markus","lastName":"Myllyla","id":"37295371400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1985-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4664853","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":141},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Process design","Algorithm design and analysis","Detectors","MIMO","Maximum likelihood detection","Computational complexity","Throughput","Wireless communication","Receiving antennas","Transmitting antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["application specific integrated circuits","channel coding","computational complexity","maximum likelihood estimation","MIMO communication","quadrature amplitude modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fine-grained application-specific instruction set processor","K-best list sphere detector algorithm","wireless communication systems","multiple-input multiple-output","MIMO communications","optimal maximum likelihood detection","computational complexity","maximum a posteriori detection","transport triggered architecture","amplitude modulation transmission scheme","quadrature amplitude modulation transmission scheme"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4664853","doi":"10.1109/ICSAMOS.2008.4664853","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSAMOS.2008.4664853","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4664828","publicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Embedded Computer Systems: Architectures, Modeling, and Simulation","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Embedded Computer Systems: Architectures, Modeling, and Simulation","pdfPath":"/iel5/4658786/4664828/04664853.pdf","startPage":"108","endPage":"115","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fine-grained application-specific instruction set processor design for the K-best list sphere detector algorithm","abstract":"Very high spectral efficiency and data rates are among the goals of future wireless communication systems. A strong candidate for meeting the requirements is the use of multiple antennas at both the transmitter and the receiver, known as multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communications. Sphere detectors have been proposed to be used in MIMO reception to achieve or approximate the optimal maximum likelihood detection with reduced computational complexity. Furthermore, list sphere detectors (LSDs) can be used to approximate the maximum a posteriori detection in channel coded systems. The K-best LSD is a particularly interesting LSD variant with predetermined computational complexity and fixed throughput. In this paper, an application-specific instruction set processor is designed for the K-best LSD using transport triggered architecture. 2 \u00d7 2 64-level quadrature amplitude modulation transmission scheme with 16-bit arithmetic and a list size of 16 is used as a baseline design target. List size and word length simulations are presented to justify the choices. The designed processor has a significant amount of general-purpose properties, and it reaches a detection throughput of 7.6 Mbps with a hardware complexity of only 25 000 gate equivalents.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4664853/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-24 July 2008","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"21-24 July 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4664853/","dateOfInsertion":"05 November 2008","publicationDate":"July 2008","accessionNumber":"10384876","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Fine-grained application-specific instruction set processor design for the K-best list sphere detector algorithm","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fine-grained application-specific instruction set processor design for the K-best list sphere detector algorithm","confLoc":"Samos, Greece","sourcePdf":"SPI-10302008-00025.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056433S","chronDate":"21-24 July 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4658786","isNumber":"4664828","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4658786","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"4664828","articleId":"4664853","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4664858,"authors":[{"name":"Gianluca Palermo","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Elettronica e Informazione, Politecnico di Milano, Milan, Italy"],"firstName":"Gianluca","lastName":"Palermo","id":"37391879400"},{"name":"Cristina Silvano","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Elettronica e Informazione, Politecnico di Milano, Milan, Italy"],"firstName":"Cristina","lastName":"Silvano","id":"37295776300"},{"name":"Vittorio Zaccaria","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Elettronica e Informazione, Politecnico di Milano, Milan, Italy"],"firstName":"Vittorio","lastName":"Zaccaria","id":"37326028900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1985-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4664858","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":154},"abstract":"Multi-processor system on-chip (MPSoC) architectures are currently designed by using a platform-based approach. In this approach, a wide range of platform parameters must be tuned to find the best trade-offs in terms of the selected figures of merit (such as energy, delay and area). This optimization phase is called design space exploration (DSE) and it generally consists of a multi-objective optimization (MOO) problem. The design space for an MPSoC architecture is too large to be evaluated comprehensively. So far, several heuristic techniques have been proposed to address the MOO problem for MPSoC, but they are characterized by low efficiency to identify the Pareto front. In this paper, an efficient DSE methodology is proposed leveraging traditional Design of Experiments (DoE) and response surface modeling (RSM) techniques. In particular, the DoE phase generates an initial plan of experiments used to create a coarse view of the target design space; a set of RSM techniques are then used to refine the exploration. This process is iteratively repeated until the target criterion (e.g. number of simulations) is satisfied. A set of experimental results are reported to trade-off accuracy and efficiency of the proposed techniques with actual workloads.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Embedded Computer Systems: Architectures, Modeling, and Simulation","pdfPath":"/iel5/4658786/4664828/04664858.pdf","startPage":"150","endPage":"157","publicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Embedded Computer Systems: Architectures, Modeling, and Simulation","doi":"10.1109/ICSAMOS.2008.4664858","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSAMOS.2008.4664858","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4664828","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4664858","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An efficient design space exploration methodology for multiprocessor SoC architectures based on response surface methods","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Design methodology","Space exploration","Response surface methodology","Design optimization","System-on-a-chip","Context modeling","Electronic mail","Delay","Constraint optimization","Time to market"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["design of experiments","logic design","multiprocessing systems","Pareto optimisation","system-on-chip"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["design space exploration methodology","multiprocessor system on-chip architecture","response surface method","MPSoC","multiobjective optimization problem","Pareto optimisation","design-of-experiment"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4664858/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-24 July 2008","displayDocTitle":"An efficient design space exploration methodology for multiprocessor SoC architectures based on response surface methods","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4664858/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2008","accessionNumber":"10384881","dateOfInsertion":"05 November 2008","conferenceDate":"21-24 July 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An efficient design space exploration methodology for multiprocessor SoC architectures based on response surface methods","confLoc":"Samos, Greece","sourcePdf":"SPI-10302008-00030.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064336S","chronDate":"21-24 July 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4658786","isNumber":"4664828","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4658786","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"4664828","articleId":"4664858","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4664903,"authors":[{"name":"F.

In these algorithms, the problem decomposes into several elements and for each element, a sub-population is regarded. These sub-populations evolve separately by considering the way of interactions among them. The general solution is the result of composition of some individuals from the mentioned sub-populations. These algorithms are more similar to the natural evolution and can be run in parallel and therefore, are more efficient. Function optimization problem is one of the examples of distributed problems in which co-evolutionary genetic algorithms can be used appropriately. To solve the problem, at the first step, we should know whether the variables of the problem are dependent or not. In each case, a different approach should be taken. But, sometimes the recognition of variable dependencies is too hard because of the complexity or discreteness of the functions. This paper represents a solution using a combination of co-evolutionary genetic algorithm and learning automata to address this problem. Learning automata are able to learn the dependence (or independence) of variables and choose the appropriate approach for each case. Experimental results show that using learning automata improves the efficiency of co-evolutionary algorithms and make them suitable for the optimization of any function.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-27 Sept. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4664903/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10384693","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4664903/","publicationDate":"Sept. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"05 November 2008","conferenceDate":"26-27 Sept. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Learning automata-based co-evolutionary genetic algorithms for function optimization","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Learning automata-based co-evolutionary genetic algorithms for function optimization","confLoc":"Subotica, Serbia","sourcePdf":"SPI-10292008-00011.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.087219S","chronDate":"26-27 Sept. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4658740","isNumber":"4664892","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4658740","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4664892","articleId":"4664903","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":4664914,"authors":[{"name":"R.

Unlike conventional channel estimation methods, where channel parameters are estimated based on a known or an estimated length, we propose a blind-based method which will jointly classify and estimate only significant channel parameters and the channel length, i.e., parsimonious channel estimates. Firstly, by using only the received signal and userspsila spreading codes, a data model for the channel response is presented. Then, a blind channel estimation method based on eigenvalue value decomposition (EVD), incorporated with a hierarchical minimum description length (MDL) model selection method is used to estimate only the identified significant channel parameters. Simulation results show that, the proposed method is capable of identifying significant channel parameters with high probabilities and at low SNRs. In addition, the system performance based on the identified parameters is enhanced over conventional methods.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE 10th Workshop on Multimedia Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4657303/4665023/04665058.pdf","startPage":"111","endPage":"116","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE 10th Workshop on Multimedia Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/MMSP.2008.4665058","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MMSP.2008.4665058","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4665023","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4665058","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Model selection-based blind channel estimation method for parsimonious MIMO-COFDM systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Channel estimation","Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","Computational modeling","Antenna arrays","Noise","Receivers","Receiving antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","channel estimation","MIMO communication","OFDM modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["model selection","blind channel estimation method","MIMO-COFDM systems","coded orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","multiple receive antennas","eigenvalue value decomposition","hierarchical minimum description length"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4665058/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 Oct. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Model selection-based blind channel estimation method for parsimonious MIMO-COFDM systems","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4665058/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10384433","dateOfInsertion":"05 November 2008","conferenceDate":"8-10 Oct. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Model selection-based blind channel estimation method for parsimonious MIMO-COFDM systems","confLoc":"Cairns, QLD, Australia","sourcePdf":"SPI-10292008-00035.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.119989S","chronDate":"8-10 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4657303","isNumber":"4665023","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4657303","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4665023","articleId":"4665058","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4665077,"authors":[{"name":"Ulrich Engelke","affiliation":["Blekinge Institute of Technology, Ronneby, Sweden"],"firstName":"Ulrich","lastName":"Engelke","id":"37297932600"},{"name":"Hans-Jurgen Zepernick","affiliation":["Blekinge Institute of Technology, Ronneby, Sweden"],"firstName":"Hans-Jurgen","lastName":"Zepernick","id":"37269932400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2294-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2295-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4665077","dbTime":"15 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":50},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multiobjective optimization of multiple scale visual quality processing","abstract":"In this paper, multiobjective optimization is applied to determine the optimal feature weights for a multi-resolution image quality metric.

Previous work has explored the effects of higher-order motion models with standard block sizes on video coding, but the impact on compression efficiency has not been sufficient to see such approaches adopted in mainstream video-compression standards. In this paper, we put forward a new strategy to augment the performance of extended motion models in the perspective of classical block-matching algorithms. To accomplish superior compression, the proposed scheme takes advantage of larger blocks with multi-level partitioning and a higher order elastic motion model. Performance evaluations show that these two features, when combined under a common framework, can significantly outperform the existing techniques including those available in the recent H.264 standard.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE 10th Workshop on Multimedia Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4657303/4665023/04665085.pdf","startPage":"257","endPage":"260","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE 10th Workshop on Multimedia Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/MMSP.2008.4665085","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MMSP.2008.4665085","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4665023","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4665085","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Extended motion compensation using larger blocks and an elastic motion model","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Gain","Rate-distortion","Vectors","Motion estimation","Bit rate","Video coding","Motion compensation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data compression","motion compensation","motion estimation","video coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["extended motion compensation","elastic motion model","video compression efficiency","standard block sizes","video coding","higher-order motion models","classical block matching algorithms","H.264 standard","motion estimation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4665085/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 Oct. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Extended motion compensation using larger blocks and an elastic motion model","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4665085/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10384460","dateOfInsertion":"05 November 2008","conferenceDate":"8-10 Oct. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Extended motion compensation using larger blocks and an elastic motion model","confLoc":"Cairns, QLD, Australia","sourcePdf":"SPI-10292008-00062.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.040851S","chronDate":"8-10 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4657303","isNumber":"4665023","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4657303","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4665023","articleId":"4665085","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4665086,"authors":[{"name":"Jinrong Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering and Information Science, University of Science and Technology, Hefei, China"],"firstName":"Jinrong","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37697620100"},{"name":"Houqiang Li","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering and Information Science, University of Science and Technology, Hefei, China"],"firstName":"Houqiang","lastName":"Li","id":"37293373400"},{"name":"Chang Wen Chen","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering and Information Science, University of Science and Technology, Hefei, China"],"firstName":"Chang Wen","lastName":"Chen","id":"37280734300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2294-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2295-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4665086","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":119},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Markov random fields","Decoding","Pixel","Parity check codes","Image coding","Correlation","Iterative decoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image coding","Markov processes","matrix algebra","parity check codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed image coding","integrated Markov random field modeling","LDPC decoding","image spatial correlation","intraimage correlation","interimage correlation","Gibbs distribution","Gibbs-based Markov model","JPEG codecs"]}],"abstract":"We present in this paper a novel distributed image coding scheme by exploiting image spatial correlation via Markov random field modeling at the decoding end. This allows us to design a simple yet efficient encoder suitable for various energy efficient imaging sensor network applications. The novelty is the integration of LDPC decoding and Markov random field modeling in order to jointly exploit both inter-image and intra-image correlation. The current research aims at improving our previous work in which the Markov model was defined by a state transition probability matrix. In this research, we model the image via a Markov random field described by Gibbs distribution. Both analysis and simulations have been carried out to demonstrate that this Markov model-based approach is able to achieve significant gains over the schemes without Markov modeling. Furthermore, this new Gibbs-based Markov model is less sensitive to correlated noise. Our approach also outperforms a JPEG codec by up to 4 dB even if the interimage correlation is not very high.","doi":"10.1109/MMSP.2008.4665086","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE 10th Workshop on Multimedia Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE 10th Workshop on Multimedia Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4657303/4665023/04665086.pdf","startPage":"261","endPage":"266","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4665023","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MMSP.2008.4665086","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4665086","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Distributed image coding based on integrated Markov random field modeling and LDPC decoding","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4665086/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 Oct. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Distributed image coding based on integrated Markov random field modeling and LDPC decoding","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"10384461","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"05 November 2008","publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","conferenceDate":"8-10 Oct. 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4665086/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distributed image coding based on integrated Markov random field modeling and LDPC decoding","confLoc":"Cairns, QLD, Australia","sourcePdf":"SPI-10292008-00063.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.09686S","chronDate":"8-10 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4657303","isNumber":"4665023","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4657303","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"4665023","articleId":"4665086","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4665095,"authors":[{"name":"Jayanth Nayak","affiliation":["Mayachitra, Inc., CA, USA"],"firstName":"Jayanth","lastName":"Nayak","id":"37283049500"},{"name":"Gagan Rath","affiliation":["INRIA/IRISA, Rennes, France"],"firstName":"Gagan","lastName":"Rath","id":"37267675100"},{"name":"Denis Kubasov","affiliation":["INRIA/IRISA, Rennes, France"],"firstName":"Denis","lastName":"Kubasov","id":"37295294700"},{"name":"Christine Guillemot","affiliation":["INRIA/IRISA, Rennes, France"],"firstName":"Christine","lastName":"Guillemot","id":"37274492200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2294-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2295-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4665095","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":67},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Decoding","Encoding","Quantization","Correlation","Video coding","Gain","Information filters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["approximation theory","data compression","filtering theory","image resolution","rate distortion theory","video coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["spatial prediction","distributed video coding","Wyner-Ziv DPCM","high resolution approximation","optimal prediction filters","DC component compression","rate-distortion gains"]}],"doi":"10.1109/MMSP.2008.4665095","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4665095","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MMSP.2008.4665095","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4665023","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE 10th Workshop on Multimedia Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE 10th Workshop on Multimedia Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4657303/4665023/04665095.pdf","startPage":"311","endPage":"316","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Spatial prediction in distributed video coding using Wyner-Ziv DPCM","abstract":"This paper deals with spatial prediction in Wyner-Ziv video coding.

The CS theory allows a signal to be reconstructed from a small number of its random measurements if the signal is sparse in some space. An attractive property of CS for MDC applications is that the reconstruction error only depends on the number but not on which of the transmitted measurements that are received. By treating each CS measurement as a description, we have a balanced MDC scheme with fine description granularity and low encoding complexity. Another advantage of the new MDC approach is that all signals can be coded the same but decoded in different spaces for better sparse reconstruction.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE 10th Workshop on Multimedia Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4657303/4665023/04665120.pdf","startPage":"445","endPage":"449","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE 10th Workshop on Multimedia Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/MMSP.2008.4665120","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MMSP.2008.4665120","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4665023","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4665120","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A compressive sensing approach of multiple descriptions for network multimedia communication","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image reconstruction","Decoding","Loss measurement","Multimedia communication","Image coding","Encoding","Measurement uncertainty"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["encoding","multimedia communication","signal reconstruction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compressive sensing approach","network multimedia communication","multiple description coding","signal reconstruction","fine description granularity","low encoding complexity"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4665120/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 Oct. 2008","displayDocTitle":"A compressive sensing approach of multiple descriptions for network multimedia communication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4665120/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10384495","dateOfInsertion":"05 November 2008","conferenceDate":"8-10 Oct. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A compressive sensing approach of multiple descriptions for network multimedia communication","confLoc":"Cairns, QLD, Australia","sourcePdf":"SPI-10292008-00097.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057848S","chronDate":"8-10 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4657303","isNumber":"4665023","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4657303","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"4665023","articleId":"4665120","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4665154,"authors":[{"name":"Zhidong Li","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Engineering, University of New South Wales, Kensington, Australia","Program of Making Sense of Data, NAL Lab, NICTA, Kensington, NSW, Australia"],"lastName":"Zhidong Li","id":"37087149365"},{"name":"Jing Chen","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Engineering, University of New South Wales, Kensington, Australia","Program of Making Sense of Data, NAL Lab, NICTA, Kensington, NSW, Australia"],"lastName":"Jing Chen","id":"37087251977"},{"name":"Adrian Chong","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Engineering, University of New South Wales, Australia"],"firstName":"Adrian","lastName":"Chong","id":"37873124500"},{"name":"Zhenghua Yu","affiliation":["Program of Making Sense of Data, NAL Lab, NICTA, Kensington, NSW, Australia"],"lastName":"Zhenghua Yu","id":"37087537264"},{"name":"Nicol N.

However, accuracy and efficiency are always two main challenges with the AAM search. The paper therefore proposed a fast appearance-model based 3D face tracking algorithm to track a face appearance with significant translation, rotation, and scaling activities by using stochastic meta-descent (SMD) optimization scheme to accelerate the appearance model search and to improve the tracking efficiency and accuracy. The proposed algorithm constructs an active face appearance model by using several semantic landmark points extracted from each frame and then processes the appearance model search to approximate the model translating, rotating, and scaling by using the SMD filter to minimize the appearance difference between the current model and the new observation. We compared the results with both a conventional AAM and a Camshift filter and found that our algorithm outperforms both two in terms of efficiency and accuracy in tracking a fast moving, rotating, and scaling face object in a video sequence.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 Oct. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4665154/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10384528","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4665154/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"05 November 2008","conferenceDate":"8-10 Oct. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Using stochastic gradient-descent scheme in appearance model based face tracking","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Using stochastic gradient-descent scheme in appearance model based face tracking","confLoc":"Cairns, Qld","sourcePdf":"SPI-10292008-00131.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057948S","chronDate":"8-10 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4657303","isNumber":"4665023","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4657303","xplore-issue":"4665023","articleId":"4665154","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":4665157,"authors":[{"name":"Antonello Rizzi","affiliation":["INFOG-COM Department, University of Roma La Sapienza, Rome, Italy"],"firstName":"Antonello","lastName":"Rizzi","id":"37273999700"},{"name":"Nicola Maurizio Buccino","affiliation":["INFOG-COM Department, University of Roma La Sapienza, Rome, Italy"],"firstName":"Nicola Maurizio","lastName":"Buccino","id":"38556438400"},{"name":"Massimo Panella","affiliation":["INFOG-COM Department, University of Roma La Sapienza, Rome, Italy"],"firstName":"Massimo","lastName":"Panella","id":"37340006800"},{"name":"Aurelio Uncini","affiliation":["INFOG-COM Department, University of Roma La Sapienza, Rome, Italy"],"firstName":"Aurelio","lastName":"Uncini","id":"37265655000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2294-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2295-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4665157","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":21,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":95},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Classification algorithms","Feature extraction","Training","Histograms","Correlation","Classification tree analysis","Phase change materials"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["audio coding","data compression","genetic algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compressed audio data","musical genre classification","MPEG-1 layer III","rhythmic content","energy content","MPEG decoding","optimization strategy","genetic algorithms"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4665157","abstract":"This paper deals with the musical genre classification problem, starting from a set of features extracted directly from MPEG-1 layer III compressed audio data. The automatic classification of compressed audio signals into a short hierarchy of musical genres is explored. More specifically, three feature sets for representing timbre, rhythmic content and energy content are proposed for a four leafs tree genre hierarchy. The adopted set of features are computed from the spectral information available in the MPEG decoding stage. The performance and relative importance of the proposed approach is investigated by training a classification model using the audio collections proposed in musical genre contests. We also used an optimization strategy based on genetic algorithms. The results are comparable to those obtained by PCM-based musical genre classification systems.","doi":"10.1109/MMSP.2008.4665157","pdfPath":"/iel5/4657303/4665023/04665157.pdf","startPage":"654","endPage":"659","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE 10th Workshop on Multimedia Signal Processing","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE 10th Workshop on Multimedia Signal Processing","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MMSP.2008.4665157","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4665023","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Genre classification of compressed audio data","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4665157/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 Oct. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Genre classification of compressed audio data","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"05 November 2008","accessionNumber":"10384531","publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4665157/","conferenceDate":"8-10 Oct. 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Genre classification of compressed audio data","confLoc":"Cairns, QLD, Australia","sourcePdf":"SPI-10292008-00134.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.163517S","chronDate":"8-10 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4657303","isNumber":"4665023","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4657303","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"4665023","articleId":"4665157","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4665159,"authors":[{"name":"M.

The artifacts introduced by lossy JPEG compression can be seen as an inherent signature for compressed images. In this paper, we propose a new approach to analyse the blocking periodicity by, 1) developing a linearly dependency model of pixel differences, 2) constructing a probability map of each pixelpsilas belonging to this model, and 3) finally extracting a peak window from the Fourier spectrum of the probability map. We will show that, for single and double compressed images, their peakspsila energy distribution behave very differently. We exploit this property and derive statistic features from peak windows to classify whether an image has been tampered by cropping and recompression. Experimental results demonstrate the validity of the proposed approach.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE 10th Workshop on Multimedia Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4657303/4665023/04665184.pdf","startPage":"803","endPage":"808","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE 10th Workshop on Multimedia Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/MMSP.2008.4665184","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MMSP.2008.4665184","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4665023","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4665184","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Image tampering detection by blocking periodicity analysis in JPEG compressed images","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Pixel","Image coding","Transform coding","Estimation","Q factor","Quantization","Feature extraction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data compression","feature extraction","Fourier transforms","image coding","image resolution","object detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image tampering detection","blocking periodicity analysis","JPEG compressed images","linearly dependency model","pixel differences","probability map construction","peak window extraction","Fourier spectrum","peak energy distribution"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4665184/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 Oct. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Image tampering detection by blocking periodicity analysis in JPEG compressed images","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4665184/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10384558","dateOfInsertion":"05 November 2008","conferenceDate":"8-10 Oct. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Image tampering detection by blocking periodicity analysis in JPEG compressed images","confLoc":"Cairns, QLD, Australia","sourcePdf":"SPI-10292008-00161.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067396S","chronDate":"8-10 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4657303","isNumber":"4665023","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4657303","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"4665023","articleId":"4665184","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4665215,"authors":[{"name":"Mahdi Triki","affiliation":["Philips Research Laboratories, Eindhoven, Netherlands"],"firstName":"Mahdi","lastName":"Triki","id":"37293979400"},{"name":"Dirk T.M.

We model a note signal as a periodic signal with (slow) frequency-selective amplitude modulation and global time warping. Time-varying frequency-selective amplitude modulation allows the various harmonics of the periodic signal to decay at different speeds. Time-warping allows for some limited global frequency modulation. The bandlimited variation of the frequency-selective amplitude modulation and of the global time warping gets expressed through a subsampled representation and parametrization of the corresponding signals. Assuming additive white Gaussian noise, a maximum likelihood approach is proposed for the estimation of the model parameters and the optimization is performed in an iterative (cyclic) fashion that leads to a sequence of simple least-squares problems.","doi":"10.1109/MMSP.2008.4665215","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MMSP.2008.4665215","startPage":"972","endPage":"977","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE 10th Workshop on Multimedia Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4657303/4665023/04665215.pdf","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE 10th Workshop on Multimedia Signal Processing","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4665023","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Periodic signal extraction with frequency-selective amplitude modulation and global time-warping for music signal decomposition","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 Oct. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Periodic signal extraction with frequency-selective amplitude modulation and global time-warping for music signal decomposition","conferenceDate":"8-10 Oct. 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"05 November 2008","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4665215/","accessionNumber":"10384589","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4665215/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Periodic signal extraction with frequency-selective amplitude modulation and global time-warping for music signal decomposition","confLoc":"Cairns, QLD, Australia","sourcePdf":"SPI-10292008-00192.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044192S","chronDate":"8-10 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4657303","isNumber":"4665023","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4657303","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4665023","articleId":"4665215","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":4665226,"authors":[{"name":"C.

For AWGN channel, the gain in term of energy per bit to noise ratio Eb/No was improved by about 5 dB when the system used Haar wavelet compared to FFT-OFDM with a cyclic prefix (CP) of 1/4-th the total OFDM symbol period, for the same BER of 0.001. Other members of Daubechies families such as db8, db16 and db32 also outperformed by the gains of 7 dB, 10 dB and 11 dB, respectively, at the same BER. We also considered Daubechies wavelet db32 and FFT-OFDM with a CP of 1/4-th the total OFDM symbol period in the presence of narrowband interference. In terms of Eb/No, DWT-OFDM surpassed FFT-OFDM by 9 dB at 0.02 BER. It is also shown that the DWT-OFDM of Daubechies db8 and db1 outperform FFT-OFDM in Rayleigh fading, both in multipath flat fading and multipath frequency selective fading. The DWT-OFDMpsilas with db8 and Haar outperformed FFT-OFDM by 7 and 2 dB, respectively, at BER of 0.01 in the flat fading channel. In addition, DWT-OFDM and FFT-OFDM showed about the same performance below 10 dB of Eb/No in frequency selective fading. However, the wavelet-based OFDM showed significant improvement of performance at higher than 10 dB of Eb/No.","doi":"10.1109/ATNAC.2007.4665248","publicationTitle":"2007 Australasian Telecommunication Networks and Applications Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 Australasian Telecommunication Networks and Applications Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4658785/4665219/04665248.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ATNAC.2007.4665248","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4665219","startPage":"475","endPage":"479","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance of Fourier-based and wavelet-based OFDM for DVB-T systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4665248","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Performance of Fourier-based and wavelet-based OFDM for DVB-T systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 Dec. 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4665248/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"2-5 Dec. 2007","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2007","accessionNumber":"10384798","dateOfInsertion":"05 November 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4665248/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance of Fourier-based and wavelet-based OFDM for DVB-T systems","confLoc":"Christchurch, New Zealand","sourcePdf":"SPI-10302008-00029.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.039859S","chronDate":"2-5 Dec. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4658785","isNumber":"4665219","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4658785","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"4665219","articleId":"4665248","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4665250,"authors":[{"name":"Fawaz S.

In the propagation-based method, we present a space-time geometrical channel model with hyperbolically distributed scatterers for a macrocell mobile environment. On the other hand, popular mathematical models have been proposed to model the MIMO channel matrix include (i) the Kronecker model (ii) the Virtual Channel Representation Model and (iii) theWeichselberger Model. These models capture physical wave propagation and antenna configuration at both ends representing in a matrix form. This paper compares different analytical models that impose a particular structure on the MIMO channel matrix. The aim of using these models is to reduce the large number of parameters that can be used directly from the full correlation matrix. Furthermore, Four different antenna geometries are considered under different channel environment scenarios, namely uniform linear array, uniform circular array, Hexagon array and star array.","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 Australasian Telecommunication Networks and Applications Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4658785/4665219/04665250.pdf","startPage":"358","endPage":"363","publicationTitle":"2007 Australasian Telecommunication Networks and Applications Conference","doi":"10.1109/ATNAC.2007.4665250","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ATNAC.2007.4665250","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4665219","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4665250","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Spatial correlation in wireless space-time MIMO channels","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Linear antenna arrays","Mathematical model","Antennas and propagation","Geometry","Analytical models","Solid modeling","Scattering parameters","Antenna arrays","Macrocell networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antennas","MIMO communication","space-time codes","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["spatial correlation","wireless space-time channels","MIMO channels","radio channel","propagation-based method","space-time geometrical channel model","hyperbolically distributed scatterers","macrocell mobile environment","Kronecker model","virtual channel representation model","Weichselberger model","full correlation matrix","linear array","uniform circular array","hexagon array","star array"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4665250/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 Dec. 2007","displayDocTitle":"Spatial correlation in wireless space-time MIMO channels","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4665250/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2007","accessionNumber":"10384800","dateOfInsertion":"05 November 2008","conferenceDate":"2-5 Dec. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spatial correlation in wireless space-time MIMO channels","confLoc":"Christchurch, New Zealand","sourcePdf":"SPI-10302008-00031.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061036S","chronDate":"2-5 Dec. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4658785","isNumber":"4665219","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4658785","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4665219","articleId":"4665250","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4665251,"authors":[{"name":"Fawaz S.

It is assumed that there is no line of sight (LOS) between the transmitter and the receiver, and that the scatterers around the mobile station (MS) are arranged in a circular way. The temporal autocorrelation function (ACF) and spatial cross-correlation function (CCF) are presented, and the model is examined under different mobile environments, physical parameters (such as the scattererspsila distribution), and system parameters (such as the antenna spacing).

Multi carrier modulation schemes like orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) and single carrier schemes like single carrier block transmission (SCBT) are being considered. It has been reported that OFDM systems are susceptible to poor performance in high phase noise environments. Unfortunately because implementations of millimetre-wave systems on current CMOS processes require active devices to operate at a significant fraction of the device transit frequency, high levels of phase noise are produced.

Our results show that the optimized turbo equalizer can approach the information capacity limit to within 0.7 dB. We also optimize the turbo equalizer in terms of the minimum number of required turbo decoding iterations. Our results show that a turbo decoder within a turbo equalization loop requires only a small number of iterations.

The main measure of performance was quality of the received video at a given buffer size, as cellphones have memory of limited capacity. The hypothesis was that SCTP would be able to improve the quality of streamed video over UDP under the same memory requirements. The study involved a series of simulation experiments and measurements in a testbed on the Telecom NZ CDMA2000 network, to test the performance of video streaming under SCTP and under UDP. It was found that SCTP did not improve the quality in streamed video with up to 5 second buffers. While it was known that in case of high packet loss or congestion SCTP could improve the quality, the CDMA2000 network does not suffer from the impairments that SCTP could neutralise, and because of that, in this scenario, the quality of video streaming under SCTP and UDP are similar. The added complexity of SCTP also makes it less suitable for embedded systems.","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 Australasian Telecommunication Networks and Applications Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4658785/4665219/04665304.pdf","startPage":"496","endPage":"502","publicationTitle":"2007 Australasian Telecommunication Networks and Applications Conference","doi":"10.1109/ATNAC.2007.4665304","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ATNAC.2007.4665304","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4665219","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4665304","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Suitability of SCTP for high quality video streaming over CDMA2000","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Streaming media","Video on demand","Bit rate","ISO standards","MPEG 4 Standard","Cellular phones","Transport protocols","Telecommunication computing","Internet","Access protocols"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["3G mobile communication","cellular radio","mobile handsets","transport protocols","video streaming"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["SCTP","stream control transfer protocol","high quality video streaming","CDMA2000 cellphone","data wireless networks","UDP"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4665304/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 Dec. 2007","displayDocTitle":"Suitability of SCTP for high quality video streaming over CDMA2000","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4665304/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2007","accessionNumber":"10384853","dateOfInsertion":"05 November 2008","conferenceDate":"2-5 Dec. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Suitability of SCTP for high quality video streaming over CDMA2000","confLoc":"Christchurch, New Zealand","sourcePdf":"SPI-10302008-00085.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073063S","chronDate":"2-5 Dec. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4658785","isNumber":"4665219","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4658785","xplore-issue":"4665219","articleId":"4665304","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4665323,"authors":[{"name":"Davar Pishva","affiliation":["Carnegie Mellon CyLab Japan, Kobe, Japan"],"firstName":"Davar","lastName":"Pishva","id":"37300232200"},{"name":"Keiji Takeda","affiliation":["Carnegie Mellon CyLab Japan, Kobe, Japan"],"firstName":"Keiji","lastName":"Takeda","id":"37287024900"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0885-8985"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-959X"}],"articleNumber":"4665323","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":15,"citationCountPatent":3,"totalDownloads":1079},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Smart homes","Home appliances","Consumer electronics","Internet","Joining processes","Information security","IP networks","Ovens","Refrigerators","Home computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["domestic appliances","home automation","Internet","security of data"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["networked smart home appliance","product-based security model","Internet","electronic appliance"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4665323","doi":"10.1109/MAES.2008.4665323","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MAES.2008.4665323","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4664827","publicationTitle":"IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel5/62/4664827/04665323.pdf","startPage":"32","endPage":"41","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Product-based security model for smart home appliances","abstract":"The idea of using existing electronics in smart home appliances and connecting them to the Internet is a new dimension along which technologies continue to grow.

In compression, wavelets have shown a good adaptability to a wide range of data, while being of reasonable complexity. Some wavelet-based compression algorithms have been successfully used for some hyperspectral space missions. This paper focuses on the optimization of a full wavelet compression system for hyperspectral images. Each step of the compression algorithm is studied and optimized. First, an algorithm to find the optimal 3-D wavelet decomposition in a rate-distortion sense is defined. Then, it is shown that a specific fixed decomposition has almost the same performance, while being more useful in terms of complexity issues. It is shown that this decomposition significantly improves the classical isotropic decomposition. One of the most useful properties of this fixed decomposition is that it allows the use of zero tree algorithms. Various tree structures, creating a relationship between coefficients, are compared. Two efficient compression methods based on zerotree coding (EZW and SPIHT) are adapted on this near-optimal decomposition with the best tree structure found. Performances are compared with the adaptation of JPEG 2000 for hyperspectral images on six different areas presenting different statistical properties.","doi":"10.1109/TIP.2008.2005824","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/83/4664612/04665334.pdf","startPage":"2334","endPage":"2346","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIP.2008.2005824","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4664612","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hyperspectral Image Compression: Adapting SPIHT and EZW to Anisotropic 3-D Wavelet Coding","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4665334","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 November 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4665334/","displayDocTitle":"Hyperspectral Image Compression: Adapting SPIHT and EZW to Anisotropic 3-D Wavelet Coding","volume":"17","issue":"12","publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","accessionNumber":"10312223","pubMedId":"19004706","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4665334/","dateOfInsertion":"11 November 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hyperspectral Image Compression: Adapting SPIHT and EZW to Anisotropic 3-D Wavelet Coding","sourcePdf":"17tip11-echristophe-2005824.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.097254S","chronDate":"Dec.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"83","isNumber":"4664612","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"72","xplore-issue":"4664612","articleId":"4665334","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4665336,"authors":[{"name":"Kuo-Liang Chung","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, National Taiwan University of Science and Technology, Taipei, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/83/4664612/4665336/4665336-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Kuo-Liang Chung (SM'01) received the B.S., M.S., and Ph.D. degrees in computer science and information engineering from the National Taiwan University, Taiwan, R.O.C., in 1982, 1984, and 1990, respectively.","He was a visiting scholar at the University of Washington, Seattle, in the summer of 1999.

The resource-allocation algorithm assumes a delay-centric approach in that it maximizes resource utilization of the overall system while minimizing the packet delay. The real-time (RT) working capability of HNN hardware implementation means that a very powerful scheduling DRA algorithm can be obtained. A generic formulation of the algorithm is presented to establish the optimal bit rate allocation. In addition, some illustrative examples of this formulation are given, considering specific wireless communication systems, such as general packet radio service (GPRS) or universal mobile telecommunications system (UMTS). To be more precise, the performance of the proposed DRA algorithm is evaluated in a realistic UMTS scenario, considering both RT and nonreal-time (NRT) services. To obtain the best resource distribution and fulfill the different quality-of-service (QoS) levels required by RT and NRT services, the new HNN-based delay-centric DRA algorithm is performed twice. Initially, only the RT services are considered, and following this, all the NRT services are taken into account. The results reveal that the proposed DRA algorithm outperforms other reference algorithms in terms of not only average packet delay but the allocated total bit rate as well.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4665393/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 November 2008","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10312135","volume":"57","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/4665393/","publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"11 November 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A Delay-Centric Dynamic Resource Allocation Algorithm for Wireless Communication Systems Based on HNN","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Delay-Centric Dynamic Resource Allocation Algorithm for Wireless Communication Systems Based on HNN","sourcePdf":"57tvt06-calabuig.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.064193S","chronDate":"Nov.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"4665392","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"4665392","articleId":"4665393","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4665446,"authors":[{"name":"C.

At the same time technology to expand radar use to the upper millimeterwave bands becomes available. An experimental radar has been designed and built using the most advanced solid state technology available in this frequency region.

To avoid the interference of complex background, we propose a texture segmentation based anomaly detection algorithm (TBAD). TBAD introduces the Gaussian Markov random field (GMRF) to model the distribution of background pixel values. Through the GMRF model, images are segmented into series of textures. And the conventional RX algorithm is applied on each segmented textures. Since TBAD can utilize both the spatial and the spectrum information of background, it can reduce the interference of complex background. Experiment applied to real image has validated the performance of the new approach.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 33rd International Conference on Infrared, Millimeter and Terahertz Waves","pdfPath":"/iel5/4648126/4665395/04665852.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"2","publicationTitle":"2008 33rd International Conference on Infrared, Millimeter and Terahertz Waves","doi":"10.1109/ICIMW.2008.4665852","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIMW.2008.4665852","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4665395","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4665852","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Texture segmentation based anomaly detection in remote sensing images","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image segmentation","Signal processing algorithms","Anomaly detection","Interference","Hyperspectral imaging","Computational modeling","Feature extraction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Gaussian distribution","image segmentation","image texture","Markov processes","remote sensing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["texture segmentation based anomaly detection","remote sensing images","civil applications","military applications","Gaussian Markov random field","RX algorithm"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4665852/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-19 Sept. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Texture segmentation based anomaly detection in remote sensing images","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4665852/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2008","accessionNumber":"10384390","dateOfInsertion":"05 November 2008","conferenceDate":"15-19 Sept. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Texture segmentation based anomaly detection in remote sensing images","confLoc":"Pasadena, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-10302008-00457.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050338S","chronDate":"15-19 Sept. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4648126","isNumber":"4665395","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4648126","xplore-issue":"4665395","articleId":"4665852","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4665883,"authors":[{"name":"Renato Jos\u00e9 Sassi","affiliation":["Department of Electronic, University of S\u00e3o Paulo, S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil"],"firstName":"Renato Jos\u00e9","lastName":"Sassi","id":"37528424900"},{"name":"Leandro Augusto da Silva","affiliation":["Department of Electronic, University of S\u00e3o Paulo, S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil"],"firstName":"Leandro Augusto da","lastName":"Silva","id":"38278013700"},{"name":"Emilio Del Moral Hernandez","affiliation":["Department of Electronic, University of S\u00e3o Paulo, S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil"],"firstName":"Emilio Del Moral","lastName":"Hernandez","id":"37438512300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-3361-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3219-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1522-4899"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2375-0235"}],"articleNumber":"4665883","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":143},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4665883","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Databases","Rough sets","Data mining","Data engineering","Systems engineering and theory","Artificial neural networks","Prototypes","Neurons","Hybrid power systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data mining","database management systems","marketing data processing","multilayer perceptrons","rough set theory","software architecture"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["marketing database","knowledge discovery databases","MLP neural network","hybrid architecture","rough sets theory","self-organizing maps neural network","data cluster"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Neural Network","Rough Sets","Hybrid Architecture","SOM","MLP","Marketing"]}],"doi":"10.1109/SBRN.2008.26","pdfPath":"/iel5/4665872/4665873/04665883.pdf","publicationTitle":"2008 10th Brazilian Symposium on Neural Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 10th Brazilian Symposium on Neural Networks","startPage":"3","endPage":"8","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4665873","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SBRN.2008.26","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Methodology Using Neural Network to Cluster Validity Discovered from a Marketing Database","abstract":"The databases of real world contains a huge volume of data and among them there are hidden piles of interesting relations that are actually very hard to find out.

When this problem is tackled by humans,the subjectivity on their classification brings another problem: different human classifiers can give different results when working on a set of the same business descriptions. This can cause a serious distortion on the information for the planning and taxation of the governmental administrations on the three levels: County,State and Federal. Furthermore, the number of possible categories considered is very large, more than 1000 in the Brazilian scenario. The large number of categories makes the problem even harder to be solved, as this is also a multi-labeled problem. In this work we compared the multi-label lazy learning technique, Ml-KNN, to our Probabilistic Neural Network approach. Our implementation overcome the Ml-KNN algorithm in four metrics typically used in the literature for multi-label categorization problems.","doi":"10.1109/SBRN.2008.38","startPage":"195","endPage":"200","publicationTitle":"2008 10th Brazilian Symposium on Neural Networks","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SBRN.2008.38","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4665873","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 10th Brazilian Symposium on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/4665872/4665873/04665915.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Using a Probabilistic Neural Network for a Large Multi-label Problem","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4665915/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Using a Probabilistic Neural Network for a Large Multi-label Problem","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4665915/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10384923","publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"05 November 2008","conferenceDate":"26-30 Oct. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-30 Oct. 2008","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Using a Probabilistic Neural Network for a Large Multi-label Problem","confLoc":"Salvador, Brazil","sourcePdf":"3361a195.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049524S","chronDate":"26-30 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4665872","isNumber":"4665873","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4665872","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4665873","articleId":"4665915","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":4665916,"authors":[{"name":"Ricardo B.C.

Although there have existed a lot of algorithms of blind separation, algorithms for blind separation of digital signals or blind separation of finite characters set are still few. What's more, algorithms for estimating the number of source signals in the case don't appear. In this paper, it gives a novel algorithm for BPSK signals' blind separation. First, it can estimate the number of source signals according to the characteristics of sensor signals in no noise and noise circumstance respectively. Finally, the mixture matrix is estimated accurately by using the relations of sensor signals, which is a primary column transformation of the original mixture matrix. They can be corrected by introducing headers in the bit-streams and differently encoding them.

The primitive regression algorithms ignore the sample weights, and consider all samples play an equal role in regression. But this kind of algorithms often loses efficacy when dealing with outliers, since outliers disturb the regression models greatly. For traditional switching regression, sample membership varies with models when sample weights are equal. In this paper, we propose an adaptive sample weighting method for FCM regression, in which sample membership and sample weights are computed simultaneously. Such method can make outlier sample weights as small as possible.

The fuzzy logic, which has been applied broadly in urban intersection signal control, is used for transit vehicle control at Freeway Ramp in this paper. Different from the traditional measure which adjusts signal cycle by lengthening or shortening the green-time, we propose a red-time regulation method to change the cycle time according the waving of road occupancy rate. The variables used to formulate this method is treated as fuzzification, at the same time the corresponding fuzzy set and fuzzy control rules are built, and we use the maximum membership measure to de-fuzzy. We test the efficiency of this fuzzy controller by comparing its resultant queuing delay with that of traditional fixed time control and actuated control with simulation then we draw the conclusion that this fuzzy logic is more efficient than the other type of control strategies.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fuzzy logic","Traffic control","Road vehicles","Fuzzy control","Lighting control","Delay effects","Control systems","Road transportation","Time measurement","Fuzzy sets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fuzzy control","queueing theory","road traffic","traffic control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["road occupancy rate","fuzzy logic","transit signal control","freeway ramp","urban intersection signal control","transit vehicle control","red-time regulation method","fuzzy set","fuzzy control","queuing delay","fixed time control","actuated control"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["transit signal control","express ramp","fuzzy logic","road occupancy rate","red time lengthening"]}],"doi":"10.1109/FSKD.2008.463","publicationTitle":"2008 Fifth International Conference on Fuzzy Systems and Knowledge Discovery","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 Fifth International Conference on Fuzzy Systems and Knowledge Discovery","pdfPath":"/iel5/4665920/4666196/04666321.pdf","startPage":"622","endPage":"626","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4666196","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FSKD.2008.463","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Road Occupancy Rate Based Fuzzy Logic for Transit Signal Control at Freeway Ramp","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4666321","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Road Occupancy Rate Based Fuzzy Logic for Transit Signal Control at Freeway Ramp","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4666321/","isConference":true,"volume":"3","publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4666321/","accessionNumber":"10323381","conferenceDate":"18-20 Oct. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"05 November 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-20 Oct. 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Road Occupancy Rate Based Fuzzy Logic for Transit Signal Control at Freeway Ramp","confLoc":"Jinan, China","sourcePdf":"3305c622.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068576S","chronDate":"18-20 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4665920","isNumber":"4666196","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4665920","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4666196","articleId":"4666321","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4666380,"authors":[{"name":"Hui Liu","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Shanghai Jiaotong University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Hui","lastName":"Liu","id":"37598403000"},{"name":"Xueyin Hu","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Shanghai Jiaotong University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Xueyin","lastName":"Hu","id":"37880698000"},{"name":"Jinglei Zhao","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Shanghai Jiaotong University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Jinglei","lastName":"Zhao","id":"37655789700"},{"name":"Maosheng Zhong","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Shanghai Jiaotong University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Maosheng","lastName":"Zhong","id":"37532484800"},{"name":"Ruzhan Lu","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Shanghai Jiaotong University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Ruzhan","lastName":"Lu","id":"37655369100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3305-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4666380","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":93},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["World Wide Web","Books","Web mining","Delay","Fuzzy systems","Computer science","Knowledge engineering","Heat engines","Motion pictures","Statistical analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Internet","natural language processing","query processing","text analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["complex named-entity","Chinese query","World Wide Web","named-entity recognition","rough segmentation","caching technique"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["named-entity recognition","complex named-entity","web mining"]}],"abstract":"In spite of the heated discussions of traditional named-entities, complex named-entities like movie names and book names are seldom referred in literature.

for chirped microwave pulse compression","abstract":"In this paper, a technique to design and implement a photonic microwave matched filter for chirped microwave pulse compression is presented. To realize matched filtering, the filter should have a spectral response that is matched to that of the input pulse, which is implemented in this paper using a photonic system that consists of an optical single-sideband (SSB) modulator and a fiber Bragg grating (FBG). The FBG is designed to have a spectral response which is transferred to the spectral response of the microwave filter via SSB modulation and heterodyne detection at a high-speed photodetector. A theoretical investigation on the microwave filter design and the chirped microwave pulse compression is developed. Theoretical analysis on the implementation of three different forms of microwave matched filters, including a classical complex matched filter (CMF), a phase-only filter (POF) and a modified inverse filter (MIF), is presented. A comparison between the filters against the performance measures for a linearly chirped microwave signal compression is provided.","doi":"10.1109/MWP.2008.4666631","publicationTitle":"2008 International Topical Meeting on Microwave Photonics jointly held with the 2008 Asia-Pacific Microwave Photonics Conference","startPage":"47","endPage":"50","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MWP.2008.4666631","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4666616","pdfPath":"/iel5/4658739/4666616/04666631.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 International Topical Meeting on Microwave Photonics jointly held with the 2008 Asia-Pacific Microwave Photonics Conference","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Microwave filters","Microwave photonics","Matched filters","Microwave theory and techniques","Chirp","Optical filters","Optical fibers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Bragg gratings","matched filters","microwave filters","microwave photonics","optical fibres","optical modulation","pulse compression"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["photonic microwave matched filters","chirped microwave pulse compression","photonic system","optical single-sideband modulator","fiber Bragg grating","complex matched filter","phase-only filter","modified inverse filter"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Chirped pulse","radar","matched filter","chirped fiber Bragg grating","chromatic dispersion","pulse compression"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Photonic microwave matched filters for chirped microwave pulse compression","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4666631/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4666631/","accessionNumber":"10384614","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"05 November 2008","publicationDate":"Sept. 2008","conferenceDate":"9 Sept.-3 Oct. 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 9 2008-Oct. 3 2008","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Photonic microwave matched filters for chirped microwave pulse compression","confLoc":"Gold Coast, QLD, Australia","sourcePdf":"SPI-10302008-00015.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04121S","chronDate":"Sept. 9 2008-Oct. 3 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4658739","isNumber":"4666616","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4658739","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"4666616","articleId":"4666631","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4666638,"authors":[{"name":"R.

Radio on fiber (RoF) technologies can realize a cost effective universal platform for ubiquitous wireless services. RoF networks can also be extended to radio on free space optics (RoFSO) providing communication links for heterogeneous wireless services where it is not easy or feasible to install optical fiber. In this paper, we present an experimental study on transmission of RF signals over a turbulent FSO channel by using off-the-shelf radio frequency - FSO (RF-FSO) antennas. The performance results show the potential of FSO links for transmission of RF signals and are also used as a benchmark in designing, predicting and evaluating an advanced dense wavelength division multiplexing (DWDM) RoFSO antenna capable of transporting multiple RF signals we are developing. An analytical modeling of the system is also conducted to confirm the suitability of the system and a good result is obtained compared with experimental data under weak turbulence condition.","doi":"10.1109/MWP.2008.4666664","publicationTitle":"2008 International Topical Meeting on Microwave Photonics jointly held with the 2008 Asia-Pacific Microwave Photonics Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 International Topical Meeting on Microwave Photonics jointly held with the 2008 Asia-Pacific Microwave Photonics Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4658739/4666616/04666664.pdf","startPage":"173","endPage":"176","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MWP.2008.4666664","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4666616","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A study on transmission of RF signals over a turbulent free space optical link","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4666664","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 9 2008-Oct. 3 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4666664/","displayDocTitle":"A study on transmission of RF signals over a turbulent free space optical link","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2008","accessionNumber":"10384647","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4666664/","conferenceDate":"9 Sept.-3 Oct. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"05 November 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A study on transmission of RF signals over a turbulent free space optical link","confLoc":"Gold Coast, QLD, Australia","sourcePdf":"SPI-10302008-00048.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070078S","chronDate":"Sept. 9 2008-Oct. 3 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4658739","isNumber":"4666616","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4658739","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"4666616","articleId":"4666664","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4666671,"authors":[{"name":"T.

A direct photonic QPSK modulator was implemented at 60 GHz and used in the system experiments. By combining photonic QPSK modulation and FFE, 7 Gbps data throughput was achieved over a channel bandwidth of less than 2 GHz, representing a bit-rate increase of three times over simple amplitude shift keying (ASK) modulation. The photonic QPSK modulator incorporates frequency doubling, leading to the simplification of the transmitter. In addition, frequency doubling extends the fiber length limit imposed by signal fading due to chromatic dispersion. FFE is simpler to implement and is less computation intensive than, for instance OFDM. Transmission experiments over 2 km of fiber were conducted.","doi":"10.1109/MWP.2008.4666674","publicationTitle":"2008 International Topical Meeting on Microwave Photonics jointly held with the 2008 Asia-Pacific Microwave Photonics Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 International Topical Meeting on Microwave Photonics jointly held with the 2008 Asia-Pacific Microwave Photonics Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4658739/4666616/04666674.pdf","startPage":"213","endPage":"216","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MWP.2008.4666674","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4666616","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Data throughput tripling by Feed-Forward Equalization and photonic QPSK in a 7 Gbps single-carrier RoF link at 60 GHz","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4666674","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 9 2008-Oct. 3 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4666674/","displayDocTitle":"Data throughput tripling by Feed-Forward Equalization and photonic QPSK in a 7 Gbps single-carrier RoF link at 60 GHz","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2008","accessionNumber":"10384657","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4666674/","conferenceDate":"9 Sept.-3 Oct. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"05 November 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Data throughput tripling by Feed-Forward Equalization and photonic QPSK in a 7 Gbps single-carrier RoF link at 60 GHz","confLoc":"Gold Coast, QLD, Australia","sourcePdf":"SPI-10302008-00058.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041268S","chronDate":"Sept. 9 2008-Oct. 3 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4658739","isNumber":"4666616","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4658739","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"4666616","articleId":"4666674","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4666675,"authors":[{"name":"Maria Morant","affiliation":["Fibre-Radio Group in Nanophotonics Technology Centre, Universidad Polit\u00e9cnica de Valencia, Valencia, Spain"],"firstName":"Maria","lastName":"Morant","id":"37315536900"},{"name":"Roberto Llorente","affiliation":["Fibre-Radio Group in Nanophotonics Technology Centre, Universidad Polit\u00e9cnica de Valencia, Valencia, Spain"],"firstName":"Roberto","lastName":"Llorente","id":"37313992500"},{"name":"Joaquin Perez","affiliation":["Fibre-Radio Group in Nanophotonics Technology Centre, Universidad Polit\u00e9cnica de Valencia, Valencia, Spain"],"firstName":"Joaquin","lastName":"Perez","id":"37307179800"},{"name":"Marta Beltran","affiliation":["Fibre-Radio Group in Nanophotonics Technology Centre, Universidad Polit\u00e9cnica de Valencia, Valencia, Spain"],"firstName":"Marta","lastName":"Beltran","id":"37410717400"},{"name":"Javier Marti","affiliation":["Fibre-Radio Group in Nanophotonics Technology Centre, Universidad Polit\u00e9cnica de Valencia, Valencia, Spain"],"firstName":"Javier","lastName":"Marti","id":"37277670500"},{"name":"Tiago Alves","affiliation":["Optical Communications Group of Instituto de Telecomunica\u00e7\u00f5es, Department Elect.

In the case of continuous RF signal, RIN levels as low as -160 dB/Hz, limited by the laser source, are obtained. Moreover, when the RF signal is no more continuous, such as real radar waveforms, we evidence that Raman amplification overcomes erbium-doped-fiber amplification. Improvement of the pulse-to-pulse RF phase stability of 17 dB is observed. This result is attributed to the nature of Raman amplification, which does not involve transient variations of the population inversion across the whole spectral range covered by radar waveforms.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4666702/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 9 2008-Oct. 3 2008","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"9 Sept.-3 Oct. 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4666702/","dateOfInsertion":"05 November 2008","publicationDate":"Sept. 2008","accessionNumber":"10384685","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Why Raman amplification ?","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Why Raman amplification ?","confLoc":"Gold Coast, QLD, Australia","sourcePdf":"SPI-10302008-00086.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046916S","chronDate":"Sept. 9 2008-Oct. 3 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4658739","isNumber":"4666616","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4658739","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4666616","articleId":"4666702","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4666705,"authors":[{"name":"M.

Improved performance compared to the external modulation scheme previously reported is achieved and comparison with the use of a standard electronic up-converter shows only a slight degradation. The direct modulation represents a major improvement in terms of set-up simplicity and improves the efficiency of the conversion process. It does not degrade the phase noise properties of the photonic oscillator. This simple set-up allows as well the distribution (over 50 m) of the 60 GHz radio signal using radio-over-fibre. Transmission of the up-converted signal over 5 m of air does not show any significant degradation.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4666616","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MWP.2008.4666705","publicationTitle":"2008 International Topical Meeting on Microwave Photonics jointly held with the 2008 Asia-Pacific Microwave Photonics Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 International Topical Meeting on Microwave Photonics jointly held with the 2008 Asia-Pacific Microwave Photonics Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4658739/4666616/04666705.pdf","startPage":"333","endPage":"335","doi":"10.1109/MWP.2008.4666705","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"60 GHz radio signal up-conversion and transport using a directly modulated mode-locked laser","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 9 2008-Oct. 3 2008","displayDocTitle":"60 GHz radio signal up-conversion and transport using a directly modulated mode-locked laser","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"9 Sept.-3 Oct. 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4666705/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2008","accessionNumber":"10384688","dateOfInsertion":"05 November 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4666705/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"60 GHz radio signal up-conversion and transport using a directly modulated mode-locked laser","confLoc":"Gold Coast, QLD, Australia","sourcePdf":"SPI-10302008-00089.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.040252S","chronDate":"Sept. 9 2008-Oct. 3 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4658739","isNumber":"4666616","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4658739","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"4666616","articleId":"4666705","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4666712,"authors":[{"name":"Inaki Romero","affiliation":["Dept. of Med.

Efforts to predict the onset of such events are based on feature extraction from the surface ECG. T-wave alternans (TWAs) are considered a marker of abnormal ventricular function that may be associated with ventricular tachycardia (VT) and ventricular fibrillation. A novel TWA detection algorithm utilizing the continuous wavelet transform is described in this paper. Simulated ECGs containing artificial TWA were used to test the algorithm that achieved a sensitivity of 91.40% and a specificity of 94.00%. The algorithm was subsequently used to analyze the ECGs of eight patients prior to the onset of VT. Of these, the algorithm indicated that five patients exhibited TWA prior to the onset of the tachyarrhythmic events, while the remaining three patients did not exhibit identifiable TWA. Healthy individuals were also studied in which one short TWA episode was detected by the algorithm. However, closer visual inspection of the data revealed this to be a likely false positive result.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical

The circuit configuration of the SSB ATL is beneficial to miniaturize the circuit size using the folding technique.

Adopting an implicit update scheme (ADI) frees the time-step size from the Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy time step constraint. We demonstrate further performance gains by parallelizing the algorithm, although the communication overhead between processors is proportional to the area of the domain. In our parallel ADI-BOR-FDTD method each tridiagonal matrix system is solved by a single processor, with the parallel computer architecture being exploited to solve multiple systems at the same time.

Simulation results revealed that the proposed algorithm outperforms the conventional techniques in terms of bit-error rate (BER).","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Letters","pdfPath":"/iel5/97/4418381/04666762.pdf","startPage":"657","endPage":"660","publicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Letters","doi":"10.1109/LSP.2008.2004517","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LSP.2008.2004517","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4418381","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4666762","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Code-Aided Channel Tracking and Frequency Offset-Phase Noise Elimination for Multicarrier Systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Phase noise","Signal processing algorithms","Iterative algorithms","Frequency estimation","Frequency division multiplexing","Maximum likelihood estimation","Bit error rate","Channel estimation","Error correction codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel coding","channel estimation","computational complexity","error statistics","expectation-maximisation algorithm","interference suppression","OFDM modulation","phase noise"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code-aided channel tracking","carrier frequency offset-phase noise elimination","multicarrier systems","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing systems","OFDM systems","low complexity estimator","maximum-likelihood principle","soft information","channel decoder","channel estimates","bit error rate"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Carrier frequency offset","channel tracking","coding","expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm","orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM)","phase noise"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4666762/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 November 2008","displayDocTitle":"Code-Aided Channel Tracking and Frequency Offset-Phase Noise Elimination for Multicarrier Systems","volume":"15","htmlLink":"/document/4666762/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2008","accessionNumber":"10302059","dateOfInsertion":"05 November 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Code-Aided Channel Tracking and Frequency Offset-Phase Noise Elimination for Multicarrier Systems","sourcePdf":"15lsp01-mmarey-2004517.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.063888S","chronDate":"2008","isNumber":"4418381","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"97","citationCount":"12","articleId":"4666762","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Letter","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4666763,"authors":[{"name":"Min-Hung Yeh","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, National I-Lan University, Ilan, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Min-Hung","lastName":"Yeh","id":"37341284700"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1070-9908"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2361"}],"articleNumber":"4666763","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":19,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":261},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.signalprocessingsociety.org"}],"abstract":"The recently developed quaternion Fourier transform (QFT) based on quaternion algebra has been found useful for color image processing and signal analysis.

Part of the reason for this degradation is the feature extraction techniques that use analysis windows which are much shorter than typical room impulse responses. We present a feature extraction technique based on modeling temporal envelopes of the speech signal in narrow subbands using frequency domain linear prediction (FDLP). FDLP provides an all-pole approximation of the Hilbert envelope of the signal obtained by linear prediction on cosine transform of the signal. ASR experiments on speech data degraded with a number of room impulse responses (with varying degrees of distortion) show significant performance improvements for the proposed FDLP features when compared to other robust feature extraction techniques (average relative reduction of 24% in word error rate). Similar improvements are also obtained for far-field data which contain natural reverberation in background noise. These results are achieved without any noticeable degradation in performance for clean speech.","doi":"10.1109/LSP.2008.2002708","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LSP.2008.2002708","startPage":"681","endPage":"684","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Letters","pdfPath":"/iel5/97/4418381/04666765.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Letters","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4418381","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Recognition of Reverberant Speech Using Frequency Domain Linear Prediction","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 November 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"2008","displayDocTitle":"Recognition of Reverberant Speech Using Frequency Domain Linear Prediction","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2008","dateOfInsertion":"05 November 2008","volume":"15","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4666765/","accessionNumber":"10302062","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4666765/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Recognition of Reverberant Speech Using Frequency Domain Linear Prediction","sourcePdf":"15lsp01-sthomas-2002708.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.048705S","chronDate":"2008","xplore-pub-id":"97","isNumber":"4418381","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"97","citationCount":"39","xplore-issue":"4418381","articleId":"4666765","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4666771,"authors":[{"name":"Huaguang Zhang","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Integrated Automation of Process Industry, China Ministry of Education, Northeastern University, Shenyang, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/72/4666767/4666771/4666771-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Huaguang Zhang (SM'04) received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in control engineering from Northeastern Electric Power University, Jilin, China, in 1982 and 1985, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree in thermal power engineering and automation from Southeast University, Nanjing, China, in 1991.","He joined the Department of Automatic Control, Northeastern University, Shenyang, China, in 1992, as a Postdoctoral Fellow.

Simulations for six benchmark test functions show that IPSO remarkably improves the calculation accuracy and has better ability to find the global optimum than that of the standard PSO algorithm.","doi":"10.1109/ICNC.2008.633","startPage":"30","endPage":"34","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 Fourth International Conference on Natural Computation","pdfPath":"/iel5/4666791/4666792/04666805.pdf","publicationTitle":"2008 Fourth International Conference on Natural Computation","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICNC.2008.633","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4666792","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Self-Adaptive Mutation-Particle Swarm Optimization Algorithm","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Particle swarm optimization","Genetic mutations","Convergence","Power system modeling","Computer science","Stochastic processes","Benchmark testing","Accuracy","Evolutionary computation","Maintenance engineering"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["particle swarm optimisation","search problems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["self-adaptive mutation-particle swarm optimization algorithm","convergence factor","diffusion factor","stochastic mutation operators","global search capability","global search strategy"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["PSO","Self-adaptive","stochastic mutation operator","global search capability"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4666805/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-20 Oct. 2008","displayDocTitle":"A Self-Adaptive Mutation-Particle Swarm Optimization Algorithm","isConference":true,"volume":"1","htmlLink":"/document/4666805/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"07 November 2008","conferenceDate":"18-20 Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10398376","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Self-Adaptive Mutation-Particle Swarm Optimization Algorithm","confLoc":"Jinan, China","sourcePdf":"3304a030.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047209S","chronDate":"18-20 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4666791","isNumber":"4666792","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4666791","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"4666792","articleId":"4666805","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4666813,"authors":[{"name":"Yu-an Zhang","affiliation":["University of Miyazaki, Miyazaki, Japan"],"firstName":"Yu-an","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37676463900"},{"name":"Makoto Sakamoto","affiliation":["University of Miyazaki, Miyazaki, Japan"],"firstName":"Makoto","lastName":"Sakamoto","id":"37667509100"},{"name":"Hiroshi Furutani","affiliation":["University of Miyazaki, Miyazaki, Japan"],"firstName":"Hiroshi","lastName":"Furutani","id":"37681787900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3304-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2157-9555"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2157-9563"}],"articleNumber":"4666813","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":664},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4666813","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Genetic mutations","Genetic algorithms","Stochastic processes","Frequency","Markov processes","Equations","Cities and towns","Fluctuations","Numerical simulation","Reliability theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithms","Markov processes","stochastic processes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["population size","mutation rate","genetic algorithm","stochastic schema theory","Wright-Fisher model","Markov processes"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Population Size","Mutation","Markov Chain","Schema Theory"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICNC.2008.345","pdfPath":"/iel5/4666791/4666792/04666813.pdf","publicationTitle":"2008 Fourth International Conference on Natural Computation","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 Fourth International Conference on Natural Computation","startPage":"70","endPage":"75","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4666792","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICNC.2008.345","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Effects of Population Size and Mutation Rate on Results of Genetic Algorithm","abstract":"The study of genetics algorithms (GAs) with finite population size requires the stochastic treatment of evolution.

evolution (DE) is paid wide attention and research in both academic and industrial fields and successfully applied to many real-world optimization problems. In recent years, several multi- objective optimization algorithms based on DE have been proposed to solve multi-objective optimization problems (MOPs). In this paper, a novel extension of DE for MOPs---enhanced strength Pareto differential evolution (ESPDE), is described. The reason why we call it ESPDE is that it borrows the methods of fitness assignment and density estimation used by improved strength pareto evolutionary algorithm (SPEA2), furthermore, an adaptive Gauss mutation (AGM) based on dimension is added in ESPDE to avoid premature convergence. Simulation results on several difficult test problems and the comparisons with other multi-objective algorithms show that ESPDE is effective and robust.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-20 Oct. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4666837/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10398407","isConference":true,"volume":"1","htmlLink":"/document/4666837/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"07 November 2008","conferenceDate":"18-20 Oct. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Enhanced Strength Pareto Differential Evolution (ESPDE): An Extension of Differential Evolution for Multi-objective Optimization","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Enhanced Strength Pareto Differential Evolution (ESPDE): An Extension of Differential Evolution for Multi-objective Optimization","confLoc":"Jinan, China","sourcePdf":"3304a191.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.08882S","chronDate":"18-20 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4666791","isNumber":"4666792","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4666791","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4666792","articleId":"4666837","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4666850,"authors":[{"name":"Yun Huang","affiliation":["Research Institute of Automation, East China University of Science and Technology, Shanghai, China","Electric Engineering School, Shanghai Dianji University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Yun","lastName":"Huang","id":"37878764400"},{"name":"Yufa Xu","affiliation":["Electric Engineering School, Shanghai Dianji University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Yufa","lastName":"Xu","id":"37066212400"},{"name":"Guochu Chen","affiliation":["Electric Engineering School, Shanghai Dianji University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Guochu","lastName":"Chen","id":"37403714400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3304-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2157-9555"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2157-9563"}],"articleNumber":"4666850","dbTime":"18 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":87},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4666850","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Particle swarm optimization","Humans","Cultural differences","Global communication","History","Acceleration","Automation","Testing","Computational modeling","Organisms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["particle swarm optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["culture-based particle swarm optimization","intelligent optimization algorithm","population space","belief space"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["The Culture-Based Particle Swarm Optimization(CBPSO)","Convergence analysis","Global optimization"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICNC.2008.239","pdfPath":"/iel5/4666791/4666792/04666850.pdf","publicationTitle":"2008 Fourth International Conference on Natural Computation","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 Fourth International Conference on Natural Computation","startPage":"256","endPage":"260","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4666792","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICNC.2008.239","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The Culture-Based Particle Swarm Optimization Algorithm","abstract":"The particle swarm optimization algorithm based on the intelligent optimization algorithm.

Firstly, orthogonal principle is applied to the initialization of particle, so particles are evenly distributed. Secondly, during the evolution, clone and mutation operation based on fitness evaluation is applied to the particle under the concept of immune. Thirdly, because the value of velocity is close to 0 when the particle is in local optimization, the velocity of the particle is also modified after resetting the position according to the simplex principle. It is verified by multidimensional, nonlinear function (Grievank function) in MATLAB. The result shows that the improved PSO can realize global optimization effectively. And in order to analyze the static characteristic of engine effectively, the paper first transforms the nonlinear equations describing engine system characteristics into optimization problem. Then, the improved PSO proposed in the paper is applied to solve the nonlinear and multidimensional problem.

One of these nonlinear problems is the boundary value problem. Most researches focus on the existence of positive solutions with the help of nonlinear analysis tools such as topological indices, critical point theory, etc, and the effective searching of an approximate solution is indeed an interesting problem. While many searching methods focus themselves on particle swarm optimization and genetic algorithms, we propose a new searching algorithm based differential evolution (DE). It proves that DE is a simple optimization algorithm effective for real-valued problems. We present new techniques of finding positive solutions to fourth order boundary value problems.

In this study, we present a hybrid genetic algorithm (LSHGA) for symmetric traveling salesman problem. In the algorithm, a modified local search method based on new neighborhood model was contrived as crossover operation. And a MUT3 operator was introduced as mutation operation. For evading plunge into local extremum, some new ideas are incorporated in our algorithm. The strategy that unites stochastic tournament and elite reservation was used in the process of selection. An idea of reservation ratio was put forward, and the theory of self-adaptive was employed for conforming parameters of LSHGA at the same time. As a result, the population diversity of LSHGA was preserved, and can accomplish convergence quickly. Eight example problems in TSPLIB were showed in the paper to demonstrate the capabilities of the proposed algorithm.","doi":"10.1109/ICNC.2008.235","pdfPath":"/iel5/4666791/4666792/04666929.pdf","startPage":"670","endPage":"674","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 Fourth International Conference on Natural Computation","publicationTitle":"2008 Fourth International Conference on Natural Computation","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICNC.2008.235","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4666792","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Solving TSP with Novel Local Search Heuristic Genetic Algorithms","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4666929/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-20 Oct. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Solving TSP with Novel Local Search Heuristic Genetic Algorithms","isConference":true,"volume":"1","dateOfInsertion":"07 November 2008","accessionNumber":"10398370","publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4666929/","conferenceDate":"18-20 Oct. 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Solving TSP with Novel Local Search Heuristic Genetic Algorithms","confLoc":"Jinan, China","sourcePdf":"3304a670.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042477S","chronDate":"18-20 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4666791","isNumber":"4666792","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4666791","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4666792","articleId":"4666929","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":4666930,"authors":[{"name":"Helei Wu","affiliation":["School of Information Engineering, University of Nanchang, Nanchang, China"],"firstName":"Helei","lastName":"Wu","id":"37279670700"},{"name":"Shuyun Zhu","affiliation":["School of Information Engineering, University of Nanchang, Nanchang, China"],"firstName":"Shuyun","lastName":"Zhu","id":"37881446500"},{"name":"Lingyan Hu","affiliation":["School of Information Engineering, University of Nanchang, Nanchang, China"],"firstName":"Lingyan","lastName":"Hu","id":"37694764200"},{"name":"Qingquan Wang","affiliation":["School of Information Engineering, University of Nanchang, Nanchang, China"],"firstName":"Qingquan","lastName":"Wang","id":"37878445800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3304-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2157-9555"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2157-9563"}],"articleNumber":"4666930","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":39},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4666930","abstract":"It's a complex nonlinear programming problem to find the optimization parameter in the ordering and transporting of steel tube.

Clustering is employed to achieve energy efficiency in battery powered WSNs and facilitate collaborative processing that promises to improve classification accuracy. Since clustering is an NP-hard problem, particle swarm optimization (PSO), a stochastic optimization technique emulating the behavior of a flock of birds, is used to search for the optimal cluster formation.

A case study of biochemical fermentation process shows that the performance of the proposed control scheme is better than that of PI controller.","doi":"10.1109/ICNC.2008.575","pdfPath":"/iel5/4666791/4666936/04667000.pdf","startPage":"276","endPage":"280","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 Fourth International Conference on Natural Computation","publicationTitle":"2008 Fourth International Conference on Natural Computation","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICNC.2008.575","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4666936","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive Model Predictive Control Using Diagonal Recurrent Neural Network","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4667000/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-20 Oct. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive Model Predictive Control Using Diagonal Recurrent Neural Network","isConference":true,"volume":"2","dateOfInsertion":"07 November 2008","accessionNumber":"10398499","publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4667000/","conferenceDate":"18-20 Oct. 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive Model Predictive Control Using Diagonal Recurrent Neural Network","confLoc":"Jinan, China","sourcePdf":"3304b276.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067327S","chronDate":"18-20 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4666791","isNumber":"4666936","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4666791","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4666936","articleId":"4667000","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4667002,"authors":[{"name":"Weixin Gao","affiliation":["Shaanxi Key Laboratory of Oil-Drilling Rigs Controlling Technique, Xian Shiyou University, China"],"firstName":"Weixin","lastName":"Gao","id":"37876457600"},{"name":"Nan Tang","affiliation":["Shaanxi Key Laboratory of Oil-Drilling Rigs Controlling Technique, Xian Shiyou University, China"],"firstName":"Nan","lastName":"Tang","id":"37868923000"},{"name":"Xiangyang Mu","affiliation":["Shaanxi Key Laboratory of Oil-Drilling Rigs Controlling Technique, Xian Shiyou University, China"],"firstName":"Xiangyang","lastName":"Mu","id":"37873513600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3304-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2157-9555"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2157-9563"}],"articleNumber":"4667002","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":256},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hopfield neural networks","Optimization methods","Power generation","Genetic algorithms","Power system planning","Particle swarm optimization","Mathematical model","Computer networks","Laboratories","Power systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithms","Hopfield neural nets","power distribution economics","power engineering computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["unit commitment algorithm","multilayer Hopfield neural network","power system unit commitment","power supply","power demand","genetic algorithm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["unit commitment","Hopfield neural network","optimization","power system","planning"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4667002","abstract":"This paper presents an algorithm, which is based on a Hopfield neural network, for determining unit commitment.

The restricted conditions of the balance between power supply and demand, maximum and minimum outputs of power plants are considered in the energy function.

In the PLC-device controlled manufacturing line, PLC-program holds place of underlying component. It becomes controlling mechanism. The level of automation in the production line relies on control mechanism practiced. In the modern manufacturing, PLC devices can handle whole production line given that structured and smart PLC-program is executed. In other words, PLC-program can manage whole process structure consisting set of procedures. We present a method to monitor PLC-program and PLC error prediction it using neural network. The neural network method being predictive in nature, it rigorously can monitor process signals from sensors, sensed during operation of PLC devices or execution of PLC-program. Subsequently, a neural network algorithm practiced for the analysis of signals. In this way, thorough monitoring of PLC-program can find possible errors from temporal parameters (e.g. Voltage, bias etc). In addition, possible alterations in program and irregularities can be minimized. That can result, easily to use in fault detection, maintenance, and decision support in manufacturing organization. Similarly, it can lessen down-time of machines and prevent possible risks.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-20 Oct. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4667042/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10398522","isConference":true,"volume":"2","htmlLink":"/document/4667042/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"07 November 2008","conferenceDate":"18-20 Oct. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"PLC Control Logic Error Monitoring and Prediction Using Neural Network","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"PLC Control Logic Error Monitoring and Prediction Using Neural Network","confLoc":"Jinan, China","sourcePdf":"3304b484.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062693S","chronDate":"18-20 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4666791","isNumber":"4666936","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4666791","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4666936","articleId":"4667042","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4667043,"authors":[{"name":"Wei You","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical and Electrical Engineering, North China Institute of Science and Technology, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"You","id":"37667466000"},{"name":"Yaxiu Liu","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical and Electrical Engineering, North China Institute of Science and Technology, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yaxiu","lastName":"Liu","id":"37879325700"},{"name":"Bingzhe Bai","affiliation":["Department of Materials Science and Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Bingzhe","lastName":"Bai","id":"37877241300"},{"name":"Hongsheng Fang","affiliation":["Department of Materials Science and Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Hongsheng","lastName":"Fang","id":"37066242800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3304-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2157-9555"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2157-9563"}],"articleNumber":"4667043","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":58},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hydrogen storage","Artificial neural networks","Material storage","Batteries","Materials science and technology","Chemical analysis","Scattering","Neodymium","Chemical technology","Costs"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hydrogen storage","neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["initial discharge capacity","hydrogen storage","artificial neural network"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4667043","abstract":"Back-propagation artificial neural network was developed to predict the initial discharge capacity of AB5-based hydrogen storage alloy.

Because the distribution network is radical, we put forward a method for deciding each node's in-degree by using Hopfield neural network. According to each node's in-degree, it can be easily determined whether the line will be used or not. So the state of switch and the scheme of reconfiguration can be decided correspondingly. The energy function of Hopfield neural network is given in this paper. The problems of satisfying the restriction of radial supplying and minimizing the feeder power looses are considered in the energy function simultaneously. The energy function even takes the problem that some lines may have no switches into consideration. By calculating an IEEE distribution network with three power sources, it can be found that the calculated result of Hopfield neural network is somewhat similar to the result obtained by the more complex genetic algorithm. Since the former is to calculate a group of differential function, so the calculation time needed is comparatively less.","doi":"10.1109/ICNC.2008.147","startPage":"9","endPage":"13","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 Fourth International Conference on Natural Computation","pdfPath":"/iel5/4666791/4667081/04667091.pdf","publicationTitle":"2008 Fourth International Conference on Natural Computation","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICNC.2008.147","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4667081","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Distribution Network Reconfiguration Algorithm Based on Hopfield Neural Network","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hopfield neural networks","Switches","Power supplies","Power system reliability","Voltage","Mathematical model","Artificial intelligence","Equations","Computer networks","Distributed computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distribution networks","genetic algorithms","Hopfield neural nets","power engineering computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distribution network reconfiguration algorithm","Hopfield neural network","target function","complex genetic algorithm","differential function"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Distribution Power Network","Reconfiguration","Hopfield Neural Network"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4667091/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-20 Oct. 2008","displayDocTitle":"A Distribution Network Reconfiguration Algorithm Based on Hopfield Neural Network","isConference":true,"volume":"3","htmlLink":"/document/4667091/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"07 November 2008","conferenceDate":"18-20 Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10398578","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Distribution Network Reconfiguration Algorithm Based on Hopfield Neural Network","confLoc":"Jinan, China","sourcePdf":"3304c009.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.079649S","chronDate":"18-20 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4666791","isNumber":"4667081","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4666791","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"4667081","articleId":"4667091","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4667092,"authors":[{"name":"Xueying Zhang","affiliation":["College of Information Engineering, Taiyuan University of Technology, Taiyuan, China"],"firstName":"Xueying","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37291969300"},{"name":"Peng Wang","affiliation":["College of Information Engineering, Taiyuan University of Technology, Taiyuan, China"],"firstName":"Peng","lastName":"Wang","id":"37280434300"},{"name":"Gaoyun Li","affiliation":["College of Information Engineering, Taiyuan University of Technology, Taiyuan, China"],"firstName":"Gaoyun","lastName":"Li","id":"37578217300"},{"name":"Wenjun Hou","affiliation":["Automation School, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Wenjun","lastName":"Hou","id":"37402519100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3304-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2157-9555"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2157-9563"}],"articleNumber":"4667092","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":150},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4667092","abstract":"There are two problems when conditional T-S fuzzy neural network is used directly in speech recognition system. One is the rule disaster problem, that is, the rule number will increase exponentially with the increase of input dimensions. Another problem is the network reasoning failure resulted from input dimensions too large. The paper presented an improved algorithm of T-S fuzzy neural network. The subtraction clustering algorithm was used to make certain rule number to escape the rule disaster. The network reasoning can correctly work by adding a compensated factor on membership.

The reasons why grey theory is introduced into the RBF neural network are based on two facts. First, the modeling performance will be affected by the randomness inherent in the data when neural network approach is used to the model. That is, poor performance results from large randomness and vice versa. Then, grey accumulated generating operation (AGO), a basis of the grey theory, is reported possessing randomness reduction property. Because of facts, the GRBFN model is presented and expected to have better modeling precision of random drift in dynamically tuned gyroscopes (DTGs). The novel grey RBF network is applied to drift modeling of DTGs. The numerical results of real drift data from a certain type DTG verify the effectiveness of the proposed GRBFN model powerfully. The RBF neural network modeling approach is also investigated to provide a comparison with the GRBFN model. Under identical training condition, the GRBFNpsilas training speed has been enhanced greatly.","doi":"10.1109/ICNC.2008.622","pdfPath":"/iel5/4666791/4667081/04667173.pdf","startPage":"421","endPage":"425","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 Fourth International Conference on Natural Computation","publicationTitle":"2008 Fourth International Conference on Natural Computation","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICNC.2008.622","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4667081","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Novel Grey RBF Neural Network Modeling Method and Its Application","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4667173/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-20 Oct. 2008","displayDocTitle":"A Novel Grey RBF Neural Network Modeling Method and Its Application","isConference":true,"volume":"3","dateOfInsertion":"07 November 2008","accessionNumber":"10398657","publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4667173/","conferenceDate":"18-20 Oct. 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Novel Grey RBF Neural Network Modeling Method and Its Application","confLoc":"Jinan, China","sourcePdf":"3304c421.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042271S","chronDate":"18-20 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4666791","isNumber":"4667081","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4666791","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4667081","articleId":"4667173","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4667178,"authors":[{"name":"Chunling Fan","affiliation":[" College of Automation and Electrical Engineering, Qingdao University of Science and Technology, Qingdao, China"],"firstName":"Chunling","lastName":"Fan","id":"37403774500"},{"name":"Feng Gao","affiliation":[" College of Automation and Electrical Engineering, Qingdao University of Science and Technology, Qingdao, China"],"firstName":"Feng","lastName":"Gao","id":"37875748900"},{"name":"Sitong Sun","affiliation":[" College of Automation and Electrical Engineering, Qingdao University of Science and Technology, Qingdao, China"],"firstName":"Sitong","lastName":"Sun","id":"37878756900"},{"name":"Fengying Cui","affiliation":[" College of Automation and Electrical Engineering, Qingdao University of Science and Technology, Qingdao, China"],"firstName":"Fengying","lastName":"Cui","id":"37410895500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3304-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2157-9555"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2157-9563"}],"articleNumber":"4667178","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":417},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Bayesian methods","Neural networks","Statistical distributions","Predictive models","Probability distribution","Automatic control","Computer networks","Sun","Educational institutions","Automation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Bayes methods","neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Bayesian neural networks","confidence intervals","drift data","predictive precision"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4667178","abstract":"The Bayesian approach provides consistent way to do inference by integrating the evidence from data with prior knowledge from the problem.

Second, the pulse coupled neural network was used to fuse the watermark subimages and the host blocks selected by the contrast sensitivity saliency and the embedding ratio. Finally, the inverse dual tree complex wavelet transform was performed to produce the watermarked image. In the process of extracting the watermark, the obtained watermark subimages were weightily averaged to get a better approximation to the original watermark subimage, and the weight was determined by the embedding ratio. Simulation results will demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4667081","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICNC.2008.573","publicationTitle":"2008 Fourth International Conference on Natural Computation","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 Fourth International Conference on Natural Computation","pdfPath":"/iel5/4666791/4667081/04667203.pdf","startPage":"578","endPage":"582","doi":"10.1109/ICNC.2008.573","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Image Watermarking Based on Dual Tree Complex Wavelet Transform and Pulse Coupled Neural Network","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-20 Oct. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Image Watermarking Based on Dual Tree Complex Wavelet Transform and Pulse Coupled Neural Network","isConference":true,"volume":"3","conferenceDate":"18-20 Oct. 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4667203/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10398552","dateOfInsertion":"07 November 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4667203/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Image Watermarking Based on Dual Tree Complex Wavelet Transform and Pulse Coupled Neural Network","confLoc":"Jinan, China","sourcePdf":"3304c578.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.078251S","chronDate":"18-20 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4666791","isNumber":"4667081","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4666791","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4667081","articleId":"4667203","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":4667208,"authors":[{"name":"Marcos G.

The quantum-behaved particle swarm optimization (QPSO) algorithm, a new particle swarm optimization algorithm which can guarantee the global convergence, was proposed to solve this problem in the paper. The simulation was performed using QPSO algorithm to seek the optimal threshold value of an image adaptively in the two-dimensional gray space, where is the pixel intensity and is the average intensity of the pixel's neighborhood.

On the basis of the matrix, a grey entropy based fitness function is designed for particle swarm optimization (PSO).

The problem of optimizing model parameters is of great interest to the researchers in this area. Genetic algorithm (GA) has been used in the optimization of HMM. However, GA lacks hill-climbing capacity. A novel GA based on Tabu search (TS) called GATS is brought forward, which maintains the merits of GA and TS. Furthermore, combining the Baum-Welch algorithm with the GATS algorithm, a hybrid algorithm named GATSBW is proposed to train the continuous HMM in continuous speech recognition. The GATSBW algorithm not only overcomes the shortcoming of the slow convergence speed of the GATS algorithm but also helps the Baum-Welch algorithm escape from local optimum. The experimental results show that the GATS algorithm has stronger hill-climbing ability than GA and the GATSBW algorithm is superior to the Baum-Welch algorithm in terms of the recognition ability generally.","doi":"10.1109/ICNC.2008.365","pdfPath":"/iel5/4666791/4667228/04667248.pdf","startPage":"57","endPage":"61","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 Fourth International Conference on Natural Computation","publicationTitle":"2008 Fourth International Conference on Natural Computation","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICNC.2008.365","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4667228","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Novel Genetic Algorithm Based on Tabu Search for HMM Optimization","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4667248/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-20 Oct. 2008","displayDocTitle":"A Novel Genetic Algorithm Based on Tabu Search for HMM Optimization","isConference":true,"volume":"4","dateOfInsertion":"07 November 2008","accessionNumber":"10398717","publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4667248/","conferenceDate":"18-20 Oct. 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Novel Genetic Algorithm Based on Tabu Search for HMM Optimization","confLoc":"Jinan, China","sourcePdf":"3304d057.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063343S","chronDate":"18-20 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4666791","isNumber":"4667228","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4666791","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"4667228","articleId":"4667248","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4667262,"authors":[{"name":"Xiuqing Wang","affiliation":["Hebei Normal University, Shijiazhuang, China","Institute of Software, Chinese Academy and Sciences, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Xiuqing","lastName":"Wang","id":"37540087800"},{"name":"Zeng-Guang Hou","affiliation":["Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy and Sciences, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Zeng-Guang","lastName":"Hou","id":"37279945000"},{"name":"Min Tan","affiliation":["Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy and Sciences, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Min","lastName":"Tan","id":"37274596200"},{"name":"Yongji Wang","affiliation":["Institute of Software, Chinese Academy and Sciences, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yongji","lastName":"Wang","id":"37281449000"},{"name":"Xinian Wang","affiliation":["Hebei Normal University, Shijiazhuang, China"],"firstName":"Xinian","lastName":"Wang","id":"37066316100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3304-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2157-9555"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2157-9563"}],"articleNumber":"4667262","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":12,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":100},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Mobile robots","Neurons","Layout","Biological system modeling","Artificial neural networks","Sonar","Robot sensing systems","Robotics and automation","Neural networks","Robustness"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognition","mobile robots","neural nets","pattern classification"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["corridor-scene classification","mobile robot","spiking neurons","cognition","complex environment","real autonomous robot","corridor-scene-classifier","spiking neural networks","integrate-and-fire model","winner-take-all rule"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Mobile robot","Classification","Corridor scene","Spiking Neural Networks"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4667262","abstract":"The ability of cognition and recognition for complex environment is very important for a real autonomous robot.

In this case, standard machine learning algorithms tend to be overwhelmed by the majority class and ignore the minority class since traditional classifiers seeking an accurate performance over a full range of instances.

An optimization relaxation approach based on the analysis of a modified Hopfield neural network is proposed for solving the change detection problem. The modified Hopfield neural network is designed to characterize a texture in terms of spatial-contextual information included in the neighborhood of each pixel within each color plane and interaction between different color planes. The network topology is built on the difference image so that each pixel in the RGB color planes is represented as a node in the network which is connected to its neighborhood units both in its own plane and other two planes. Each node is represented by its state which characterizes the pixel changed or unchanged, and an energy function is derived to represent the overall status of the whole network. Change detection maps are obtained by iteratively updating the output status of the neurons until the network converges. The main contribution of this paper lies in the construction of a novel continuous Hopfield-type neural network on the RGB image for solving the unsupervised image change detection problem. Experiments results obtained on two sets of remote sensing imagery confirm the effectiveness of the proposed approach.","doi":"10.1109/ICNC.2008.456","startPage":"281","endPage":"285","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 Fourth International Conference on Natural

In the bottom layer, parallel optimization calculation is performed on poly-particle swarms. In the top layer, each particle swam in the bottom layer is treated as a particle. The best position found by each particle swarm in the bottom layer is regarded as the best position of single particle of the top layer particle swarm. The result of optimization on the top layer particle swarm is fed back to the bottom layer. Considering the features of distribution network, the probability of producing feasible solutions is improved by modifying the rule of position updating.

When the spread is at 0.01~1.5, bigger errors appear mainly when thermo-EMF is less than 0 V and greater than 75 V. When it is at 0~0.01, the model has high precision and absolute error between simulation temperature and setting temperature is close to 0degC (the mean squared error is 0.00000703~0degC). The results indicate that the model presented has a quick convergent speed in learning process, a higher accuracy and stability within a certain parameter scope.

Five macro economics factors of price level, interest rates, money supply, imports/exports, and productivity, and seven practical technical indicators of fifteen-day and one-day intervals are selected as the input variables of the three sub-networks. The master network then provides the integrated forecasting according to the three sub-networks. To increase forecasting accuracy, a threshold filtering mechanism was applied in this work.

However, the computational complexity of the OMD is exponential, which results that it cannot be applied the practical environments. Though many heuristics have been presented to search for the (near) optimum solutions of this problem, most of them still have higher computational complexity than linear or non-linear detectors because there are many redundant computations in these randomized algorithms. In this paper, we investigate the distribution of the local optima of the OMD problem and propose an efficient heuristic algorithm to find the (near) optimum solution. Simulation results show the bit error rate performance of the proposed algorithm is better than other algorithms and it can produce good solutions rapidly with lower computational complexity.","doi":"10.1109/ICNC.2008.210","publicationTitle":"2008 Fourth International Conference on Natural Computation","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 Fourth International Conference on Natural Computation","pdfPath":"/iel5/4666791/4667376/04667457.pdf","startPage":"362","endPage":"366","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICNC.2008.210","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4667376","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A New Heuristic Method for Multiuser Detection in DS-CDMA Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4667457","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-20 Oct. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4667457/","displayDocTitle":"A New Heuristic Method for Multiuser Detection in DS-CDMA Systems","volume":"5","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10398927","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4667457/","conferenceDate":"18-20 Oct. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"07 November 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A New Heuristic Method for Multiuser Detection in DS-CDMA Systems","confLoc":"Jinan, China","sourcePdf":"3304e362.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057536S","chronDate":"18-20 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4666791","isNumber":"4667376","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4666791","xplore-issue":"4667376","articleId":"4667457","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4667465,"authors":[{"name":"Ran Li","affiliation":["Institute of Command Automation, People''s Liberation Army University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Ran","lastName":"Li","id":"37310663200"},{"name":"Tianzhong Zhao","affiliation":["Institute of Command Automation, People''s Liberation Army University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Tianzhong","lastName":"Zhao","id":"37310228400"},{"name":"Jianjiang Lu","affiliation":["Institute of Command Automation, People''s Liberation Army University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Jianjiang","lastName":"Lu","id":"37278639700"},{"name":"Yafei Zhang","affiliation":["Institute of Command Automation, People''s Liberation Army University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Yafei","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37310452000"},{"name":"Weiguang Xu","affiliation":["Institute of Command Automation, People''s Liberation Army University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Weiguang","lastName":"Xu","id":"37309526700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3304-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2157-9555"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2157-9563"}],"articleNumber":"4667465","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":86},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Genetic algorithms","Image retrieval","Machine learning algorithms","MPEG 7 Standard","Programmable logic arrays","Content based retrieval","Histograms","Radio access networks","Automation","Educational institutions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithms","image classification","learning (artificial intelligence)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["AdaBoost learning","sharing features","genetic algorithm","image annotation","image classification","multimedia content description interface","ensemble classifier","k-nearest neighbor classifier"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Image annotation","Sharing features","AdaBoost","Genetic algorithm"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4667465","abstract":"Image classification approach is one promising technique used for image annotation.

The proposed method has two major components: fuzzy neural network predictor and context based adaptive arithmetic coder. The proposed predictor which is based on T-S fuzzy neural network system effectively exploits structural redundancies between mosaic-like color components, and its residuals are well-modeled by a two-side geometry distribution centered at zero. An advantage of the proposed compression method is the clean separation between prediction and entropy coding of prediction errors. Any entropy coder, be it Huffman or arithmetic, static or adaptive, binary or m-ary, can be easily interfaced with our predictor. Consequently, we can encode mosaic images at low complexity level. Compared with existing methods of lossless compression for Bayer raw data, the performance of proposed method is apparently the best.","doi":"10.1109/ICNC.2008.64","pdfPath":"/iel5/4666791/4667376/04667473.pdf","startPage":"442","endPage":"446","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 Fourth International Conference on Natural Computation","publicationTitle":"2008 Fourth International Conference on Natural Computation","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICNC.2008.64","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4667376","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Application of Fuzzy Neural Network Predictor to Mosaic Image Coding","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4667473/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-20 Oct. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Application of Fuzzy Neural Network Predictor to Mosaic Image Coding","isConference":true,"volume":"5","dateOfInsertion":"07 November 2008","accessionNumber":"10398934","publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4667473/","conferenceDate":"18-20 Oct. 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Application of Fuzzy Neural Network Predictor to Mosaic Image Coding","confLoc":"Jinan, China","sourcePdf":"3304e442.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048336S","chronDate":"18-20 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4666791","isNumber":"4667376","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4666791","xplore-issue":"4667376","articleId":"4667473","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4667475,"authors":[{"name":"Li Jing","affiliation":["ZhengZhou Information Science and Technology Institute, Zhengzhou, China","College of Information, Henan University of Finance and Economics, China"],"firstName":"Li","lastName":"Jing","id":"37875687100"},{"name":"Fenli Liu","affiliation":["ZhengZhou Information Science and Technology Institute, Zhengzhou, China"],"firstName":"Fenli","lastName":"Liu","id":"37308024300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3304-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2157-9555"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2157-9563"}],"articleNumber":"4667475","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":133},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Digital images","Watermarking","Humans","Visual system","Robustness","Fuzzy neural networks","Fuzzy systems","Clustering algorithms","Transform coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["correlation theory","image coding","neural nets","pattern clustering","regression analysis","watermarking"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["general regression neural network","digital image watermarking","human visual system","image local correlation properties","fuzzy c-mean clustering algorithm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["general regression neural network","huzzy c-mean clustering algorithm","watermarking","image processing","local correlation"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4667475","abstract":"Combing the human visual system with the image local correlation properties, a robust digital image watermarking method based on general regression neural network (GRNN) and fuzzy c-mean clustering algorithm (FCM) is proposed.

Experimental results show that the proposed method has better performance than the similar method in countering common image process, such as JPEG compression, noise adding, filtering and so on.","doi":"10.1109/ICNC.2008.175","pdfPath":"/iel5/4666791/4667376/04667475.pdf","startPage":"452","endPage":"456","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 Fourth International Conference on Natural Computation","publicationTitle":"2008 Fourth International Conference on Natural Computation","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICNC.2008.175","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4667376","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Applying General Regression Neural Network in Digital Image Watermarking","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4667475/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-20 Oct. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Applying General Regression Neural Network in Digital Image Watermarking","isConference":true,"volume":"5","dateOfInsertion":"07 November 2008","accessionNumber":"10398936","publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4667475/","conferenceDate":"18-20 Oct. 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Applying General Regression Neural Network in Digital Image Watermarking","confLoc":"Jinan, China","sourcePdf":"3304e452.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051089S","chronDate":"18-20 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4666791","isNumber":"4667376","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4666791","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4667376","articleId":"4667475","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":4667485,"authors":[{"name":"Yong Jin","affiliation":["Institute of Advanced Control and Intelligent Information Processing, Henan University, Kaifeng, China"],"firstName":"Yong","lastName":"Jin","id":"37576232300"},{"name":"Yunzhi Cheng","affiliation":["Institute of Advanced Control and Intelligent Information Processing, Henan University, Kaifeng, China"],"firstName":"Yunzhi","lastName":"Cheng","id":"37879505000"},{"name":"Jie Li","affiliation":["Institute of Advanced Control and Intelligent Information Processing, Henan University, Kaifeng, China"],"firstName":"Jie","lastName":"Li","id":"37879772200"},{"name":"Jianjun Zhao","affiliation":["Institute of Advanced Control and Intelligent Information Processing, Henan University, Kaifeng, China"],"firstName":"Jianjun","lastName":"Zhao","id":"37537640800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3304-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2157-9555"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2157-9563"}],"articleNumber":"4667485","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":65},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4667485","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sampling methods","Direction of arrival estimation","Wideband","Signal processing algorithms","Maximum likelihood estimation","Computational complexity","Computational modeling","Array signal processing","Multiple signal classification","Frequency domain analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","direction-of-arrival estimation","Markov processes","maximum likelihood estimation","Monte Carlo methods","signal sampling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["DOA estimation","short sampling wideband sources","metropolis-hastings sampling","approximated maximum likelihood estimator","computational complexity","Markov Monte Carlo method","spectrum function"]}],"abstract":"Approximated Maximum Likelihood estimator (AML) produces quite accurate DOA estimation of wideband sources with short time sampling. However, this solution is costly due to its high computational complexity. For this reason, Markov Monte Carlo method is combined with Approximated Maximum Likelihood DOA estimator to introduce a computationally efficient algorithm. A novel Approximated Maximum Likelihood DOA Estimator based on Metropolis-Hasting Sampling (MHAML) is proposed. In this method, the power of the AML spectrum function is regarded as the target distribution up to a constant proportionality, and Metropolis-Hasting sampler is used to sample from it.

The framework is applied in numerical examples to compare the performance of different scheduling policies in terms of their efficiency in allocating the wireless resources. This efficiency is measured against the set of all possible operating points of the system, chosen, e.g., by the network operator.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-18 June 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4667578/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"10468950","publicationDate":"June 2008","conferenceDate":"16-18 June 2008","dateOfInsertion":"02 February 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Performance analysis of scheduling policies for delay-tolerant applications in centralized wireless networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance analysis of scheduling policies for delay-tolerant applications in centralized wireless networks","confLoc":"Edinburgh, UK","sourcePdf":"SPI-10302008-00049.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063604S","chronDate":"16-18 June 2008","isNumber":"4667529","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4659193","citationCount":"6","articleId":"4667578","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4667596,"authors":[{"name":"Christian Callegari","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering, University of Pisa, Italy"],"firstName":"Christian","lastName":"Callegari","id":"37542316200"},{"name":"Sandrine Vaton","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, ENST de bretagne, France"],"firstName":"Sandrine","lastName":"Vaton","id":"37268445600"},{"name":"Michele Pagano","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering, University of Pisa, Italy"],"firstName":"Michele","lastName":"Pagano","id":"37287806000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-56555-320-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4667596","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":209},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Intrusion detection","Traffic control","Telecommunication traffic","Electronic mail","Computer security","Internet","Computer science","Information security","IP networks","Face detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Internet","Markov processes","security of data","telecommunication security","telecommunication traffic","transport protocols"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["network anomaly detection","security attacks","Internet","intrusion detection systems","network security","Markovian models","Markov chains","network traffic","TCP"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["statistical techniques.","Intrusion Detection System","High Order Markov Chain","Mixture Transition Model","Non-Homogeneous Markov Chain"]}],"abstract":"In the last few years, the number and impact of security attacks over the Internet have been continuously increasing.

Characterizing the infiltrative nature of lesions with computationally inexpensive and highly efficacious features is crucial for the realization of a computer-aided diagnosis system. In this study, the infiltrative nature is regarded as an energy that produces irregularly and considerably local variances in a 1-D signal. The local variances can be characterized by a few high octave energies (i.e., the channel energies close to low-frequency bands) in a 1-D discrete periodic wavelet transform. For computational cost reduction, high octave decomposition is performed by a reversible round-off 1-D nonrecursive discrete periodic wavelet transform. A test dataset of breast sonograms with the lesion contour delineated by an experienced physician and two inexperienced persons is built for feature efficacy evaluation. High individual performance results imply that the proposed feature is well correlated with the diagnosis of the experienced physician. Experimental results also reveal that with a great performance improvement, the proposed feature is suitable for the combination with some morphometric parameters.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/10/4838904/04667639.pdf","startPage":"880","endPage":"884","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","doi":"10.1109/TBME.2008.2008725","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TBME.2008.2008725","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4838904","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4667639","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Breast Tumor Classification of Ultrasound Images Using a Reversible Round-Off Nonrecursive 1-D Discrete Periodic Wavelet Transform","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Discrete wavelet transforms","Breast tumors","Ultrasonic imaging","Lesions","Cancer","Sonogram","Computer aided diagnosis","Testing","Hospitals","Artificial neural networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biological organs","biomedical ultrasonics","discrete wavelet transforms","gynaecology","image classification","medical image processing","tumours","ultrasonic applications"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["breast tumor classification","ultrasound images","reversible round-off nonrecursive 1-D discrete periodic wavelet transform","malignant breast lesion","computer-aided diagnosis system","infiltrative nature","octave decomposition","breast sonograms","morphometric parameters"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Breast lesion classification","octave energy","reversible round-off 1-D nonrecursive discrete periodic wavelet transform (RRO-NRDPWT)","roughness description"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Breast Neoplasms","Breast Neoplasms","Computer Simulation","Female","Humans","Image Enhancement","Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted","ROC Curve","Reproducibility of Results","Sensitivity and Specificity","Ultrasonography, Mammary"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4667639/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 November 2008","displayDocTitle":"Breast Tumor Classification of Ultrasound Images Using a Reversible Round-Off Nonrecursive 1-D Discrete Periodic Wavelet Transform","volume":"56","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/4667639/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2009","accessionNumber":"10587515","pubMedId":"19272877","dateOfInsertion":"21 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Breast Tumor Classification of Ultrasound Images Using a Reversible Round-Off Nonrecursive 1-D Discrete Periodic Wavelet Transform","sourcePdf":"tbme-lee-2008725.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.097708S","chronDate":"March  2009","xplore-pub-id":"10","isNumber":"4838904","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"4838904","articleId":"4667639","onlineDate":"07 November 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4667645,"authors":[{"name":"Soumyajit Mandal","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), Research Laboratory for Electronics, Cambridge, MA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4156126/4669625/4667645/4667645-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Soumyajit Mandal (S'01) received the B.Tech. degree from the Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur, India, in 2002, and the M.S. degree in electrical engineering from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), Cambridge, in 2004, where he is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree.

An experimental realization of a bidirectional half-duplex link that uses near-field inductive coupling between the implanted system and an external transceiver is described. Our system minimizes power consumption in the implanted system by using impedance modulation to transmit high-bandwidth information in the uplink direction, i.e., from the implanted to the external system. We measured a data rate of 2.8 Mbps at a bit error rate (BER) of <10\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">-6</sup>\n (we could not measure error rates below 10\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">-6</sup>\n ) and a data rate of 4.0 Mbps at a BER of 10\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">-3</sup>\n. Experimental results also demonstrate data transfer rates up to 300 kbps in the opposite, i.e., downlink direction. We also perform a theoretical analysis of the bit error rate performance. An important effect regarding the asymmetry of rising and falling edges that is inherent to impedance modulation is predicted by theory and confirmed by experiment. The link dissipates 2.5 mW in the external system and only 100 muW in the implanted system, making it among the most power-efficient inductive data links reported. Our link is compatible with FCC regulations on radiated emissions.","doi":"10.1109/TBCAS.2008.2005295","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TBCAS.2008.2005295","startPage":"301","endPage":"315","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Circuits and

For ideal single bin processing, it was shown in the literature that at most two unresolved targets can be extracted from the complex matched filter output signal. A new algorithm is developed to jointly detect and track more than two unresolved targets from a single detection with the help of tracking information. That is, the method involves the use of tracking information in the detection process. For this purpose, target states are transformed into detection parameter space, which involves high nonlinearities. In order to handle the nonlinearities, the particle filter, which has proven to be effective in nonlinear non-Gaussian estimation problems, is used as the basis of the closed loop system for tracking multiple unresolved targets. In addition to the standard particle filtering steps, the detection parameters corresponding to the predicted particles are evaluated using the nonlinear monopulse radar beam model. This in turn enables the evaluation of the likelihood of the monopulse signal given tracking data. Bayesian model selection is then used to find the correct detection event. The corresponding particle set is taken as the correct representation of the target posterior. A simulated amplitude comparison monopulse radar is used to generate the data and validate the joint detection and tracking of more than two unresolved targets.","doi":"10.1109/TAES.2008.4667712","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/7/4667706/04667712.pdf","startPage":"1326","endPage":"1341","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAES.2008.4667712","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4667706","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint detection and tracking of unresolved targets with monopulse radar","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4667712","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct.  2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4667712/","displayDocTitle":"Joint detection and tracking of unresolved targets with monopulse radar","volume":"44","issue":"4","publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10476192","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4667712/","dateOfInsertion":"20 February 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint detection and tracking of unresolved targets with monopulse radar","sourcePdf":"44aes04-Nandakumaran.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.120287S","chronDate":"Oct.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"7","isNumber":"4667706","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7","citationCount":"26","xplore-issue":"4667706","articleId":"4667712","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4667720,"authors":[{"name":"Daiyin Zhu","affiliation":["Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7/4667706/4667720/4667720-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Daiyin Zhu (M'05) was born in Wuxi, China, in 1974.

The influence of the hardware implementation on the performance of digital channelized receivers has been analyzed in depth, revealing interesting implementation trade-offs which should be taken into account when designing this kind of signal processing systems on FPGA platforms.","doi":"10.1109/TAES.2008.4667732","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAES.2008.4667732","startPage":"1567","endPage":"1585","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/7/4667706/04667732.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4667706","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Implementing FFT-based digital channelized receivers on FPGA platforms","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4667732/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct.  2008","displayDocTitle":"Implementing FFT-based digital channelized receivers on FPGA platforms","volume":"44","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"20 February 2009","accessionNumber":"10476208","publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4667732/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Implementing FFT-based digital channelized receivers on FPGA platforms","sourcePdf":"44aes04-Sanchez-cr.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.09862S","chronDate":"Oct.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"7","isNumber":"4667706","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7","citationCount":"45","xplore-issue":"4667706","articleId":"4667732","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4667821,"authors":[{"name":"Jianzhuang Wang","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical Science and Engineering, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Hubei, China"],"firstName":"Jianzhuang","lastName":"Wang","id":"37696550500"},{"name":"Youping Chen","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical Science and Engineering, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Hubei, China"],"firstName":"Youping","lastName":"Chen","id":"37539693300"},{"name":"Jingming Xie","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical Science and Engineering, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Hubei, China"],"firstName":"Jingming","lastName":"Xie","id":"37537515900"},{"name":"Bing Chen","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical Science and Engineering, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Hubei, China"],"firstName":"Bing","lastName":"Chen","id":"37559615400"},{"name":"Zude Zhou","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical Science and Engineering, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Hubei, China"],"firstName":"Zude","lastName":"Zhou","id":"37278613900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3304-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2157-9555"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2157-9563"}],"articleNumber":"4667821","dbTime":"41 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":145},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4667821","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Field programmable gate arrays","Neural networks","Three-term control","Sensorless control","Cameras","Velocity measurement","Frequency","Pixel","Arithmetic","Neurofeedback"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["backpropagation","control engineering computing","field programmable gate arrays","neurocontrollers","three-term control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FPGA","PID controller","line-scan camera","sensorless environment","BP neural network","self-training ability","MATLAB"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents a neural network PID controller that enables the usage of the line-scan camera in a sensorless environment.

However, there is still much for revision especially when they are applied in the constrained optimizations, where a mass of memory and computation cost is currently unavoidable. We propose a novel triple spaces cultural algorithm in which a new framework called anti-culture population consisting of individuals disobeying the guidance of culture is added to the traditional dual inheritance cultural algorithm. The effect that the individuals in the anti-culture population disobey culture's guidance is ensured by some mutation operations which make the individuals away from the Culture guided individual in a radiating way. The anti-culture population makes the evolution of both culture and the population faster and at the same time take a lower risk of the local optimization problem. Moreover, with the triple spaces structure and some novel rules to control the convergence process of the algorithm through awarding the most successful individuals and punishing the unsuccessful population, it is possible to deal with a constrained optimization problem with computation burden almost the same as that in solving unconstrained optimization problems. genetic algorithm is utilized as the basis of the population space due to its advantages in representing the structure of the space and convenience in computation. Comparisons with four reported algorithms show that our proposed approach has significant advantages while the cost of computation and storage is much lower.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-20 Oct. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4667904/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10389631","isConference":true,"volume":"6","htmlLink":"/document/4667904/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"07 November 2008","conferenceDate":"18-20 Oct. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Constrained Optimization Using Triple Spaces Cultured Genetic Algorithm","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Constrained Optimization Using Triple Spaces Cultured Genetic Algorithm","confLoc":"Jinan, China","sourcePdf":"3304f589.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06386S","chronDate":"18-20 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4666791","isNumber":"4667783","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4666791","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"4667783","articleId":"4667904","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4667957,"authors":[{"name":"Wenjin Dai","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering, University of Nanchang, China"],"firstName":"Wenjin","lastName":"Dai","id":"37307831800"},{"name":"Yu Wang","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering, University of Nanchang, China"],"firstName":"Yu","lastName":"Wang","id":"37697595000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3304-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2157-9555"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2157-9563"}],"articleNumber":"4667957","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":330},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4667957","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Active filters","Neural networks","Power harmonic filters","Voltage control","Circuits","Control design","Reactive power control","Power system harmonics","Inverters","Adaptive systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["active filters","adaptive control","control system synthesis","neurocontrollers","power factor correction","power filters","power system harmonics","reactive power control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["control design","shunt active power filter","reactive power","unwanted harmonics","voltage source inverter","control circuit","compensation currents","adaptive neural network controller","harmonic components","distorted load current","supply voltage","power factor correction function"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Ative power filter","current control","neural network","harmonics"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICNC.2008.924","pdfPath":"/iel5/4666791/4667925/04667957.pdf","publicationTitle":"2008 Fourth International Conference on Natural Computation","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 Fourth International Conference on Natural Computation","startPage":"124","endPage":"128","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4667925","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICNC.2008.924","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Active Power Filter of Three-Phase Based on Neural Network","abstract":"This paper presents a novel control design of shunt active power filter to compensate reactive power and reduce the unwanted harmonics. A shunt active filter is realized employing three-phase voltage source inverter (VSI) and a control circuit. The shunt active filter acts as a current source, which is connected in parallel with a nonlinear load and controlled to generate the required compensation currents. The control circuit using neural network controller is proposed. One adaptive neural network (ANN) controller is designed to estimate the harmonic components of the distorted load current and supply voltage [1]. A power factor correction function is incorporated in the shunt active filter to achieve a power factor that is near to unity.

In this paper we proposed and evaluated a routing optimization scheme based on graph theory and particle swarm optimization algorithm for multi-hop wireless sensor network.

This requires that the optimization algorithms need to not only find the global optimal solution but also track the trajectory of the changing global best solution in a dynamic environment. To achieve this, this paper proposes a multi-swarm algorithm based on fast particle swarm optimization for dynamic optimization problems. The algorithm employs a mechanism to track multiple peaks by preventing overcrowding at a peak and a fast particle swarm optimization algorithm as a local search method to find the near optimal solutions in a local promising region in the search space. The moving peaks benchmark function is used to test the performance of the proposed algorithm. The numerical experimental results show the efficiency of the proposed algorithm for dynamic optimization problems.","doi":"10.1109/ICNC.2008.313","startPage":"624","endPage":"628","publicationTitle":"2008 Fourth International Conference on Natural Computation","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICNC.2008.313","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4667925","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 Fourth International Conference on Natural Computation","pdfPath":"/iel5/4666791/4667925/04668051.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fast Multi-Swarm Optimization for Dynamic Optimization Problems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4668051/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Fast Multi-Swarm Optimization for Dynamic Optimization Problems","isConference":true,"volume":"7","htmlLink":"/document/4668051/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10393223","publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"07 November 2008","conferenceDate":"18-20 Oct. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-20 Oct. 2008","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fast Multi-Swarm Optimization for Dynamic Optimization Problems","confLoc":"Jinan, China","sourcePdf":"3304g624.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05806S","chronDate":"18-20 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4666791","isNumber":"4667925","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4666791","citationCount":"57","xplore-issue":"4667925","articleId":"4668051","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4668054,"authors":[{"name":"Yinxue Zhang","affiliation":["College of Information Science and Engineering, Xinjiang University, Urumqi, China"],"firstName":"Yinxue","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37879899800"},{"name":"Zhenhong Jia","affiliation":["College of Information Science and Engineering, Xinjiang University, Urumqi, China"],"firstName":"Zhenhong","lastName":"Jia","id":"37669376900"},{"name":"Haijun Jiang","affiliation":["College of Information Science and Engineering, Xinjiang University, Urumqi, China"],"firstName":"Haijun","lastName":"Jiang","id":"37553429700"},{"name":"Zijian Liu","affiliation":["College of Information Science and Engineering, Xinjiang University, Urumqi, China"],"firstName":"Zijian","lastName":"Liu","id":"37875616100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3304-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2157-9555"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2157-9563"}],"articleNumber":"4668054","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":162},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4668054","abstract":"A new method for image restoration based on robust error function and BP neural network optimized with particle swarm optimization (PSO) is proposed in this paper.

The majority of business processes requires human interaction. Human interaction results in a growing complexity of the supporting IT. Model-driven approaches to software development are a promising solution to be able to cope with this complexity. According to these approaches, all aspects of the developed software are captured in models and automatically transformed to the source code of the desired platform. Currently there remains a lack of precise models for capturing necessary aspects of human interaction. Hence, a large amount of manual development and configuration work has to be done to enable humans to perform a task within IT supported business processes.

Simulations are provided to support the mathematical formalism and the convergence of the algorithm.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"19-21 Sept. 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4668189/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"10388195","publicationDate":"Sept. 2007","conferenceDate":"19-21 Sept. 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4668189/","dateOfInsertion":"17 November 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Time domain spectrum allocation using game theory for cognitive radios","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Time domain spectrum allocation using game theory for cognitive radios","confLoc":"Cork, Ireland","sourcePdf":"SPI-10312008-00031.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053274S","chronDate":"19-21 Sept. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4653120","isNumber":"4668158","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4653120","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4668158","articleId":"4668189","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4668277,"authors":[{"name":"Li-Yeh Chuang","affiliation":["Institute of Biotechnology and Chemical Engineering, I-Shou University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Li-Yeh Chuang","id":"37087298133"},{"name":"Sheng-Wei Tsai","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, National Kaohsiung University of Applied Sciences, Kaohsiung, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Sheng-Wei Tsai","id":"37088110069"},{"name":"Cheng-Hong Yang","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, National Kaohsiung University of Applied Sciences, Kaohsiung, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Cheng-Hong Yang","id":"37087307667"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2704-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2705-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4668277","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":11,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":469},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4668277","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Particle swarm optimization","Marine animals","Acceleration","Benchmark testing","Educational institutions","USA Councils","Equations","Iterative algorithms","Genetic mutations","Stochastic processes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["artificial life","convergence","particle swarm optimisation","search problems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["catfish particle swarm optimization","CatfishPSO","optimization algorithm","linearly decreasing weight particle swarm optimization","gbest fitness value","search space","accelerating convergence","benchmark test functions","PSO algorithms"]}],"doi":"10.1109/SIS.2008.4668277","pdfPath":"/iel5/4662551/4668275/04668277.pdf","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Swarm Intelligence Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Swarm Intelligence Symposium","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4668275","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SIS.2008.4668277","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Catfish particle swarm optimization","abstract":"Catfish particle swarm optimization (CatfishPSO) is a novel optimization algorithm proposed in this paper. The mechanism is dependent on the incorporation of a catfish particle into the linearly decreasing weight particle swarm optimization (LDWPSO). The introduced catfish particle improves the performance of LDWPSO. Unlike other ordinary particles, the catfish particles will initialize a new search from the extreme points of the search space when the gbest fitness value (global optimum at each iteration) has not been changed for a given time, which results in further opportunities to find better solutions for the swarm by guiding the whole swarm to promising new regions of the search space, and accelerating convergence. In our experiment, CatfishPSO, LDWPSO and other improved PSO procedures were extensively compared on three benchmark test functions with 10, 20 and 30 different dimensions. Experimental results indicate that CatfishPSO achieves better performance than LDWPSO procedure and other improved PSO algorithms from the literature.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-23 Sept. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4668277/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10393460","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4668277/","publicationDate":"Sept. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"07 November 2008","conferenceDate":"21-23 Sept. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Catfish particle swarm optimization","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Catfish particle swarm optimization","confLoc":"St. Louis, MO, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-11032008-00002.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.096095S","chronDate":"21-23 Sept. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4662551","isNumber":"4668275","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4662551","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"4668275","articleId":"4668277","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":4668281,"authors":[{"name":"James Lane","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Cape Town, South Africa"],"firstName":"James","lastName":"Lane","id":"37873060100"},{"name":"Andries Engelbrecht","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Pretoria, South Africa"],"firstName":"Andries","lastName":"Engelbrecht","id":"37276400500"},{"name":"James Gain","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Cape Town, South Africa"],"firstName":"James","lastName":"Gain","id":"37729860400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2704-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2705-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4668281","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":28,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":219},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Particle swarm optimization","Topology","Birds","Convergence","Computer science","USA Councils","Cities and towns","Africa","Cultural differences","Data structures"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mesh generation","particle swarm optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["particle swarm optimization","Delaunay triangulation","fitness distance ratio approaches"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Delaunay Triangulation","Neighbour Topology","Particle Swarm Optimization","Heuristics"]}],"abstract":"Neighbourhood topologies in particle swarm optimization (PSO) are typically random in terms of the spatial positions of connected neighbours.

BFT is already used for optimization problems, and performance of basic BFT for small problems with moderate dimension and searching space is satisfactory. Search space and complexity grow exponentially in scalable ELD problems, and the basic BFT is not suitable to solve the high dimensional ELD problems, as cells move randomly in basic BFT, and swarming is not sufficiently achieved by cell-to-cell attraction and repelling effects for ELD. However, chemotaxis, swimming, reproduction and elimination-dispersal steps of BFT are very promising. On the other hand, particles move toward promising locations depending on best values from memory and knowledge in particle swarm optimization (PSO). Therefore, best cell (or particle) biased velocity (vector) is added to the random velocity of BFT to reduce randomness in movement (evolution) and to increase swarming in the proposed method to solve ELD. Finally, a data set from a benchmark system is used to show the effectiveness of the proposed method and the results are compared with other methods.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Swarm Intelligence Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/4662551/4668275/04668291.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Swarm Intelligence Symposium","doi":"10.1109/SIS.2008.4668291","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SIS.2008.4668291","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4668275","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4668291","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Economic load dispatch using bacterial foraging technique with particle swarm optimization biased evolution","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Microorganisms","Particle swarm optimization","Power generation economics","Space technology","USA Councils","Power system economics","Optimization methods","Gradient methods","Neural networks","Hopfield neural networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["load dispatching","particle swarm optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["economic load dispatch","modified bacterial foraging technique","particle swarm optimization","scalable ELD problems","high dimensional ELD problems","cell-to-cell attraction","elimination-dispersal steps"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Bacterial foraging technique","particle swarm optimization","economic load dispatch"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4668291/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-23 Sept. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Economic load dispatch using bacterial foraging technique with particle swarm optimization biased evolution","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4668291/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2008","accessionNumber":"10393462","dateOfInsertion":"07 November 2008","conferenceDate":"21-23 Sept. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Economic load dispatch using bacterial foraging technique with particle swarm optimization biased evolution","confLoc":"St. Louis, MO, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-11032008-00016.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.07627S","chronDate":"21-23 Sept. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4662551","isNumber":"4668275","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4662551","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"4668275","articleId":"4668291","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":4668293,"authors":[{"name":"James M.

We then consider why PSO does not do well on this type of problem.","doi":"10.1109/SIS.2008.4668293","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Swarm Intelligence Symposium","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SIS.2008.4668293","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4668275","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Swarm Intelligence Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/4662551/4668275/04668293.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Integer-valued Particle Swarm Optimization applied to Sudoku puzzles","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4668293/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Integer-valued Particle Swarm Optimization applied to Sudoku puzzles","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4668293/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10393463","publicationDate":"Sept. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"07 November 2008","conferenceDate":"21-23 Sept. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-23 Sept. 2008","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Integer-valued Particle Swarm Optimization applied to Sudoku puzzles","confLoc":"St. Louis, MO, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-11032008-00018.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055376S","chronDate":"21-23 Sept. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4662551","isNumber":"4668275","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4662551","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"4668275","articleId":"4668293","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4668294,"authors":[{"name":"Shafiq Alam","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Auckland, Auckland, New Zealand"],"firstName":"Shafiq","lastName":"Alam","id":"37586132800"},{"name":"Gillian Dobbie","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Auckland, Auckland, New Zealand"],"firstName":"Gillian","lastName":"Dobbie","id":"37408794600"},{"name":"Patricia Riddle","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Auckland, Auckland, New Zealand"],"firstName":"Patricia","lastName":"Riddle","id":"37565812900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2704-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2705-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4668294","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":34,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":788},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Particle swarm optimization","Clustering algorithms","Partitioning algorithms","Data mining","Benchmark testing","USA Councils","Computer science","Application software","Bioinformatics","Performance evaluation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data mining","evolutionary computation","particle swarm optimisation","pattern clustering"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data clustering","evolutionary particle swarm optimization algorithm","data mining","swarm generation evolution","iteration method"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4668294","abstract":"Clustering is an important data mining task and has been explored extensively by a number of researchers for different application areas such as finding similarities in images, text data and bio-informatics data. Various optimization techniques have been proposed to improve the performance of clustering algorithms. In this paper we propose a novel algorithm for clustering that we call evolutionary particle swarm optimization (EPSO)-clustering algorithm which is based on PSO. The proposed algorithm is based on the evolution of swarm generations where the particles are initially uniformly distributed in the input data space and after a specified number of iterations; a new generation of the swarm evolves. The swarm tries to dynamically adjust itself after each generation to optimal positions. The paper describes the new algorithm the initial implementation and presents tests performed on real clustering benchmark data. The proposed method is compared with k-means clustering- a benchmark clustering technique and simple particle swarm clustering algorithm. The results show that the algorithm is efficient and produces compact clusters.","doi":"10.1109/SIS.2008.4668294","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Swarm Intelligence Symposium","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SIS.2008.4668294","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4668275","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Swarm Intelligence Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/4662551/4668275/04668294.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Evolutionary Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm for data clustering","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4668294/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"An Evolutionary Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm for data clustering","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4668294/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10393464","publicationDate":"Sept. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"07 November 2008","conferenceDate":"21-23 Sept. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-23 Sept. 2008","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Evolutionary Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm for data clustering","confLoc":"St. Louis, MO, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-11032008-00019.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054608S","chronDate":"21-23 Sept. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4662551","isNumber":"4668275","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4662551","citationCount":"34","xplore-issue":"4668275","articleId":"4668294","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4668298,"authors":[{"name":"S.

Severe resource constraints in MANETs call for energy efficient target localization and collaborative navigation. Centralized control of MANET nodes is not an attractive solution due to its high network utilization that can result in congestions and delays. In nature, many colonies of biological species (such as a flock of birds) can achieve effective collaborative navigation without any centralized control. Particle swarm optimization (PSO), a popular swarm intelligence approach that models social dynamics of a biological swarm is proposed in this paper for network-centric target localization in MANETs that are enhanced by mobile robots. Simulation study of two application scenarios is conducted. While one scenario focuses on quick target localization, the other aims at convergence of MANET nodes around the target. Reduction of swarm size during PSO search is proposed for accelerated convergence. The results of the study show that the proposed algorithm is effective in network-centric collaborative navigation. Emergence of converging behavior of MANET nodes is observed.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-23 Sept. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4668299/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10389997","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4668299/","publicationDate":"Sept. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"07 November 2008","conferenceDate":"21-23 Sept. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Network-centric localization in MANETs based on particle swarm optimization","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Network-centric localization in MANETs based on particle swarm optimization","confLoc":"St. Louis, MO, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-11032008-00024.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067715S","chronDate":"21-23 Sept. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4662551","isNumber":"4668275","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4662551","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"4668275","articleId":"4668299","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4668300,"authors":[{"name":"Luis V.

Such problems are distinct from current benchmark problems where the dimension of the particles is fixed. One well-studied application of VD-PSO is probability density estimation by Gaussian Mixture Models. A particle in VD-PSO includes a discrete number as the number of components and a set of real-valued component parameters. The number of components varies according to a random scheme, which dictates how many sets of components remain or expand. The component parameters are matched up supporting a linked update. Three other methods, the last two of which are also proposed by us as intuitive attempts to solve the varying dimensional problems, are compared with VD-PSO: 1. binary-headered PSO, 2. exhaustive PSO, 3. discrete-headered PSO. Simulations on known data with specified components show that VD-PSO provides a competitive density estimation to the exhaustive PSO, but spends the least wall-clock-time among all algorithms, almost 12% of the exhaustive PSO, while the binary-headered PSO or discrete-headered PSO do not achieve similar performance, because the binary-headered PSO is adversely affected by the dummy parameters, and the discrete-headered PSO makes too many dimension variations before the parameters are well tuned. The new VD-PSO algorithm is a viable and efficient solution to varying dimensional optimization problems.","doi":"10.1109/SIS.2008.4668310","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Swarm Intelligence Symposium","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SIS.2008.4668310","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4668275","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Swarm Intelligence Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/4662551/4668275/04668310.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Varying dimensional particle swarm optimization","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4668310/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Varying dimensional particle swarm optimization","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4668310/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10390001","publicationDate":"Sept. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"07 November 2008","conferenceDate":"21-23 Sept. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-23 Sept. 2008","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Varying dimensional particle swarm optimization","confLoc":"St. Louis, MO, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-11032008-00035.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05356S","chronDate":"21-23 Sept. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4662551","isNumber":"4668275","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4662551","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4668275","articleId":"4668310","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":4668315,"authors":[{"name":"Taufik Abrao","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, State University of Londrina, Parana, Brazil"],"firstName":"Taufik","lastName":"Abrao","id":"37270219700"},{"name":"Fernando Ciriaco","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, State University of Londrina, Parana, Brazil"],"firstName":"Fernando","lastName":"Ciriaco","id":"37299832100"},{"name":"Leonardo D.

However, the computational complexities could differ substantially depending on the operation system conditions. The complexities of the HEUR-MUDs were carefully analyzed in order to demonstrate that 1-LS scheme provides the best trade-off between implementation complexity aspects and bit error rate (BER) performance when applied to multiuser detection of S/MIMO MC-CDMA systems with low order modulation.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Swarm Intelligence Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/4662551/4668275/04668315.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Swarm Intelligence Symposium","doi":"10.1109/SIS.2008.4668315","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SIS.2008.4668315","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4668275","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4668315","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Weighting particle swarm, simulation annealing and local search optimization for S/MIMO MC-CDMA systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Particle swarm optimization","Simulated annealing","MIMO","Multicarrier code division multiple access","Multiuser detection","Receiving antennas","Computational complexity","Bit error rate","Transmitting antennas","Multiaccess communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiple access","diversity reception","error statistics","MIMO communication","Monte Carlo methods","multiuser detection","particle swarm optimisation","search problems","simulated annealing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["weighting particle swarm optimization","simulation annealing","local search optimization","S/MIMO MC-CDMA system","multicarrier multiuser detection","single-multiple transmit antenna","multiple receive antennas code division multiple ccess","unitary Hamming distance search","single-objective antenna-diversity-aided optimization","Monte-Carlo simulation","bit error rate"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["MC-CDMA","multiuser detection","particle swarm optimization","simulating annealing","single-objective optimization","unitary Hamming distance search"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4668315/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-23 Sept. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Weighting particle swarm, simulation annealing and local search optimization for S/MIMO MC-CDMA systems","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4668315/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2008","accessionNumber":"10390005","dateOfInsertion":"07 November 2008","conferenceDate":"21-23 Sept. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Weighting particle swarm, simulation annealing and local search optimization for S/MIMO MC-CDMA systems","confLoc":"St. Louis, MO, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-11032008-00040.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066061S","chronDate":"21-23 Sept. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4662551","isNumber":"4668275","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4662551","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4668275","articleId":"4668315","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4668316,"authors":[{"name":"Bipul Luitel","affiliation":["The Real-Time Power and Intelligent Systems Laboratory, Missouri University of Science and Technology, Rolla, MO, USA"],"firstName":"Bipul","lastName":"Luitel","id":"37398999600"},{"name":"Ganesh Kumar Venayagamoorthy","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Missouri University of Science and Technology, Rolla, MO, USA"],"firstName":"Ganesh Kumar","lastName":"Venayagamoorthy","id":"37273360200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2704-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2705-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4668316","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":17,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":187},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4668316","abstract":"In this paper, particle swarm optimization with quantum infusion (PSO-QI) has been applied for the design of digital filters.

The steering performance of the optimal FLC is compared with a PID type autopilot designed with and without PSO.","doi":"10.1109/SIS.2008.4668327","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Swarm Intelligence Symposium","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SIS.2008.4668327","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4668275","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Swarm Intelligence Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/4662551/4668275/04668327.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design of intelligent ship autopilots using particle swarm optimization","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4668327/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Design of intelligent ship autopilots using particle swarm optimization","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4668327/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10393480","publicationDate":"Sept. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"07 November 2008","conferenceDate":"21-23 Sept. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-23 Sept. 2008","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design of intelligent ship autopilots using particle swarm optimization","confLoc":"St. Louis, MO, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-11032008-00052.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057612S","chronDate":"21-23 Sept. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4662551","isNumber":"4668275","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4662551","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"4668275","articleId":"4668327","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4668330,"authors":[{"name":"Chuan Yan","affiliation":["Real-time Power and Intelligent systems (RTPIS) laboratory in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Missouri University of Science and Technology, Rolla, MO, USA"],"firstName":"Chuan","lastName":"Yan","id":"37671456100"},{"name":"Ganesh K.

The methodology is described and then evaluated under various testing conditions. The new tool allows a greater variety of stroke patterns to be processed automatically. Furthermore, for the first time, the extraction accuracy is quantified empirically, taking advantage of the exponential relationships that link the dispersion of the extraction errors with its signal-to-noise ratio. A new extraction system which combines this algorithm with two other previously published methods is also described and evaluated.

Although the problem is receiving growing interest, most approaches assume a one-to-one correspondence among local features, restricting their ability to learn true abstractions of a shape. In this paper, we present a new technique for learning an abstract shape prototype from a set of exemplars whose features are in many-to-many correspondence. Focusing on the domain of 2D shape, we represent a silhouette as a medial axis graph whose nodes correspond to \"parts\u201d defined by medial branches and whose edges connect adjacent parts. Given a pair of medial axis graphs, we establish a many-to-many correspondence between their nodes to find correspondences among articulating parts. Based on these correspondences, we recover the abstracted medial axis graph along with the positional and radial attributes associated with its nodes. We evaluate the abstracted prototypes in the context of a recognition task.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4668348/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 November 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4668348/","dateOfInsertion":"21 March 2009","publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10520200","pubMedId":"19299866","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"31","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Skeletal Shape Abstraction from Examples","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Skeletal Shape Abstraction from Examples","sourcePdf":"ttp2009050944.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.066751S","chronDate":"May  2009","xplore-pub-id":"34","isNumber":"4804117","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"38","xplore-issue":"4804117","articleId":"4668348","onlineDate":"07 November 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4668361,"authors":[{"name":"Daniel Schonberg","affiliation":["Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, WA, USA","University of California, Berkeley, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/10206/4668355/4668361/4668361-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Daniel Schonberg (M'07) received the B.S.E. and M.S.E. degrees in electrical engineering from the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, in 2001, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from the University of California, Berkeley in 2007.","Currently, he is with the Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, WA, where he works on media coding, and is a contributor toward the standardization of JPEG XR.

Encryption masks the source, rendering traditional compression algorithms ineffective. By conceiving of the problem as one of distributed source coding, it has been shown in prior work that encrypted data are as compressible as unencrypted data. However, there are two major challenges to realize these theoretical results. The first is the development of models that capture the underlying statistical structure and are compatible with our framework. The second is that since the source is masked by encryption, the compressor does not know what rate to target. We tackle these issues in this paper. We first develop statistical models for images before extending it to videos, where our techniques really gain traction. As an illustration, we compare our results to a state-of-the-art motion-compensated lossless video encoder that requires unencrypted video input. The latter compresses each unencrypted frame of the ldquoForemanrdquo test sequence by 59% on average. In comparison, our proof-of-concept implementation, working on encrypted data, compresses the same sequence by 33%. Next, we develop and present an adaptive protocol for universal compression and show that it converges to the entropy rate. Finally, we demonstrate a complete implementation for encrypted video.","doi":"10.1109/TIFS.2008.2007244","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security","pdfPath":"/iel5/10206/4668355/04668361.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIFS.2008.2007244","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4668355","startPage":"749","endPage":"762","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Toward Compression of Encrypted Images and Video Sequences","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4668361","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Toward Compression of Encrypted Images and Video Sequences","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4668361/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 November 2008","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"3","issue":"4","publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","accessionNumber":"10313211","dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4668361/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Toward Compression of Encrypted Images and Video Sequences","sourcePdf":"03tifs04-dschonberg-2007244.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.126164S","chronDate":"Dec.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"10206","isNumber":"4668355","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10206","citationCount":"43","xplore-issue":"4668355","articleId":"4668361","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4668365,"authors":[{"name":"Kai Wang","affiliation":["UMR 5205 CNRS, INSA-Lyon, LIRIS, Villeurbanne, France"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/10206/4668355/4668365/4668365-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Kai Wang received the B.E. degree in telecommunications engineering and the M.E. degree in pattern recognition and intelligent systems from Xian Jiaotong University, Xi'an, China, in 2003 and 2006, respectively, and the Generalist Engineer degree from Ecole Centrale de Lyon, Ecully, France, in 2006.

Three blind watermarks are inserted in a semiregular mesh with different purposes: a geometrically robust watermark for copyright protection, a high-capacity watermark for carrying a large amount of auxiliary information, and a fragile watermark for content authentication. The proposed framework is based on wavelet transform of the semiregular mesh. More precisely, the three watermarks are inserted in different appropriate resolution levels obtained by wavelet decomposition of the mesh: the robust watermark is inserted by modifying the norms of the wavelet coefficient vectors associated with the lowest resolution level; the fragile watermark is embedded in the high resolution level obtained just after one wavelet decomposition by modifying the orientations and norms of the wavelet coefficient vectors; the high-capacity watermark is inserted in one or several intermediate levels by considering groups of wavelet coefficient vector norms as watermarking primitives. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework: the robust watermark is able to resist all common geometric attacks even with a relatively strong amplitude; the fragile watermark is robust to content-preserving operations, while being sensitive to other attacks of which it can also provide the precise location; the payload of the high-capacity watermark increases rapidly along with the number of watermarking primitives.","doi":"10.1109/TIFS.2008.2007229","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security","pdfPath":"/iel5/10206/4668355/04668365.pdf","startPage":"620","endPage":"634","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIFS.2008.2007229","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4668355","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hierarchical Watermarking of Semiregular Meshes Based on Wavelet Transform","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4668365","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 November 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4668365/","displayDocTitle":"Hierarchical Watermarking of Semiregular Meshes Based on Wavelet Transform","volume":"3","issue":"4","publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","accessionNumber":"10313214","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4668365/","dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hierarchical Watermarking of Semiregular Meshes Based on Wavelet Transform","sourcePdf":"03tifs04-kwang-2007229.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.157632S","chronDate":"Dec.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"10206","isNumber":"4668355","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10206","citationCount":"40","xplore-issue":"4668355","articleId":"4668365","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4668368,"authors":[{"name":"Matthias Kirchner","affiliation":["Faculty of Computer Science, Technische Universit\u00e4t Dresden, Dresden, Germany"],"bio":{"p":["Matthias Kirchner graduated in information systems technology from Technische Universit\u00e4t Dresden, Dresden, Germany, in 2007, where he is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree in the privacy and security group.

We focus on the class of phase coded pulse trains and determine the radar code which approximately maximizes the detection performance under a similarity constraint with a prefixed radar code. This is tantamount to forcing a similarity between the ambiguity functions of the devised waveform and of the pulse train encoded with the prefixed sequence. We consider the cases of both continuous and finite phase alphabet, and formulate the code design in terms of a nonconvex, NP-hard quadratic optimization problem. In order to approximate the optimal solutions, we propose techniques (with polynomial computational complexity) based on the method of semidefinite program (SDP) relaxation and randomization. Moreover, we also derive approximation bounds yielding a ldquomeasure of goodnessrdquo of the devised algorithms. At the analysis stage, we assess the performance of the new encoding techniques both in terms of detection performance and ambiguity function, under different choices for the similarity parameter. We also show that the new algorithms achieve an accurate approximation of the optimal solution with a modest number of randomizations.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2008.2008247","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/4773578/04668417.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2008.2008247","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4773578","startPage":"610","endPage":"621","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design of Phase Codes for Radar Performance Optimization With a Similarity Constraint","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4668417","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Design of Phase Codes for Radar Performance Optimization With a Similarity Constraint","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4668417/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 November 2008","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"57","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Feb. 2009","accessionNumber":"10470637","dateOfInsertion":"03 February 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4668417/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design of Phase Codes for Radar Performance Optimization With a Similarity Constraint","sourcePdf":"57tsp02-ademaio-2008247.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.088989S","chronDate":"Feb.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"4773578","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"122","xplore-issue":"4773578","articleId":"4668417","onlineDate":"07 November 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4668418,"authors":[{"name":"Shahram Karimi","affiliation":["Groupe de Recherche en Electrotechnique et Electronique de Nancy, Universit\u00e9 Henri Poincar\u00e9, Lorraine, France"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/4681672/4668418/4668418-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Shahram Karimi (S'07) was born in Kermanshah, Iran, in 1972.

The fuel cell and the battery are connected to the same voltage bus through an appropriate hybrid full-bridge LLC resonant unidirectional converter and a three-level buck/boost bidirectional converter, respectively. The battery is an auxiliary energy source, powers the load during the system's start state to make it easy for the system to cold start, and provides or absorbs the dynamic power when the load varies and the fuel cell cannot respond immediately, so the system dynamic characteristics are improved. Furthermore, the battery can also provide peak power at overload, so the power rating of the fuel cell can be decreased, which reduces the total system cost. In order to ensure that the system operates with high efficiency, this paper also proposes a power management control scheme, which controls the bidirectional converter operating under buck, boost, or shutdown mode according to the operation condition of the fuel cell and battery, so that the battery can be charged or discharged. The operation of the system during cold start and overload are analyzed in detail. A 1-kW fuel cell power system was built in the laboratory. Experimental results are shown to verify the theoretical analysis.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 November 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4668419/","volume":"56","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/4668419/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10557968","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","dateOfInsertion":"31 March 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A Hybrid Fuel Cell Power System","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Hybrid Fuel Cell Power System","sourcePdf":"tie-jin-2008336.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.075415S","chronDate":"April  2009","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"4808369","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"215","xplore-issue":"4808369","articleId":"4668419","onlineDate":"07 November 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4668420,"authors":[{"name":"Vasanthan Raghavan","affiliation":["Coordinated Science Laboratory and the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, Urbana-Champaign, IL, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/4668621/4668420/4668420-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Vasanthan Raghavan (S'01\u2013M'06) received the B.Tech. degree in electrical engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology, Madras, India, in 2001, the M.S. and the Ph.D. degrees in electrical and computer engineering in 2004 and 2006 respectively, and the M.A. degree in mathematics in 2005, all from the University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, WI.","He is currently a Postdoctoral Research Associate with the Coordinated Science Laboratory, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.

Motivated by standardization efforts embraced by the industry, the focus of this work is on systematic precoder design with realistic assumptions on the spatial correlation, channel state information (CSI) at the transmitter and the receiver, and implementation complexity. For the spatial correlation of the channel matrix, we assume a general channel model, based on physical principles, that has been verified by many recent measurement campaigns. We also assume a coherent, linear minimum mean-square error (MMSE) receiver and knowledge of the spatial statistics at the transmitter along with the presence of an ideal, low-rate feedback link from the receiver to the transmitter. The reverse link is used for codebook-index feedback and the goal of this work is to construct precoder codebooks, adaptable in response to the statistical information, such that the achievable throughput is significantly enhanced over that of a fixed, nonadaptive, independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) codebook design. We illustrate how a codebook of semiunitary precoder matrices localized around some fixed center on the Grassmann manifold can be skewed in response to the spatial correlation via low-complexity maps that can rotate and scale submanifolds on the Grassmann manifold. The skewed codebook in combination with a low-complexity statistical power allocation scheme is then shown to bridge the gap in performance between a perfect CSI benchmark and an i.i.d. codebook design.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2008.2005748","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/4668621/04668420.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2008.2005748","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4668621","startPage":"6017","endPage":"6030","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Quantized Multimode Precoding in Spatially Correlated Multiantenna Channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4668420","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Quantized Multimode Precoding in Spatially Correlated Multiantenna Channels","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4668420/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 November 2008","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"56","issue":"12","publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","accessionNumber":"10313334","dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4668420/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Quantized Multimode Precoding in Spatially Correlated Multiantenna Channels","sourcePdf":"56tsp12-vveeravalli-2005748.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.112187S","chronDate":"Dec.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"4668621","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"4668621","articleId":"4668420","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4668421,"authors":[{"name":"Antonio De Maio","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Ingegneria Elettronica e delle Telecomunicazioni, Universit\u00e0 degli Studi di Napoli Federico II, Napoli, Italy"],"firstName":"Antonio","lastName":"De Maio","id":"37272858900"},{"name":"Silvio De Nicola","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Ingegneria Elettronica e delle Telecomunicazioni, Universit\u00e0 degli Studi di Napoli Federico II, Napoli, Italy"],"firstName":"Silvio","lastName":"De Nicola","id":"37399180200"},{"name":"Yongwei Huang","affiliation":["Department of Systems Engineering and Engineering Management, Chinese University of Hong Kong, Sha Tin, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Yongwei","lastName":"Huang","id":"37404513100"},{"name":"Shuzhong Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Systems Engineering and Engineering Management, Chinese University of Hong Kong, Sha Tin, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Shuzhong","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37403501600"},{"name":"Alfonso Farina","affiliation":["SElectrical Sistemi Integrati S.P.A, Rome, Italy"],"firstName":"Alfonso","lastName":"Farina","id":"37274494900"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1053-587X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0476"}],"articleNumber":"4668421","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":33,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":681},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.signalprocessingsociety.org"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4668421","abstract":"This paper considers adaptive detection and estimation in the presence of useful signal and interference mismatches. We assume a homogeneous environment where the random disturbance components from the primary and secondary data share the same covariance matrix. Moreover, the data under test contains a deterministic interference vector in addition to the possible useful signal. We focus on the situation where an energy fraction of both the useful signal and the deterministic interference may lie outside their nominal subspaces (conical uncertainty model). Under these conditions, we devise a procedure for the computation of the joint maximum likelihood (ML) estimators of the useful signal and interference vectors, resorting to a suitable rank-one decomposition of a semidefinite program (SDP) problem optimal solution. Hence, we use the aforementioned estimators for the synthesis of adaptive receivers based on different generalized likelihood ratio test (GLRT) criteria. At the analysis stage, we assess the performance of the new detectors in comparison with some decision rules, available in open literature.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2008.2008249","startPage":"436","endPage":"450","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/4773578/04668421.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2008.2008249","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4773578","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive Detection and Estimation in the Presence of Useful Signal and Interference Mismatches","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Adaptive signal detection","Interference","Testing","Maximum likelihood estimation","Covariance matrix","Uncertainty","Maximum likelihood detection","Signal synthesis","Performance analysis","Detectors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive signal detection","covariance matrices","maximum likelihood estimation","signal denoising"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive detection","adaptive estimation","interference mismatches","useful signal","random disturbance components","primary data share","secondary data share","covariance matrix","joint maximum likelihood estimators","semideflnite program","generalized likelihood ratio test"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Adaptive detection","nonconvex quadratic optimization","radar signal processing","semidefinite programming relaxation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4668421/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 November 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2009","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive Detection and Estimation in the Presence of Useful Signal and Interference Mismatches","volume":"57","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"03 February 2009","accessionNumber":"10498649","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive Detection and Estimation in the Presence of Useful Signal and Interference Mismatches","sourcePdf":"57tsp02-ademaio-2008249.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.046751S","chronDate":"Feb.  2009","isNumber":"4773578","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"33","articleId":"4668421","onlineDate":"07 November 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4668422,"authors":[{"name":"Claudio Turchetti","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Ingegneria Biomedica, Elettronica e Telecomunicazioni, Universit\u00e0 Politecnica delle Marche, Ancona, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/4773578/4668422/4668422-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Claudio Turchetti (M'86) received the Electronics Engineering degree from the University of Ancona, Italy, in 1979.","He joined the Universit\u00e0 Politecnica delle Marche, Ancona, Italy, in 1980, where he was Director of the Department of Electronics, Artificial Intelligence and Telecommunications (DEIT) and is currently Full Professor of Electronics at the Department of Biomedical, Electronics, Telecommunication Engineering.

We formulate the testing problem in terms of real-valued Gaussian random vectors, so we can make use of some useful existing results which enable us to study the null distributions of two test statistics. The tests depend only on the sample-size <formula formulatype=\"inline\"><tex Notation=\"TeX\">$n $</tex></formula> and the dimensionality of the vector <formula formulatype=\"inline\"><tex Notation=\"TeX\">$p$</tex> </formula>. The basic behaviors of the distributions of the test statistics are derived and critical values (thresholds) are calculated and presented for certain <formula formulatype=\"inline\"><tex Notation=\"TeX\">$(n,p)$</tex> </formula> values.

Then we go on to introduce a new enhanced method for spectral analysis of nonuniformly sampled data sequences. The new method can be interpreted as an iteratively weighted LSP that makes use of a data-dependent weighting matrix built from the most recent spectral estimate. Because this method is derived for the case of real-valued data (which is typically more complicated to deal with in spectral analysis than the complex-valued data case), it is iterative and it makes use of an adaptive (i.e., data-dependent) weighting, we refer to it as the real-valued iterative adaptive approach (RIAA). LSP and RIAA are nonparametric methods that can be used for the spectral analysis of general data sequences with both continuous and discrete spectra. However, they are most suitable for data sequences with discrete spectra (i.e., sinusoidal data), which is the case we emphasize in this paper.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/4783546/04668424.pdf","startPage":"843","endPage":"858","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2008.2008973","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2008.2008973","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4783546","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Spectral Analysis of Nonuniformly Sampled Data: A New Approach Versus the Periodogram","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4668424/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 November 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2009","displayDocTitle":"Spectral Analysis of Nonuniformly Sampled Data: A New Approach Versus the Periodogram","htmlLink":"/document/4668424/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2009","dateOfInsertion":"13 February 2009","accessionNumber":"10479019","isJournal":true,"volume":"57","issue":"3","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spectral Analysis of Nonuniformly Sampled Data: A New Approach Versus the Periodogram","sourcePdf":"57tsp02-jli-2008973.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.093196S","chronDate":"March  2009","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"4783546","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"107","xplore-issue":"4783546","articleId":"4668424","onlineDate":"07 November 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4668426,"authors":[{"name":"Lan Wei","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Center of Integrated Systems, University of Stanford, Stanford, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7729/4711479/4668426/4668426-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Lan Wei (S\u201906) received the B.S. degree in microelectronics from Peking University, Beijing, China, in 2005, and the M.S. degree in electrical engineering in 2007 from Stanford University, Stanford, CA, where she is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering in the Department of Electrical Engineering and Center for Integrated Systems.","Her current research interests include device and circuit areas with the focus on device scaling and benchmarking from a perspective of circuit-level performance taking parasitic capacitances into consideration."]},"firstName":"Lan","lastName":"Wei","id":"37399163100"},{"name":"Jie Deng","affiliation":["IBM SRDC, Hopewell Junction, NY, USA","Department of Electrical Engineering and Center of Integrated Systems, University of Stanford, Stanford, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7729/4711479/4668426/4668426-photo-2-source-small.gif","p":["Jie Deng (S\u201905\u2013M\u201908) received the B.S. degree from Beijing University, Beijing, China, in 2001, and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from Stanford University, Stanford, CA, in 2004 and 2007, respectively.","In June 2007, he joined IBM SRDC, Hopewell Junction, NY, where he is engaged in research on logic performance benchmarking and IDDQ modeling.

We show that 1-D devices are not necessarily better than 2-D devices for future technologies, especially for low-channel densities and narrow gate widths, due to the parasitic capacitances and screening of the adjacent channels. For example, the delay improvement is overestimated from the intrinsic cases by at least 30%-60% from ignoring parasitics and channel screening effects, for W\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">gate</sub>\n<10 L\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">g</sub>\n and channel densities from 400 to 25 mum.

In this paper, a novel wideband spectrum sensing technique referred to as \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">multiband</i>\n \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">joint</i>\n \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">detection</i>\n is introduced, which jointly detects the primary signals over multiple frequency bands rather than over one band at a time.

By exploiting the hidden convexity in the seemingly nonconvex problems, optimal solutions can be obtained for multiband joint detection under practical conditions. The situation in which individual cognitive radios might not be able to reliably detect weak primary signals due to channel fading/shadowing is also considered. To address this issue by exploiting the spatial diversity, a cooperative wideband spectrum sensing scheme refereed to as \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">spatial-spectral</i>\n \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">joint</i>\n \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">detection</i>\n is proposed, which is based on a linear combination of the local statistics from multiple spatially distributed cognitive radios. The cooperative sensing problem is also mapped into an optimization problem, for which suboptimal solutions can be obtained through mathematical transformation under conditions of practical interest. Simulation results show that the proposed spectrum sensing schemes can considerably improve system performance. This paper establishes useful principles for the design of distributed wideband spectrum sensing algorithms in cognitive radio networks.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2008.2008540","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4783546","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2008.2008540","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/4783546/04668431.pdf","startPage":"1128","endPage":"1140","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal Multiband Joint Detection for Spectrum Sensing in Cognitive Radio Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 November 2008","displayDocTitle":"Optimal Multiband Joint Detection for Spectrum Sensing in Cognitive Radio Networks","volume":"57","issue":"3","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2009","dateOfInsertion":"13 February 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4668431/","publicationDate":"March 2009","accessionNumber":"10498795","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4668431/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal Multiband Joint Detection for Spectrum Sensing in Cognitive Radio Networks","sourcePdf":"tsp-quan-2008540.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.127748S","chronDate":"March  2009","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"4783546","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"531","xplore-issue":"4783546","articleId":"4668431","onlineDate":"07 November 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-21"},{"_id":4668432,"authors":[{"name":"Nguyen Nam Tran","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Telecommunications, University of New South Wales, Sydney, NSW, Australia"],"bio":{"p":["Nguyen Nam Tran was born in Quang Nam, Vietnam.

To achieve this, the definition of ldquocorrectrdquo gait needs to adapted both to the individual patient and to the situation. Recently, we proposed a method for online trajectory generation that can be applied for hemiparetic subjects. Desired states for one (disabled) leg are generated online based on the movements of the other (sound) leg. An instantaneous mapping between legs is performed by exploiting physiological interjoint couplings. This way, the patient generates the reference motion for the affected leg autonomously. The approach, called Complementary Limb Motion Estimation (CLME), is implemented on the LOPES gait rehabilitation robot and evaluated with healthy subjects in two different experiments. In a previously described study, subjects walk only with one leg, while the robot's other leg acts as a fake prosthesis, to simulate complete loss of function in one leg. This study showed that CLME ensures stable gait. In a second study, to be presented in this paper, healthy subjects walk with both their own legs to assess the interference with self-determined walking. Evaluation criteria are: Power delivered to the joints by the robot, electromyography (EMG) distortions, and kinematic distortions, all compared to zero torque control, which is the baseline of minimum achievable interference. Results indicate that interference of the robot is lower with CLME than with a fixed reference trajectory, mainly in terms of lowered exchanged power and less alteration of EMG. This implies that subjects can walk more naturally with CLME, and they are assisted less by the robot when it is not needed. Future studies with patients are yet to show whether these properties of CLME transfer to the clinical domain.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Rehabilitation robotics","Motion estimation","Leg","Legged locomotion","Interference","Electromyography","Human robot interaction","Prosthetics","Kinematics","Torque control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electromyography","gait analysis","medical robotics","patient rehabilitation","prosthetics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["rehabilitation robots","complementary limb motion estimation","reference trajectory generation","hemiparetic subjects","legs","physiological interjoint couplings","LOPES gait rehabilitation robot","fake prosthesis","self-determined walking","electromyography distortions","kinematic distortions","zero torque control"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Assist-as-needed","exoskeletons","gait therapy","intention estimation","legged locomotion","shared control","stroke","synergies"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Adult","Aged","Algorithms","Biomechanics","Data Interpretation, Statistical","Electromyography","Extremities","Female","Gait","Gait Disorders, Neurologic","Humans","Leg","Male","Middle Aged","Movement","Reference Values","Rehabilitation","Robotics"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4668434","doi":"10.1109/TNSRE.2008.2008278","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Systems and Rehabilitation Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/7333/4782182/04668434.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNSRE.2008.2008278","startPage":"23","endPage":"30","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4782182","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Systems and Rehabilitation Engineering","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reference Trajectory Generation for Rehabilitation Robots: Complementary Limb Motion Estimation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Reference Trajectory Generation for Rehabilitation Robots: Complementary Limb Motion Estimation","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4668434/","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 November 2008","volume":"17","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/4668434/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"10 February 2009","publicationDate":"Feb. 2009","accessionNumber":"10473093","pubMedId":"19211320","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reference Trajectory Generation for Rehabilitation Robots: Complementary Limb Motion Estimation","sourcePdf":"tnsre-vallery-2008278.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.076069S","chronDate":"Feb.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"7333","isNumber":"4782182","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7333","citationCount":"130","xplore-issue":"4782182","articleId":"4668434","onlineDate":"07 November 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4668435,"authors":[{"name":"Raphael Banz","affiliation":["Spinal Cord Injury Center, Balgrist University Hospital, Zurich, Switzerland","ETH Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7333/4782182/4668435/4668435-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Raphael Banz studied biology at the University of Fribourg, Switzerland and human movement sciences at the University of Calgary, Canada and at the ETH Zurich, Switzerland.

In the driven gait orthosis (DGO) Lokomat, an estimation of the patient's activity level was based on man-machine interaction forces as measured at the hip and knee actuators of the exoskeletal device. In an early approach, theoretical assumptions about the expected man-machine interaction forces, due to the varying behavior of the patients, were formulated for the calculation of quantitative biofeedback. In contrast to this theory-based approach, we have developed a novel method where the biofeedback calculations were based on measured reference man-machine interaction force profiles of healthy subjects when walking with different degrees of activity. To account for intrasubject and intersubject variability, reference force profiles were processed in a model to generate multiple force profiles describing each activity state. To estimate the activity of a subject walking in the DGO, the man-machine interaction force profile was measured, matched to each of the generated force profiles, and the best fitting profile of the different activity states was identified by the smallest Euclidian distance, respectively. By calculating the difference between these Euclidian distances, a quantitative estimate of the patient's degree of activity was obtained. The novel method was evaluated and compared to the conventional approach in a study with 18 healthy subjects. This comparison showed that the novel method was more reliable in detecting different activity states and is, therefore, a promising approach for future biofeedback systems.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4668435/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 November 2008","volume":"17","issue":"1","accessionNumber":"10478643","pubMedId":"19211319","publicationDate":"Feb. 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4668435/","dateOfInsertion":"10 February 2009","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A Method of Estimating the Degree of Active Participation During Stepping in a Driven Gait Orthosis Based on Actuator Force Profile Matching","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Method of Estimating the Degree of Active Participation During Stepping in a Driven Gait Orthosis Based on Actuator Force Profile Matching","sourcePdf":"16tnsre06-rbanz-2008281.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.08878S","chronDate":"Feb.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"7333","isNumber":"4782182","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7333","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"4782182","articleId":"4668435","onlineDate":"07 November 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4668436,"authors":[{"name":"Catherine R.

We speculated that subjects were primarily responding to the local mechanical assistance of the exoskeleton rather than directly attempting to reduce exoskeleton mechanical power via decreases in soleus activity. To test this observation we studied ten healthy subjects walking on a treadmill at 1.25 m/s while wearing a robotic exoskeleton proportionally controlled by medial gastrocnemius activation. We hypothesized that subjects would primarily decrease soleus activity due to its synergistic mechanics with the exoskeleton. Subjects decreased medial gastrocnemius recruitment by 12% (p < 0.05) but decreased soleus recruitment by 27% (p < 0.05). In agreement with our hypothesis, the primary reduction in muscle activity was not for the control muscle (medial gastrocnemius) but for the anatomical synergist to the exoskeleton (soleus). These findings indicate that anatomical morphology needs to be considered carefully when designing software and hardware for robotic exoskeletons.","doi":"10.1109/TNSRE.2008.2008285","startPage":"31","endPage":"37","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Systems and Rehabilitation Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/7333/4782182/04668436.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Systems and Rehabilitation Engineering","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNSRE.2008.2008285","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4782182","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Medial Gastrocnemius Myoelectric Control of a Robotic Ankle Exoskeleton","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Robot control","Exoskeletons","Legged locomotion","Recruitment","Muscles","Laboratories","Electromyography","Kinematics","Testing","Proportional control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electromyography","gait analysis","medical robotics","muscle"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["medial gastrocnemius myoelectric control","robotic ankle exoskeleton","walking","medial gastrocnemius activation","soleus activity","muscle activity","control muscle","anatomical synergist"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Biomechanics","electromyography (EMG)","gait","locomotion","motor learning"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Adult","Ankle","Biomechanics","Electromyography","Equipment Design","Female","Foot","Foot","Humans","Kinetics","Male","Muscle, Skeletal","Robotics","Young Adult"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4668436/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 November 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2009","displayDocTitle":"Medial Gastrocnemius Myoelectric Control of a Robotic Ankle Exoskeleton","volume":"17","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/4668436/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"10 February 2009","accessionNumber":"10473090","pubMedId":"19211321","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Medial Gastrocnemius Myoelectric Control of a Robotic Ankle Exoskeleton","sourcePdf":"16tnsre06-dferris-2008285.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.0635S","chronDate":"Feb.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"7333","isNumber":"4782182","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7333","citationCount":"47","xplore-issue":"4782182","articleId":"4668436","onlineDate":"07 November 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4668438,"authors":[{"name":"Tao Cui","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/4773578/4668438/4668438-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Tao Cui (S'04) received the M.Sc. degree in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB, Canada, in 2005 and the M.S. degree from the Department of Electrical Engineering, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, in 2006.

Relaying protocols using two, three, and four time slots are proposed. The protocols using four time slots are the traditional amplify-and-forward (AF) and decode-and-forward (DF) protocols, which do not consider the property of the two-way traffic. A new class of relaying protocols, termed as partial decode-and-forward (PDF), is developed for the two time slots transmission, where each relay first removes part of the noise before sending the signal to the two terminals. Protocols using three time slots are proposed to compensate the fact that the two time slots protocols cannot make use of direct transmission between the two terminals. For all protocols, after processing their received signals, the relays encode the resulting signals using a distributed linear dispersion (LD) code. The proposed AF protocols are shown to achieve the diversity order of min{N,K}(1- (log log P/log P)), where N is the number of relays, P is the total power of the network, and K is the number of symbols transmitted during each time slot. When random unitary matrix is used for LD code, the proposed PDF protocols resemble random linear network coding, where the former operates on the unitary group and the latter works on the finite field. Moreover, PDF achieves the diversity order of min{N,K} but the conventional DF can only achieve the diversity order of 1. Finally, we find that two time slots protocols also have advantages over four-time-slot protocols in media access control (MAC) layer.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4668438/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 November 2008","volume":"57","issue":"2","accessionNumber":"10470639","publicationDate":"Feb. 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4668438/","dateOfInsertion":"03 February 2009","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Distributed Space\u2013Time Coding for Two-Way Wireless Relay Networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distributed Space\u2013Time Coding for Two-Way Wireless Relay Networks","sourcePdf":"57tsp02-anallanathan-2009025.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.104743S","chronDate":"Feb.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"4773578","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"169","xplore-issue":"4773578","articleId":"4668438","onlineDate":"07 November 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4668449,"authors":[{"name":"L.

The width of the formed defect band is increased compared to that of classical EBG structures with defect. The new material composed of a double-layer FSS is applied in the design of a resonator antenna. The resonator, formed between the double-layer FSS and a metallic ground, is fed by a patch source placed at the proximity of the ground.

Intensive noise measurements in the time domain were thus carried out on five different vehicles. Preliminary trials were first made on a stationary vehicle and the motor idling, but the characteristics of the measured low-amplitude pulses greatly vary from one car to another. We thus emphasize the characteristics of high-amplitude pulses, greater than 70 mV, observed when the vehicles were moving in traffic, during a 20-min trip. Noise is statistically characterized in terms of duration, frequency content, peak amplitude, and time interval between successive pulses. Stochastic models based on mathematical distribution functions and fitting the experimental distribution of the various pulse characteristics are proposed. It has been found that interarrival time, i.e., the time interval between two successive pulses, is rather short and would be thus the most critical parameter when optimizing the power line communication physical layer.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electromagnetic Compatibility","pdfPath":"/iel5/15/4669925/04668450.pdf","startPage":"861","endPage":"868","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electromagnetic Compatibility","doi":"10.1109/TEMC.2008.2006851","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TEMC.2008.2006851","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4669925","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4668450","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Impulsive Noise Characterization of In-Vehicle Power Line","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Noise","Noise measurement","Vehicles","Pulse measurements","Electromagnetic compatibility","Bandwidth","Automotive engineering"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["carrier transmission on power lines","electric motors","impulse noise","stochastic systems","vehicles"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["in-vehicle power line communication","impulsive noise","intensive noise measurements","stationary vehicle","motor idling","high-amplitude pulses","stochastic models","mathematical distribution functions"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Impulsive noise","in-vehicle power line communication","wire communication"]},{"kwd":["Impulsive noise","in-vehicle power line communication","wire communication"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4668450/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 November 2008","displayDocTitle":"Impulsive Noise Characterization of In-Vehicle Power Line","volume":"50","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/4668450/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","accessionNumber":"10313186","dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Impulsive Noise Characterization of In-Vehicle Power Line","sourcePdf":"temc-degauque-2006851.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.0791S","chronDate":"Nov.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"15","isNumber":"4669925","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"15","citationCount":"54","xplore-issue":"4669925","articleId":"4668450","onlineDate":"07 November 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4668461,"authors":[{"name":"Chang-Tsung Fu","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering,National Nano Device Laboratories, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/22/4696624/4668461/4668461-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Chang-Tsung Fu (S'00) received the B.S. degree in communication engineering and M.S. degree in electrical engineering from National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan, in 1996 and 2001, respectively, and is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree at National Chiao-Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan.

The proposed design methodology relies on substitution of quarter-wavelength transmission line segments with their equivalent low-pass structures. The ferroelectric BST-varactors are used as tuning elements and allow for a frequency agile behavior and size reduction of the circuit. Candidates for this methodology are quarter-wavelength based circuits such as Wilkinson power dividers and branch-line couplers. Prototype boards for both topologies were implemented and characterized through scattering parameter measurements. For the implemented Wilkinson divider a tuning range from 1.7 to 2.1 GHz is achieved. The insertion loss in both output paths varies from 0.6 to 1.2 dB while maintaining a worst case amplitude- and phase difference of 0.5 dB and 9deg, respectively, for all operating cases.

A subsampling technique is used to reduce the bandwidth of the test signal without changing the waveform characteristics. This cancels the memory effects of the amplifier without affecting its static behavior. Memoryless AM/AM and AM/PM characteristics are measured as a function of the carrier frequency. This points out the contribution of the frequency dependency of the amplifier's static nonlinearity to its behavior under wideband signal drive. A memoryless post-compensation technique is then introduced to accurately assess the performance of several behavioral models. In fact, it is demonstrated that direct comparison of the measured output of the device-under-test with the estimated output does not provide reliable assessment of the model performance. Conversely, memoryless post-compensation efficiently differentiates the performance of these models. To provide a comprehensive approach for model validation and prototype performance evaluation, memory effects intensity metrics are introduced. These metrics are applied to evaluate the memory effects present in a 300-W peak power Doherty amplifier driven by various multicarrier wideband code division multiple access signals.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel5/22/4696623/04668469.pdf","startPage":"3170","endPage":"3179","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","doi":"10.1109/TMTT.2008.2006809","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMTT.2008.2006809","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4696623","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4668469","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Power Amplifiers' Model Assessment and Memory Effects Intensity Quantification Using Memoryless Post-Compensation Technique","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power amplifiers","Broadband amplifiers","Radiofrequency amplifiers","Multiaccess communication","Transmitters","Linearity","Bandwidth","Frequency","Predistortion","Power system modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiple access","memoryless systems","network analysis","nonlinear systems","power amplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power amplifiers","model assessment","memory effects intensity quantification","static nonlinearity characterization","subsampling technique","memoryless post-compensation technique","multicarrier wideband code division multiple access signals","power 300 W"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Behavioral modeling","digital predistortion","linearization","memory effects","post-compensation","power amplifier (PA)","static nonlinearity","third generation (3G)","wideband code division multiple access (WCDMA)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4668469/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 November 2008","displayDocTitle":"Power Amplifiers' Model Assessment and Memory Effects Intensity Quantification Using Memoryless Post-Compensation Technique","volume":"56","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/4668469/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","accessionNumber":"10349065","dateOfInsertion":"08 December 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Power Amplifiers' Model Assessment and Memory Effects Intensity Quantification Using Memoryless Post-Compensation Technique","sourcePdf":"56tmtt12-ohammi-2006809-pt2.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.074687S","chronDate":"Dec.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"22","isNumber":"4696623","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"29","xplore-issue":"4696623","articleId":"4668469","onlineDate":"07 November 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4668478,"authors":[{"name":"Jing Zhou","affiliation":["Department of Engineering Cybernetics, Norwegian University of Science and Technology, Trondheim, Norway"],"firstName":"Jing","lastName":"Zhou","id":"37291310500"},{"name":"Changyun Wen","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"firstName":"Changyun","lastName":"Wen","id":"37280264000"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9286"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2523"},{"format":"CD","value":"2334-3303"}],"articleNumber":"4668478","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":95,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1014},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Control Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieeecss.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Backstepping","Nonlinear systems","Adaptive control","Interconnected systems","Control systems","Distributed control","Signal design","Programmable control","Closed loop systems","Root mean square"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive control","closed loop systems","compensation","control system synthesis","decentralised control","interconnected systems","mean square error methods","nonlinear control systems","tracking"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decentralized backstepping adaptive output tracking","interconnected nonlinear system","smooth function","compensation","controller design","closed loop system","root mean square method","transient tracking error"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Adaptive control","backstepping","decentralized control","interconnected subsystems","tracking"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we propose a new totally decentralized adaptive output tracking scheme for a class of nonlinear interconnected systems by using a backstepping approach.

Among the different components in a system, memories are one of the parts most sensitive to soft errors due to their relatively large area. Due to their large cost, traditional techniques like triple modular redundancy are not used to protect memories. A typical approach is to apply error correction codes to correct single errors, and detect double errors. This type of codes, for example those based on Hamming, provides an initial level of protection. Detected single errors are usually corrected using scrubbing, by which the memory positions are periodically re-written after a fixed (deterministic scrubbing), or variable period (probabilistic scrubbing). These traditional models usually offer good results when calculating the reliability of memories (e.g. through the mean time to failure). However, there are some particularities that are not modeled through these approaches, to the best of our knowledge. One of these particularities is how double errors are handled. In a traditional approach, two errors in the same word produce always a system failure (only single errors can be corrected). However, if the two (or more) errors affect the same bit, either the second one reinforces the first one (keeping just a single error), or corrects it. In both scenarios, the resulting situation does not trigger a system failure, which has a direct impact on the reliability of the memory. In this paper, traditional reliability models are refined to handle the mentioned scenarios, which produces a more precise analysis in the calculation of mean time to failure for memory systems.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4668487/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 November 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2009","volume":"58","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"04 March 2009","publicationDate":"March 2009","accessionNumber":"10503048","htmlLink":"/document/4668487/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Reliability of Single-Error Correction Protected Memories","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reliability of Single-Error Correction Protected Memories","sourcePdf":"tr-maestro-2006470.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.112003S","chronDate":"March  2009","xplore-pub-id":"24","isNumber":"4797896","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"24","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"4797896","articleId":"4668487","onlineDate":"07 November 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4668495,"authors":[{"name":"Ranjan Kumar","affiliation":["Department of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan"],"bio":{"p":["Ranjan Kumar is currently a Graduate Student in the Department of Aeronautics and Astronautics at Kyoto University, Japan.

Multilevel redundancy allocation is an especially powerful approach for improving the system reliability of such hierarchical configurations, and system optimization problems that take advantage of this approach are termed multilevel redundancy allocation optimization problems (MRAOP). Despite the growing interest in MRAOP, a survey of the literature indicates that most redundancy allocation schemes are mainly confined to a single level, and few problem-specific MRAOP have been proposed or solved. The design variables in MRAOP are hierarchically structured. This paper proposes a new variable coding method in which these hierarchical design variables are represented by two types of hierarchical genotype, termed ordinal node, and terminal node. These genotypes preserve the logical linkage among the hierarchical variables, and allow every possible combination of redundancy during the optimization process. Furthermore, this paper developed a hierarchical genetic algorithm (HGA) that uses special genetic operators to handle the hierarchical genotype representation of hierarchical design variables. For comparison, the customized HGA, and a conventional genetic algorithm (GA) in which design variables are coded in vector forms, are applied to solve MRAOP for series systems having two different configurations. The solutions obtained when using HGA are shown to be superior to the conventional GA solutions, indicating that the HGA here is especially suitable for solving MRAOP for series systems.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4668495/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 November 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2008","dateOfInsertion":"02 December 2008","publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","accessionNumber":"10348679","htmlLink":"/document/4668495/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"57","issue":"4","isDynamicHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Multilevel Redundancy Allocation Optimization Using Hierarchical Genetic Algorithm","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multilevel Redundancy Allocation Optimization Using Hierarchical Genetic Algorithm","sourcePdf":"tr-kumar-2006079.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.104291S","chronDate":"Dec.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"24","isNumber":"4682503","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"24","citationCount":"33","xplore-issue":"4682503","articleId":"4668495","onlineDate":"07 November 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4668500,"authors":[{"name":"Xi-Ming Sun","affiliation":["Faculty of Advanced Technology, University of Glamorgan, Pontypridd, UK","Research Center of Information and Control, Dalian University of Technology, Dalian, China"],"firstName":"Xi-Ming","lastName":"Sun","id":"37534904400"},{"name":"Guo-Ping Liu","affiliation":["CSIS Laboratory, Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy and Sciences, Beijing, China","Faculty of Advanced Technology, University of Glamorgan, Pontypridd, UK"],"firstName":"Guo-Ping","lastName":"Liu","id":"37281349700"},{"name":"David Rees","affiliation":["Faculty of Advanced Technology, University of Glamorgan, Pontypridd, UK"],"firstName":"David","lastName":"Rees","id":"37273183400"},{"name":"Wei Wang","affiliation":["Research Center of Information and Control, Dalian University of Technology, Dalian, China"],"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Wang","id":"37280461100"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9286"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2523"},{"format":"CD","value":"2334-3303"}],"articleNumber":"4668500","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":156,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1018},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Control Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieeecss.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4668500","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Control systems","Time varying systems","Delay systems","Frequency","Sun","Networked control systems","Automatic control","Stability analysis","Control system synthesis","Sufficient conditions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["asymptotic stability","delay systems","failure analysis","linear matrix inequalities","Lyapunov methods","time-varying systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["time-varying delay system","control system stability","controller failure frequency","exponential stability","switched delay system","piecewise Lyapunov functional method","linear matrix inequality"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Controller failure","controller failure frequency","exponential stability","switched delay systems"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TAC.2008.2007528","pdfPath":"/iel5/9/4668472/04668500.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","startPage":"2391","endPage":"2396","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4668472","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAC.2008.2007528","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Stability of Systems With Controller Failure and Time-Varying Delay","abstract":"This paper studies the stability for a class of systems with time-varying delay subject to controller failure.

The design is synthesized using UMC 0.18 mum CMOS technology and simulated with Verilog-XL. The operating frequency of the synthesized core can exceed 50 MHz.","doi":"10.1109/TMM.2008.2004904","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Multimedia","pdfPath":"/iel5/6046/4674662/04668507.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4674662","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMM.2008.2004904","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Multimedia","startPage":"1250","endPage":"1260","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Low Complexity Detection of Discrete Cross Differences for Fast H.264/AVC Intra Prediction","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4668507","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 November 2008","displayDocTitle":"A Low Complexity Detection of Discrete Cross Differences for Fast H.264/AVC Intra Prediction","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4668507/","volume":"10","issue":"7","htmlLink":"/document/4668507/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","accessionNumber":"10324771","dateOfInsertion":"17 November 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Low Complexity Detection of Discrete Cross Differences for Fast H.264/AVC Intra Prediction","sourcePdf":"tmm-bharanitharan-2004904.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.072747S","chronDate":"Nov.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"6046","isNumber":"4674662","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6046","citationCount":"26","xplore-issue":"4674662","articleId":"4668507","onlineDate":"07 November 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4668524,"authors":[{"name":"Leonid B.

The purpose of the addressed filtering problem is to estimate the true concentrations of the mRNA and protein. Specifically, we are interested in designing a linear filter such that, in the presence of time delays, stochastic disturbances as well as sector nonlinearities, the filtering dynamics of state estimation for the stochastic genetic regulatory network is exponentially mean square stable with a prescribed decay rate lower bound beta. By using the linear matrix inequality (LMI) technique, sufficient conditions are first derived for ensuring the desired filtering performance for the gene regulatory model, and the filter gain is then characterized in terms of the solution to an LMI, which can be easily solved by using standard software packages. A simulation example is exploited in order to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed design procedures.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Filtering for Nonlinear Genetic Regulatory Networks With Stochastic Disturbances","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","doi":"10.1109/TAC.2008.2007862","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","pdfPath":"/iel5/9/4668472/04668532.pdf","startPage":"2448","endPage":"2457","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAC.2008.2007862","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4668472","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4668532","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4668532/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 November 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2008","displayDocTitle":"Filtering for Nonlinear Genetic Regulatory Networks With Stochastic Disturbances","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"53","issue":"10","htmlLink":"/document/4668532/","dateOfInsertion":"07 November 2008","publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","accessionNumber":"10301974","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Filtering for Nonlinear Genetic Regulatory Networks With Stochastic Disturbances","sourcePdf":"tac-wang-2007862.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.136203S","chronDate":"Nov.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"9","isNumber":"4668472","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9","citationCount":"121","xplore-issue":"4668472","articleId":"4668532","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4668535,"authors":[{"name":"Sungoh Kwon","affiliation":["Samsung Electronics Company Limited, Suwon, Gyeonggi, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/90/5075918/4668535/4668535-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Sungoh Kwon (S'05\u2013M'08) received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in electrical engineering from the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST), Daejeon, Korea, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical and computer engineering from Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, in 1994, 1996, and 2007, respectively.","From 1996 to 2001, he was a research staff member with Shinsegi Telecomm Inc., Seoul, Korea.

We estimate the nodal load, which is defined as the number of packets served at a node, induced by straight line routing. For a given total offered load on the network, our analysis shows that the nodal load at each node is a function of the node's Voronoi cell, the node's location in the network, and the traffic pattern specified by the source and destination randomness and straight line routing. In the asymptotic regime, we show that each node's probability that the node serves a packet arriving to the network approaches the products of half the length of the Voronoi cell perimeter and the load density function that a packet goes through the node's location. The density function depends on the traffic pattern generation by straight line routing, and determines where the hot spot is created in the network. Hence, contrary to conventional wisdom, straight line routing can balance the load over the network, depending on the traffic patterns.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4668535/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 November 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"17","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","dateOfInsertion":"16 June 2009","accessionNumber":"10704999","htmlLink":"/document/4668535/","displayDocTitle":"Analysis of Shortest Path Routing for Large Multi-Hop Wireless Networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis of Shortest Path Routing for Large Multi-Hop Wireless Networks","sourcePdf":"tnet-kwon-2002222.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.146977S","chronDate":"June  2009","xplore-pub-id":"90","isNumber":"5075918","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"90","citationCount":"24","xplore-issue":"5075918","articleId":"4668535","onlineDate":"07 November 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4668536,"authors":[{"name":"Lixian Zhang","affiliation":["Space Control and Inertial Technology Research Center, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China"],"firstName":"Lixian","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37406065300"},{"name":"Peng Shi","affiliation":["Institute of Logistics and Supply Chain Management, School of Computer Science and Mathematics, Victoria University, Melbourne, VIC, Australia","Australia and the School of Mathematics and Statistics, University of South Australia, Adelaide, Australia","Faculty of Advanced Technology, University of Glamorgan, Pontypridd, UK"],"firstName":"Peng","lastName":"Shi","id":"37287152000"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9286"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2523"},{"format":"CD","value":"2334-3303"}],"articleNumber":"4668536","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":178,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1295},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Control Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieeecss.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Symmetric matrices","Vectors","Switched systems","Lyapunov method","Sampling methods","Stability criteria","Linear systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["control system analysis","discrete time systems","linear matrix inequalities","linear systems","reduced order systems","time-varying systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["model reduction","discrete time switched linear parameter varying systems","average dwell time switching","parameterized reduced model","LMI formulation","model error system","exponential stability","error performance","linear matrix inequalities"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Average dwell time","linear matrix inequalities (LMIs)","model reduction","switched linear systems","time-varying parameters"]}],"abstract":"In this note, the model reduction problem for a class of discrete-time switched linear parameter varying systems under average dwell time switching is investigated.

A numerical example is used to illustrate the developed theory.","doi":"10.1109/TAC.2008.2007867","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","pdfPath":"/iel5/9/4668472/04668537.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAC.2008.2007867","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4668472","startPage":"2458","endPage":"2464","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis and Synthesis of Markov Jump Linear Systems With Time-Varying Delays and Partially Known Transition Probabilities","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4668537","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Analysis and Synthesis of Markov Jump Linear Systems With Time-Varying Delays and Partially Known Transition Probabilities","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4668537/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 November 2008","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"53","issue":"10","publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","accessionNumber":"10291361","dateOfInsertion":"07 November 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4668537/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis and Synthesis of Markov Jump Linear Systems With Time-Varying Delays and Partially Known Transition Probabilities","sourcePdf":"tac-zhang-2007867.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.04615S","chronDate":"Nov.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"9","isNumber":"4668472","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9","citationCount":"399","xplore-issue":"4668472","articleId":"4668537","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-19"},{"_id":4668538,"authors":[{"name":"Robert C.

In such systems, it is optimal to simultaneously transmit to multiple users compared with a single user in a single-input-single-output system. In addition, multicarrier systems are of interest to combat frequency-selective fading that is experienced over the larger bandwidth that these future broadband systems will use. The use of dirty paper coding further complicates the matter, because the order in which the users are encoded will affect the rates that they can achieve. A well-designed cross-layer scheduling algorithm must take into account the multiple dimensions of this resource-allocation problem and other quality-of-service (QoS) parameters to fully exploit the communications channel. The scheduling problem is often expressed in terms of optimizing some utility function. Unfortunately, the search space for this optimization problem is extremely large, which prohibits an optimal exhaustive search. To this end, we investigate the use of genetic algorithms to reduce the complexity of the scheduling. This paper builds upon prior work that implements scheduling via genetic algorithms in the context of single-carrier systems using zero-forcing beamforming (ZFB). In this paper, we investigate how the genetic algorithm can be adapted to account for the effect of encoding order on the scheduling and how the scheduling can be extended to a multicarrier system. In particular, we investigate the maximum throughput and proportionally fair scheduling criteria. We demonstrate that the performance of the genetic algorithm is near optimal compared with an exhaustive search at a greatly reduced computational complexity. Furthermore, in the case of a multicarrier orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) system, an increase in capacity is shown relative to the single-carrier case.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4668538/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 November 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2009","volume":"58","issue":"7","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"18 August 2009","publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"10829094","htmlLink":"/document/4668538/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Downlink Scheduling via Genetic Algorithms for Multiuser Single-Carrier and Multicarrier MIMO Systems With Dirty Paper Coding","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Downlink Scheduling via Genetic Algorithms for Multiuser Single-Carrier and Multicarrier MIMO Systems With Dirty Paper Coding","sourcePdf":"tvt-krzymien-2009059.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.110111S","chronDate":"Sept.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"5204505","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"46","xplore-issue":"5204505","articleId":"4668538","onlineDate":"07 November 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4668539,"authors":[{"name":"Cheng-Nan Chiu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Da-Yeh University, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/15/4669925/4668539/4668539-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Cheng-Nan Chiu (M\u201902) received the B.S. degree in physics from the National Tsinghua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan, R.O.C., in 1990, and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from the National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan, in 1993 and 1996, respectively.","From 1996 to 1998, he was with Acer, Inc. and Tatung, Inc., Taipei.

Developments in nanowire growth have led to the demonstration of a wide range of nanowire materials with precise control of composition, morphology, and electrical properties, and it is believed that this excellent control together with small channel size could yield device performance exceeding that obtained using top-down techniques. Here, we review advances in chemically synthesized semiconductor nanowires as nanoelectronic devices. We first introduce basic nanowire field-effect transistor structures and review results obtained from both p- and n-channel homogeneous composition nanowires. Second, we describe nanowire heterostructures, show that by using nanowire heterostructures, several limiting factors in homogeneous nanowire devices can be mitigated, and demonstrate that nanowire transistor performance can reach the ballistic limit and exceed state-of-the-art planar devices. Third, we discuss basic methods for organization of nanowires necessary for fabricating arrays of device and circuits. Fourth, we introduce the concept of crossbar nanowire circuits, discuss results for both transistor and nonvolatile switch devices, and describe unique approaches for multiplexing/demultiplexing enabled by synthetically coded nanowire. Fifth, we discuss the unique application of thin-film nanowire transistor arrays on low-cost substrates and illustrate this with results for relatively high-frequency ring oscillators and completely transparent device arrays. Finally, we describe 3-D heterogeneous integration that is uniquely enabled by multifunctional nanowires within a bottom-up approach.","doi":"10.1109/TED.2008.2005158","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","pdfPath":"/iel5/16/4668541/04668552.pdf","startPage":"2859","endPage":"2876","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TED.2008.2005158","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4668541","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Nanowire Transistor Performance Limits and Applications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4668552","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 November 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4668552/","displayDocTitle":"Nanowire Transistor Performance Limits and Applications","volume":"55","issue":"11","publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","accessionNumber":"10311729","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4668552/","dateOfInsertion":"07 November 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Nanowire Transistor Performance Limits and Applications","sourcePdf":"ted-lieber-2005158.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.335063S","chronDate":"Nov.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"16","isNumber":"4668541","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"254","xplore-issue":"4668541","articleId":"4668552","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":4668579,"authors":[{"name":"Takashi Hirao","affiliation":["Research Institute for Nanodevices, Kochi University of Technology, Kochi, Japan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/16/4668541/4668579/4668579-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Takashi Hirao received the M.S. and D.E. degrees from Osaka University, Osaka, Japan, in 1967 and 1979, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree from Kanazawa University, Ishikawa, Japan, in 1989.","In 1967, he was with the Central Research Laboratory, Matsushita Electric Industrial Company, Ltd., where he was engaged in the research of material science and device applications.

We adopt a two-phase approach of i) channel estimation with training and ii) source estimation given the channel estimates and transmitted sensor observations, where the total power is fixed. In the second phase we consider both an equal power scheduling among sensors and an optimized choice of powers. We also optimize the percentage of total power that should be allotted for training. We prove that 50% training is optimal for equal power scheduling and at least 50% is needed for optimized power scheduling. For both equal and optimized cases, a power penalty of at least 6 dB is incurred compared to the perfect channel case to get the same mean squared error performance for the source estimator. However, the diversity order is shown to be unchanged in the presence of channel estimation error. In addition, we show that, unlike the perfect channel case, increasing the number of sensors will lead to an eventual degradation in performance. We approximate the optimum number of sensors as a function of the total power and noise statistics. Simulations corroborate our analytical findings.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4668624/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 November 2008","volume":"56","issue":"12","accessionNumber":"10313315","publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4668624/","dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2008","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Performance of Distributed Estimation Over Unknown Parallel Fading Channels","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance of Distributed Estimation Over Unknown Parallel Fading Channels","sourcePdf":"tsp-tepedelenlioglu-2005090.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.064758S","chronDate":"Dec.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"4668621","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"44","xplore-issue":"4668621","articleId":"4668624","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4668628,"authors":[{"name":"Cheng Jia","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Cheng Jia received the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from the Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, in 2005.","He is currently working in the areas of mixed signal design/testing and embedded hardware/software design."]},"firstName":"Cheng","lastName":"Jia","id":"37564666200"},{"name":"Linda Milor","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/92/4668626/4668628/4668628-photo-2-source-small.gif","p":["Linda Milor received the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from the University of California, Berkeley, in 1992.","She is currently an Associate Professor with the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta.

The conventional methods of SRAM stability estimation suffer from two major drawbacks: 1) using static failure criteria, such as static noise margin (SNM), which does not capture the transient and dynamic behavior of SRAM operation and 2) using quasi-Monte Carlo simulation, which approximates the failure distribution, resulting in large errors at the tails where the desired failure probabilities exist. These drawbacks are eliminated by employing a new distribution-independent, most-probable-failure-point search technique for accurate probability calculation along with accurate simulation-based dynamic failure criteria. Compared to previously published techniques, the proposed technique offers orders of magnitude improvement in accuracy. Furthermore, the proposed technique enables the correct evaluation of stability in real operation conditions and for different dynamic circuit techniques, such as dynamic write-back, where the conventional methods are not applicable.","doi":"10.1109/TVLSI.2008.2001941","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/92/4668626/04668629.pdf","startPage":"1639","endPage":"1647","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVLSI.2008.2001941","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4668626","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Accurate Estimation of SRAM Dynamic Stability","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4668629/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 November 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2008","displayDocTitle":"Accurate Estimation of SRAM Dynamic Stability","volume":"16","issue":"12","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","accessionNumber":"10313295","htmlLink":"/document/4668629/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Accurate Estimation of SRAM Dynamic Stability","sourcePdf":"16tvlsi10-dkhalil-2001941.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.06891S","chronDate":"Dec.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"92","isNumber":"4668626","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"58","xplore-issue":"4668626","articleId":"4668629","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4668632,"authors":[{"name":"Ignacio Bravo","affiliation":["Electronics Department, University of Alcala, Madrid, Spain"],"firstName":"Ignacio","lastName":"Bravo","id":"37300335600"},{"name":"Manuel Mazo","affiliation":["Electronics Department, University of Alcala, Madrid, Spain"],"firstName":"Manuel","lastName":"Mazo","id":"37283418800"},{"name":"Jos\u00c9 Luis Lazaro","affiliation":["Electronics Department, University of Alcala, Madrid, Spain"],"firstName":"Jos\u00c9 Luis","lastName":"Lazaro","id":"37279807200"},{"name":"Pedro Jimenez","affiliation":["Electronics Department, University of Alcala, Madrid, Spain"],"firstName":"Pedro","lastName":"Jimenez","id":"37300333000"},{"name":"Alfredo Gardel","affiliation":["Electronics Department, University of Alcala, Madrid, Spain"],"firstName":"Alfredo","lastName":"Gardel","id":"37300336700"},{"name":"Marta Marron","affiliation":["Electronics Department, University of Alcala, Madrid, Spain"],"firstName":"Marta","lastName":"Marron","id":"37297231300"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-8210"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9999"}],"articleNumber":"4668632","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":33,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":661},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Circuits and Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieee-cas.org/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computer Society","url":"http://www.computer.org/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Solid-State Circuits Society","url":"http://www.sscs.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Field programmable gate arrays","Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","Jacobian matrices","Covariance matrix","Principal component analysis","Hardware","Proposals","Matrix decomposition","Computer architecture","Application software"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer architecture","eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","field programmable gate arrays","Jacobian matrices","principal component analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["HW architecture","FPGA","eigenvalues","eigenvectors","symmetrical matrix","principal component analysis","Jacobi method"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["CORDIC","eigenvalue","eigenvector","field-programmable gate array (FPGA)"]}],"abstract":"A hardware solution is presented to obtain the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a real and symmetrical matrix using field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs).

These advantages can be achieved only with good synchronization both in time and frequency. This paper proposes new efficient synchronization methods for an OFDM-based system, IEEE 802.16d. For the coarse time synchronization and the fractional carrier frequency offset (CFO) estimation, a disjoint architecture is proposed that performs auto-correlations separately to achieve more reliable frequency synchronization and to reduce overall hardware complexity and power consumption. In addition, for the fine symbol timing offset (STO) and the integer CFO, a new joint estimation method employing parallel cross-correlations between the received samples and the pre-rotated training sequences is proposed. Experimental results show significantly superior performance to the previous synchronization methods. A prototype synchronizer based on the proposed methods is designed with a 0.25-mum CMOS process, which reduces power consumption by more than 60% compared to a conventional synchronizer.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Low-Power and High-Accurate Synchronization for IEEE 802.16d Systems","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","doi":"10.1109/TVLSI.2008.2001567","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/92/4668626/04668641.pdf","startPage":"1620","endPage":"1630","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVLSI.2008.2001567","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4668626","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4668641","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4668641/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 November 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2008","displayDocTitle":"Low-Power and High-Accurate Synchronization for IEEE 802.16d Systems","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"16","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/4668641/","dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2008","publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","accessionNumber":"10313307","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low-Power and High-Accurate Synchronization for IEEE 802.16d Systems","sourcePdf":"tvlsi-kim-2001567.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.09046S","chronDate":"Dec.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"92","isNumber":"4668626","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"4668626","articleId":"4668641","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4668645,"authors":[{"name":"Shih-Hau Fang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Graduate Institute of Communication Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Shih-Hau","lastName":"Fang","id":"37401406900"},{"name":"Tsung-Nan Lin","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Graduate Institute of Communication Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Tsung-Nan","lastName":"Lin","id":"37278074700"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1045-9227"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0093"}],"articleNumber":"4668645","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":161,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":2458},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computational Intelligence Society","url":"http://ieee-cis.org/"}],"abstract":"This brief paper presents a novel localization algorithm, named discriminant-adaptive neural network (DANN), which takes the received signal strength (RSS) from the access points (APs) as inputs to infer the client position in the wireless local area network (LAN) environment.

The nonlinear relationship between RSS and the position is then accurately constructed by incrementally inserting the DCs and recursively updating the weightings in the network until no further improvement is required.

The experimental results indicate that the proposed algorithm is much higher in accuracy compared with other examined techniques. The improvement can be attributed to that only the useful information is efficiently extracted for positioning while the redundant information is regarded as noise and discarded.

The individual neural network is subject to parameter uncertainty, stochastic disturbance, and time-varying delay, where the norm-bounded parameter uncertainties exist in both the state and weight matrices, the stochastic disturbance is in the form of a scalar Wiener process, and the time delay enters into the activation function. For the array of coupled neural networks, the constant coupling and delayed coupling are simultaneously considered. We aim to establish easy-to-verify conditions under which the addressed neural networks are synchronized. By using the Kronecker product as an effective tool, a linear matrix inequality (LMI) approach is developed to derive several sufficient criteria ensuring the coupled delayed neural networks to be globally, robustly, exponentially synchronized in the mean square. The LMI-based conditions obtained are dependent not only on the lower bound but also on the upper bound of the time-varying delay, and can be solved efficiently via the Matlab LMI Toolbox. Two numerical examples are given to demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed synchronization scheme.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robust Synchronization of an Array of Coupled Stochastic Discrete-Time Delayed Neural Networks","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","doi":"10.1109/TNN.2008.2003250","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/72/4666767/04668646.pdf","startPage":"1910","endPage":"1921","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNN.2008.2003250","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4666767","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4668646","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4668646/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 November 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2008","displayDocTitle":"Robust Synchronization of an Array of Coupled Stochastic Discrete-Time Delayed Neural Networks","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"19","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/4668646/","dateOfInsertion":"07 November 2008","publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","accessionNumber":"10495671","pubMedId":"19000962","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust Synchronization of an Array of Coupled Stochastic Discrete-Time Delayed Neural Networks","sourcePdf":"tnn-wang-2003250.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.086616S","chronDate":"Nov.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"72","isNumber":"4666767","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"72","citationCount":"166","xplore-issue":"4666767","articleId":"4668646","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"USGov","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4668662,"authors":[{"name":"Umut Ozertem","affiliation":["Yahoo, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Umut","lastName":"Ozertem","id":"37322494700"},{"name":"Ismail Uysal","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, University of florida, Gainesville, FL, USA"],"firstName":"Ismail","lastName":"Uysal","id":"37396825300"},{"name":"Deniz Erdogmus","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, Northeastern University, Boston, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Deniz","lastName":"Erdogmus","id":"37285051800"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1045-9227"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0093"}],"articleNumber":"4668662","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":10,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":358},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computational Intelligence Society","url":"http://ieee-cis.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Entropy","Higher order statistics","Error analysis","Kernel","Yield estimation","Information theory","Machine learning","Adaptive signal processing","Adaptive systems","Computational complexity"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive estimation","adaptive systems","computational complexity","correlation methods","error statistics","higher order statistics","learning (artificial intelligence)","minimum entropy methods","sampling methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["continuously differentiable sample-spacing nonparametric entropy estimation","higher order statistic","information theory","error entropy minimization","machine learning","signal processing","adaptive system training","correlation-estimation-based second-order statistic","kernel density estimation-based kernel estimator","gradient-based adaptation","computational complexity","supervised neural network training framework"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Entropy estimation","minimum error entropy (MEE) criterion","supervised neural network training"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Algorithms","Computer Simulation","Data Interpretation, Statistical","Entropy","Models, Theoretical","Neural Networks (Computer)","Pattern Recognition, Automated","Sample Size"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4668662","doi":"10.1109/TNN.2008.2006167","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNN.2008.2006167","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4666767","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/72/4666767/04668662.pdf","startPage":"1978","endPage":"1984","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Continuously Differentiable Sample-Spacing Entropy Estimation","abstract":"The insufficiency of using only second-order statistics and premise of exploiting higher order statistics of the data has been well understood, and more advanced objectives including higher order statistics, especially those stemming from information theory, such as error entropy minimization, are now being studied and applied in many contexts of machine learning and signal processing. In the adaptive system training context, the main drawback of utilizing output error entropy as compared to correlation-estimation-based second-order statistics is the computational load of the entropy estimation, which is usually obtained via a plug-in kernel estimator. Sample-spacing estimates offer computationally inexpensive entropy estimators; however, resulting estimates are not differentiable, hence, not suitable for gradient-based adaptation. In this brief paper, we propose a nonparametric entropy estimator that captures the desirable properties of both approaches. The resulting estimator yields continuously differentiable estimates with a computational complexity at the order of those of the sample-spacing techniques.

When two or more adjacent spectral lines are too close, many spectrum estimation algorithms fail to distinguish these frequency components. A modified high-resolution singular value decomposition (SVD) method for power quality signal analysis by using down-sampling technique is proposed in this paper. With adopting down-sampling technique, a scaling factor is introduced to separate the spectral lines from each other, and then the correct spectra can be estimated. The performance of the proposed method is validated by testing the actual measured signal. Results are compared with those obtained from several FFT-based and SVD methods, and the commercialized power quality meter. It shows that the proposed method can precisely detect the frequency components of the measured power signal with a high resolution.","doi":"10.1109/ICHQP.2008.4668751","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICHQP.2008.4668751","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 13th International Conference on Harmonics and Quality of Power","pdfPath":"/iel5/4662486/4668740/04668751.pdf","publicationTitle":"2008 13th International Conference on Harmonics and Quality of Power","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4668740","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Modified high-resolution Singular Value Decomposition method for power signal analysis by using down-sampling technique","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 28 2008-Oct. 1 2008","displayDocTitle":"Modified high-resolution Singular Value Decomposition method for power signal analysis by using down-sampling technique","conferenceDate":"28 Sept.-1 Oct. 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"07 November 2008","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4668751/","accessionNumber":"10389851","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4668751/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modified high-resolution Singular Value Decomposition method for power signal analysis by using down-sampling technique","confLoc":"Wollongong, NSW, Australia","sourcePdf":"SPI-11032008-00011.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046533S","chronDate":"Sept. 28 2008-Oct. 1 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4662486","isNumber":"4668740","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4662486","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4668740","articleId":"4668751","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4668759,"authors":[{"name":"Alexandre B.

Compact fluorescent lamps (CFLs) are expected to replace incandescent bulbs as they consume comparatively less energy and their useful life is longer. However, compact fluorescent lamps absorb extremely distorted current waveforms, resulting in high current harmonic injections on the electrical grid. Like other electronic devices based on single-phase rectification, CFLs are susceptible to the attenuation effect. If this effect is not taken into consideration, the cumulative harmonic current produced by the lamps can be significantly overestimated and the results obtained using the current-source model can be too conservative to be useful. This paper focuses on the harmonic characterization of modern compact fluorescent lamps. It presents experimental analysis investigation on the attenuation effect of CFLs, which is caused by the influence of distorted supply voltage on nonlinear load harmonic current injections.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4668740","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICHQP.2008.4668759","publicationTitle":"2008 13th International Conference on Harmonics and Quality of Power","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 13th International Conference on Harmonics and Quality of Power","pdfPath":"/iel5/4662486/4668740/04668759.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doi":"10.1109/ICHQP.2008.4668759","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An investigation on the harmonic attenuation effect of modern compact fluorescent lamps","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 28 2008-Oct. 1 2008","displayDocTitle":"An investigation on the harmonic attenuation effect of modern compact fluorescent lamps","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"28 Sept.-1 Oct. 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4668759/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2008","accessionNumber":"10389856","dateOfInsertion":"07 November 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4668759/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An investigation on the harmonic attenuation effect of modern compact fluorescent lamps","confLoc":"Wollongong, NSW, Australia","sourcePdf":"SPI-11032008-00019.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057735S","chronDate":"Sept. 28 2008-Oct. 1 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4662486","isNumber":"4668740","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4662486","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"4668740","articleId":"4668759","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4668761,"authors":[{"name":"G.

Therefore a growing number of voltage quality monitoring campaigns with continuously increasing measurement times, considerably longer than one week, are observed. The assessment of voltage quality according to common standards (e.g. IEC 61000-2-x or EN 50160) is usually based on an evaluation interval of one week while the handling of measurements lasting more than a week is not clearly specified. Furthermore the measurement data contain lots of information that is not used by the actual applied assessment methods in the most efficient way. Especially for internal planning purposes within the utilities the knowledge of medium- and long-term trends and variations as well as information about the typical time-dependent customer behavior can be very useful. The paper presents a method that includes medium- and long- term variations (e.g. seasonal variations) of continuous voltage quality parameters (e.g. harmonics) into the calculation of actual levels. The method is based on statistical tolerance bounds and produces more reliable values that can be compared with limits given by actual standards or used for further analyses. After a description of actual assessment methods the paper gives a systematical overview on the variations of voltage quality parameters and typical reasons for that. Next the statistical basics are explained on several examples. Based on the experiences of the authors finally some recommendations for practical application of the suggested method are given.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 28 2008-Oct. 1 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4668787/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"10393372","publicationDate":"Sept. 2008","conferenceDate":"28 Sept.-1 Oct. 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4668787/","dateOfInsertion":"07 November 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Increasing the reliability of indices for power quality assessment in distribution networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Increasing the reliability of indices for power quality assessment in distribution networks","confLoc":"Wollongong, NSW, Australia","sourcePdf":"SPI-11032008-00047.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045004S","chronDate":"Sept. 28 2008-Oct. 1 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4662486","isNumber":"4668740","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4662486","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"4668740","articleId":"4668787","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4668792,"authors":[{"name":"Geoffrey N.

The Harmonic State Space model, in which harmonics of state variables, inputs and outputs are posed separately in a State Space form, can be used for dynamic small signal studies, and for harmonic steady state studies. The technique can handle autonomous switches such as diodes, and controlled switches such as IGBTs and GTOs. The technique is demonstrated by modeling a Buck-Boost converter. The HSS of the Buck-Boost converter is compared to a PSCAD-EMTDC model. This is presented as a demonstration of a general technique that is extendable to common HVdc and FACTs device modeling.","doi":"10.1109/ICHQP.2008.4668792","publicationTitle":"2008 13th International Conference on Harmonics and Quality of Power","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 13th International Conference on Harmonics and Quality of Power","pdfPath":"/iel5/4662486/4668740/04668792.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICHQP.2008.4668792","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4668740","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Harmonic State Space model of power electronics","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4668792","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 28 2008-Oct. 1 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4668792/","displayDocTitle":"Harmonic State Space model of power electronics","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2008","accessionNumber":"10389876","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4668792/","conferenceDate":"28 Sept.-1 Oct. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"07 November 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Harmonic State Space model of power electronics","confLoc":"Wollongong, NSW, Australia","sourcePdf":"SPI-11032008-00052.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.038625S","chronDate":"Sept. 28 2008-Oct. 1 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4662486","isNumber":"4668740","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4662486","citationCount":"33","xplore-issue":"4668740","articleId":"4668792","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":4668810,"authors":[{"name":"S.

This is a relevant problem in weak networks and, in particular, under resonant conditions. The long history of minimization of negative effects due to distorted currents has encouraged researchers and designers to attempt different control strategies for electronic converters. In this paper, a new control for bidirectional converters is proposed, whose active power exchanged with the grid depends on the sinusoidal balanced current term. Whereas at harmonic frequencies and negative sequence the proposed control emulates a resistive behavior, a damping effect on disturbances is achieved. The proposed control is economically feasible within small DG-systems. Measurements at ac converter terminals are the only required. Moreover, differential treatment of fundamental positive-sequence current and the remaining components allows the same control strategy to be maintained over the whole working range.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4668834/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 28 2008-Oct. 1 2008","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"28 Sept.-1 Oct. 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4668834/","dateOfInsertion":"07 November 2008","publicationDate":"Sept. 2008","accessionNumber":"10389895","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Harmonic damping by means of DG front-end converter.

Because of the importance of power quality in industrial bus bars when the loads are numerous, the classic methods of control (because of inherent time delay) can not been used. Therefore the fuzzy controller has been developed to for compensation because of the fast and stable response to voltage alterations. Regarding the complexity of tuning of fuzzy controller, using the trial and error method to tune them is not acceptable; however the updated numerical methods should be used. To tune fuzzy controller, a professional personpsilas information or the systempsilas exact specific equation is needed and if this information is not available we should use the new methods of numerical methods. So we apply genetic algorithm that is a powerful researcher and in a determinant population for each person search the best point and promote these point simultaneously.","doi":"10.1109/ICHQP.2008.4668855","pdfPath":"/iel5/4662486/4668740/04668855.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 13th International Conference on Harmonics and Quality of Power","publicationTitle":"2008 13th International Conference on Harmonics and Quality of Power","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICHQP.2008.4668855","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4668740","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Complete, integrated and simultaneously design for STATCOM fuzzy controller with variable length genetic algorithm for voltage profile improvement","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4668855/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 28 2008-Oct. 1 2008","displayDocTitle":"Complete, integrated and simultaneously design for STATCOM fuzzy controller with variable length genetic algorithm for voltage profile improvement","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"07 November 2008","accessionNumber":"10389908","publicationDate":"Sept. 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4668855/","conferenceDate":"28 Sept.-1 Oct. 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Complete, integrated and simultaneously design for STATCOM fuzzy controller with variable length genetic algorithm for voltage profile improvement","confLoc":"Wollongong, NSW, Australia","sourcePdf":"SPI-11032008-00115.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048972S","chronDate":"Sept. 28 2008-Oct. 1 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4662486","isNumber":"4668740","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4662486","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4668740","articleId":"4668855","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4668905,"authors":[{"name":"Xu-ping Wang","affiliation":["Inst. of Syst.

Some scholars used BP neural network to forecast the short-term load, and they found it has the intrinsic defects. Itpsilas difficult to determine the network structure and it easily run into partial minimum points. Based on genetic algorithmpsilas strong global searching ability and BP neural networkpsilas accurate local searching ability, this paper proposes an adaptive hybrid genetic BP neural network algorithm. It uses genetic algorithm to optimize the BP network initial weight first, then uses the BP neural network to learn by itself according to the data given, to acquire an excellent load forecasting system. In the training of neural network, the over-fitting often appears which affects the result of forecasting. To prevent this problem, the entire data set is divided into training set and validation set randomly. This algorithm was used to predict the load of Sydney. Simulation results indicate that the algorithm improves the forecast accuracy and the performance of the network.","doi":"10.1109/ICMSE.2008.4669113","startPage":"1563","endPage":"1568","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Management Science and Engineering 15th Annual Conference Proceedings","pdfPath":"/iel5/4662553/4668876/04669113.pdf","publicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Management Science and Engineering 15th Annual Conference Proceedings","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMSE.2008.4669113","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4668876","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Research on short-term load forecasting based on adaptive hybrid genetic optimization BP neural network algorithm","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Load forecasting","Genetics","Neural networks","Weather forecasting","Predictive models","Economic forecasting","Load modeling","Fuzzy neural networks","Artificial neural networks","Power system security"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["backpropagation","electricity supply industry","genetic algorithms","load forecasting","neural nets","search problems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["short-term load forecasting","adaptive hybrid genetic optimization","BP neural network algorithm","electricity system","global searching ability","local searching ability"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["adaptive hybrid genetic algorithm","BP neural network","over fitting","short-term load forecasting"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineering Profession"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4669113/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-12 Sept. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Research on short-term load forecasting based on adaptive hybrid genetic optimization BP neural network algorithm","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4669113/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"07 November 2008","conferenceDate":"10-12 Sept. 2008","accessionNumber":"10389533","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Research on short-term load forecasting based on adaptive hybrid genetic optimization BP neural network algorithm","confLoc":"Long Beach, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-11032008-00237.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063587S","chronDate":"10-12 Sept. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4662553","isNumber":"4668876","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4662553","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"4668876","articleId":"4669113","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4669217,"authors":[{"name":"Najam-ul-Islam Muhammad","affiliation":["Institute Eurecom, Sophia-Antipolis, France"],"firstName":"Najam-ul-Islam","lastName":"Muhammad","id":"37872742700"},{"name":"Rizwan Rasheed","affiliation":["TELECOM ParisTech-Institute Eurecom, Sophia-Antipolis, France"],"firstName":"Rizwan","lastName":"Rasheed","id":"37884419900"},{"name":"Renaud Pacalet","affiliation":["TELECOM ParisTech-Institute Eurecom, Sophia-Antipolis, France"],"firstName":"Renaud","lastName":"Pacalet","id":"37388832900"},{"name":"Raymond Knopp","affiliation":["Institute Eurecom, Sophia-Antipolis, France"],"firstName":"Raymond","lastName":"Knopp","id":"37283390500"},{"name":"Karim Khalfallah","affiliation":["Institute Eurecom, Sophia-Antipolis, France"],"firstName":"Karim","lastName":"Khalfallah","id":"37870512800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3277-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4669217","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":234},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Baseband","Digital signal processing","Engines","Mobile communication","Access protocols","Hardware","Communication standards","Wireless communication","Frequency","Prototypes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mobile communication","radio access networks","radio spectrum management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["flexible baseband architecture","future wireless systems","mobile communication systems","radio spectrum","radio access technology","protocol stacks","flexible hardware platform","wireless communication frequency range","baseband prototype architecture","SDR applications","digital signal processing engine","configurable processing blocks"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["SDR","Hardware Architecture","Baseband Processing","HW/SW Partitioning","Open platforms for multistandard support","HW accelerators"]}],"abstract":"The mobile communication systems today, have different radio spectrum, radio access technologies, and protocol stacks depending on the network being utilized.

Through the JTRS program, the US Dept. of Defense proposed the SCA specification as the standard for military communications. The SDR Forum is now reviewing these specifications and trying to adapt them to the commercial market. The significant differences between military and commercial communications' requirements make this migration a hazardous task. On the other hand, the SCA specification does not consider any method or procedure that enables cognitive functionalities, which would be necessary for future cognitive radio implementations. This paper therefore presents an alternative approach to SCA, introducing a low-profile operating environment for next generation cognitive radios. We demonstrate its suitability for present and future commercial radios.","doi":"10.1109/DSD.2008.113","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 11th EUROMICRO Conference on Digital System Design Architectures, Methods and Tools","pdfPath":"/iel5/4669199/4669200/04669218.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4669200","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DSD.2008.113","publicationTitle":"2008 11th EUROMICRO Conference on Digital System Design Architectures, Methods and Tools","startPage":"47","endPage":"52","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Lightweight Operating Environment for Next Generation Cognitive Radios","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4669218","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 Sept. 2008","displayDocTitle":"A Lightweight Operating Environment for Next Generation Cognitive Radios","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4669218/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4669218/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"07 November 2008","conferenceDate":"3-5 Sept. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Lightweight Operating Environment for Next Generation Cognitive Radios","confLoc":"Parma, Italy","sourcePdf":"3277a047.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057111S","chronDate":"3-5 Sept. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4669199","isNumber":"4669200","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4669199","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4669200","articleId":"4669218","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4669224,"authors":[{"name":"Petr Fi\u0161er","affiliation":["Dept. of Computer Science and Engineering, Czech Technical University in Prague, Czech Republic"],"firstName":"Petr","lastName":"Fi\u0161er","id":"37086901237"},{"name":"Pavel Kubal\u00edk","affiliation":["Dept. of Computer Science and Engineering, Czech Technical University in Prague, Czech Republic"],"firstName":"Pavel","lastName":"Kubal\u00edk","id":"37594691200"},{"name":"Hana Kub\u00e1tov\u00e1","affiliation":["Dept. of Computer Science and Engineering, Czech Technical University in Prague, Czech Republic"],"firstName":"Hana","lastName":"Kub\u00e1tov\u00e1","id":"37267112600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3277-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4669224","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":95},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Efficient Multiple-Parity Generator Design for On-Line Testing on FPGA","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 11th EUROMICRO Conference on Digital System Design Architectures, Methods and Tools","pdfPath":"/iel5/4669199/4669200/04669224.pdf","startPage":"96","endPage":"99","publicationTitle":"2008 11th EUROMICRO Conference on Digital System Design Architectures, Methods and Tools","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DSD.2008.46","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4669200","doi":"10.1109/DSD.2008.46","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Field programmable gate arrays","Circuit testing","Error correction","Design methodology","Mission critical systems","Random access memory","Single event transient","Circuit faults","Minimization methods","Digital systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","network synthesis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiple-parity generator design","online testing","FPGA","XOR","FC-Min minimizer","self-checking circuit design","modified duplex system"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["BIST","parity generator","on-line testing","Boolean minimization"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4669224","abstract":"We propose a method to efficiently design a \"parity generator\", which is a stand-alone block producing multiple parity bits of a given circuit.

Emulation is performed in the user-selected area. Look-up-tables, cell interconnections, cell-to-bus connections and routing resources are considered. Other FPGA resources are not considered. Combinatorial circuits and MCNC benchmarks were measured due to our knowledge of FPGA resource limitation. All tests were performed on Atmel FPSLIC architecture.","doi":"10.1109/DSD.2008.119","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DSD.2008.119","publicationTitle":"2008 11th EUROMICRO Conference on Digital System Design Architectures, Methods and Tools","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 11th EUROMICRO Conference on Digital System Design Architectures, Methods and Tools","pdfPath":"/iel5/4669199/4669200/04669225.pdf","startPage":"100","endPage":"103","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4669200","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4669225/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 Sept. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Experimental SEU Impact on Digital Design Implemented in FPGAs","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"3-5 Sept. 2008","accessionNumber":"10396827","htmlLink":"/document/4669225/","dateOfInsertion":"07 November 2008","publicationDate":"Sept. 2008","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Experimental SEU Impact on Digital Design Implemented in FPGAs","confLoc":"Parma, Italy","sourcePdf":"3277a100.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.075161S","chronDate":"3-5 Sept. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4669199","isNumber":"4669200","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4669199","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4669200","articleId":"4669225","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4669230,"authors":[{"name":"Simone Secchi","affiliation":["DIEE-Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University of Cagliari, Cagliari, Italy"],"firstName":"Simone","lastName":"Secchi","id":"37393250400"},{"name":"Francesca Palumbo","affiliation":["DIEE-Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University of Cagliari, Cagliari, Italy"],"firstName":"Francesca","lastName":"Palumbo","id":"37529757800"},{"name":"Danilo Pani","affiliation":["DIEE-Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University of Cagliari, Cagliari, Italy"],"firstName":"Danilo","lastName":"Pani","id":"37540587600"},{"name":"Luigi Raffo","affiliation":["DIEE-Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University of Cagliari, Cagliari, Italy"],"firstName":"Luigi","lastName":"Raffo","id":"37299746700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3277-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4669230","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":91},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Network-on-a-chip","Telecommunication traffic","Traffic control","Packet switching","Multicore processing","Integrated circuit interconnections","Very large scale integration","Turning","Switching circuits","Throughput"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["circuit switching","microprocessor chips","multiprocessor interconnection networks","network-on-chip","packet switching","VLSI"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["network-on-chip architecture","heterogeneous traffic support","nonexclusive dual-mode switching","multi-core processors","interconnection layer efficiency","VLSI technologies","dual-mode routers","packet switching","circuit switching","multi-processor system-on-chip","massively parallel processors","processor arrays"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Networks on Chip","Dual-mode switching","Non-exclusive switching","Circuit switching","Heterogeneous Traffic"]}],"abstract":"As the multi-core processors era took place, several design concerns have risen. Interconnection layer efficiency has gained particular relevance as a crucial issue to be addressed in order to leverage the large amount of on-chip resources that today's VLSI technologies are able to provide. At the same time, as the architectural parallelism will continue to grow and become more fine-grained, the kind of traffic generated by the different multithreaded applications is turning out to be very wide-ranging in terms of size and burstiness. In order to adapt to this large variety of traffic to be supported, several models of dual-mode routers have been developed, implementing both packet switching and circuit switching techniques, thus supporting both best effort and guaranteed throughput services. This paper introduces an innovative model of non-exclusive dual-mode router, able to combine the aforementioned features in a non exclusive way (i.e.: in parallel inside the network on the same link). This feature makes this NoC architecture well-suited for multi-processor system on-chip (MPSoC) architectures with a high level of parallelism which have to deal with heterogeneous traffic conditions, such as massively parallel processors (MPPs) and processor arrays (PAs).","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Network on Chip Architecture for Heterogeneous Traffic Support with Non-Exclusive Dual-Mode Switching","publicationTitle":"2008 11th EUROMICRO Conference on Digital System Design Architectures, Methods and Tools","doi":"10.1109/DSD.2008.64","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 11th EUROMICRO Conference on Digital System Design Architectures, Methods and Tools","pdfPath":"/iel5/4669199/4669200/04669230.pdf","startPage":"141","endPage":"148","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DSD.2008.64","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4669200","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4669230","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4669230/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 Sept. 2008","displayDocTitle":"A Network on Chip Architecture for Heterogeneous Traffic Support with Non-Exclusive Dual-Mode Switching","conferenceDate":"3-5 Sept. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4669230/","dateOfInsertion":"07 November 2008","publicationDate":"Sept. 2008","accessionNumber":"10396831","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Network on Chip Architecture for Heterogeneous Traffic Support with Non-Exclusive Dual-Mode Switching","confLoc":"Parma, Italy","sourcePdf":"3277a141.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042016S","chronDate":"3-5 Sept. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4669199","isNumber":"4669200","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4669199","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4669200","articleId":"4669230","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":4669235,"authors":[{"name":"Nuno Sebasti\u00e3o","affiliation":["INESC-ID, Lisboa, Portugal"],"firstName":"Nuno","lastName":"Sebasti\u00e3o","id":"37548022000"},{"name":"Tiago Dias","affiliation":["ISEL-PI Lisbon, Lisboa, Portugal","INESC-ID, Lisboa, Portugal"],"firstName":"Tiago","lastName":"Dias","id":"37528420900"},{"name":"Nuno Roma","affiliation":["INESC-ID, Lisboa, Portugal","Technical University of Lisbon, IST, Lisboa, Portugal"],"firstName":"Nuno","lastName":"Roma","id":"37331027900"},{"name":"Paulo Flores","affiliation":["INESC-ID, Lisboa, Portugal","Technical University of Lisbon, IST, Lisboa, Portugal"],"firstName":"Paulo","lastName":"Flores","id":"37368953600"},{"name":"Leonel Sousa","affiliation":["INESC-ID, Lisboa, Portugal","Technical University of Lisbon, IST, Lisboa, Portugal"],"firstName":"Leonel","lastName":"Sousa","id":"37265872100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3277-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4669235","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":63},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Motion estimation","Coprocessors","Design methodology","Application specific integrated circuits","Video coding","Automatic voltage control","Digital systems","Encoding","Performance analysis","CMOS technology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["application specific integrated circuits","CMOS integrated circuits","embedded systems","field programmable gate arrays","motion estimation","performance evaluation","video coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["application specific programmable IP core","motion estimation coprocessor","embedded co-processing unit","video encoding system","performance analysis","FPGA device","Xilinx Virtex-II Pro family","ASIC","CMOS StdCell library","size 0.18 mum"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Programmable co-processor","Application specific processor","Embedded system","Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA)","Application Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC)","Motion Estimation (ME)"]}],"abstract":"The implementation of a recently proposed IP core of an efficient motion estimation co-processor is considered.

In this paper, we present a technique for online testing of digital designs implemented on an FPGA. The approach enables application-oriented testing, in that it covers the subset of the FPGA which is actually used for the implemented design, and considers scenarios where the FPGA component is a part of a larger embedded system. The proposed approach is in fact based on a software framework, which acts as an abstraction layer for reconfigurable hardware resources. Essentially, the framework exposes to software applications a Register-Transfer Level view of the underlying hardware, allowing test procedures to be implemented as software programs. Our approach is especially advantageous when memory is a constraint, the case of many embedded systems. As proved by experimental results, in fact, test procedures turn out to be very compact and much more memory-efficient than conventional approaches relying on static sets of FPGA testing configurations to be stored in system memory.","doi":"10.1109/DSD.2008.102","publicationTitle":"2008 11th EUROMICRO Conference on Digital System Design Architectures, Methods and Tools","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 11th EUROMICRO Conference on Digital System Design Architectures, Methods and Tools","pdfPath":"/iel5/4669199/4669200/04669257.pdf","startPage":"360","endPage":"366","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4669200","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DSD.2008.102","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Virtual Scan Chains for Online Testing of FPGA-based Embedded Systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4669257/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 Sept. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Virtual Scan Chains for Online Testing of FPGA-based Embedded Systems","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4669257/","dateOfInsertion":"07 November 2008","publicationDate":"Sept. 2008","conferenceDate":"3-5 Sept. 2008","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Virtual Scan Chains for Online Testing of FPGA-based Embedded Systems","confLoc":"Parma, Italy","sourcePdf":"3277a360.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068074S","chronDate":"3-5 Sept. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4669199","isNumber":"4669200","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4669199","xplore-issue":"4669200","articleId":"4669257","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4669258,"authors":[{"name":"Tommaso Cecchini","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering, University of Pisa, Pisa, Italy"],"firstName":"Tommaso","lastName":"Cecchini","id":"37671415400"},{"name":"Francesco Sechi","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering, University of Pisa, Pisa, Italy"],"firstName":"Francesco","lastName":"Sechi","id":"37680777600"},{"name":"Luca Bacciarelli","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering, University of Pisa, Pisa, Italy"],"firstName":"Luca","lastName":"Bacciarelli","id":"37644291500"},{"name":"Luca Mostardini","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering, University of Pisa, Pisa, Italy"],"firstName":"Luca","lastName":"Mostardini","id":"37670589200"},{"name":"Francesco Battini","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering, University of Pisa, Pisa, Italy"],"firstName":"Francesco","lastName":"Battini","id":"37635946300"},{"name":"Luca Fanucci","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering, University of Pisa, Pisa, Italy"],"firstName":"Luca","lastName":"Fanucci","id":"37265849900"},{"name":"Marco De Marinis","affiliation":["Sensor Dynamics A.G., Polo Tecnol. - Navacchio, Pisa"],"firstName":"Marco","lastName":"De Marinis","id":"37352244400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3277-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4669258","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":104},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Pin-limited Frequency Downscaler AHB Bridge for ASIC to FPGA Communication","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 11th EUROMICRO Conference on Digital System Design Architectures, Methods and Tools","pdfPath":"/iel5/4669199/4669200/04669258.pdf","startPage":"367","endPage":"372","publicationTitle":"2008 11th EUROMICRO Conference on Digital System Design Architectures, Methods and Tools","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DSD.2008.56","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4669200","doi":"10.1109/DSD.2008.56","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Application specific integrated circuits","Field programmable gate arrays","Sensor systems","Pins","Frequency conversion","Protocols","Digital systems","Bridge circuits","Electronics packaging","Clocks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["application specific integrated circuits","field programmable gate arrays","system-on-chip"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["pin-limited frequency downscaler AHB bridge","ASIC","FPGA communication","mixed-signal IC","frequency reduction","system on programmable chip","bisynchronous FIFO structures","frequency conversion","custom protocol"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["bridge","ahb","asic","fpga","communication","bisynchronous"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4669258","abstract":"Output connections to out-of-chip devices in modern mixed-signal ICs represent a significant design problem due to the limited number of available pins (in not Ball Grid Array package) and to the common need of a frequency reduction, especially into systems that require an external System on Programmable Chip (SoPC).

The proposed bridge involves a custom protocol for the conversion of the transmitted data in low frequency and low width bus. Moreover, it allows managing data transmission with two different priority levels. The module is AHB lite compliant with a number of pins equal to the width of the FIFOs (configurable during implementation phase) and two handshaking signals.

The proposed technique aims at efficiently profiling the target application and deriving an approximated Pareto set of system configurations with respect to the selected figures of merit. Once the approximated Pareto set has been built, the designer can quickly select the best system configuration satisfying the constraints.

In these areas the research effort is actually aimed at finding an efficient implementation of geometric algebra. The best way to exploit the symbolic computing power of geometric algebra is to support its data types and operators directly in hardware. However the natural representation of the algebra elements as variable-length objects causes some problems in the case of a hardware implementation. This paper proposes a 4D Clifford algebra in which the variable-length elements are mapped into fixed-length elements (quadruples).

A very recent method for directly comparing the magnitude of two numbers represented in residue number systems (RNS) leads to the possibility of using modular arithmetic to compute the SAD. In this paper we propose an efficient hardware SAD unit that computes this Manhattan distance independently of each RNS channel. Therefore, the processing time can be reduced by simultaneously exploiting the carry-free characteristic of the modular arithmetic and the new method proposed by the authors of this paper to compare the magnitude of numbers in RNS. The proposed architecture is suitable to implement SAD units in application specific integrated circuit (ASIC) and in field programmable gate array (FPGA). In order to evaluate the performance of the proposed structures a hardware processor for computing the minimum SAD was implemented in a FPGA and ASIC. From the experimental results it was possible to obtain operating frequencies above 200 MHz for XILINX FPGAs XC2VP50-7 and XC4VLX80-12, and 300 MHz for the ASIC implementation. These results allow the implementation of real-time motion estimators for high resolution images according to the most recent standards for video coding.","doi":"10.1109/DSD.2008.107","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DSD.2008.107","startPage":"768","endPage":"775","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 11th EUROMICRO Conference on Digital System Design Architectures, Methods and Tools","pdfPath":"/iel5/4669199/4669200/04669314.pdf","publicationTitle":"2008 11th EUROMICRO Conference on Digital System Design Architectures, Methods and Tools","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4669200","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An RNS based Specific Processor for Computing the Minimum Sum-of-Absolute-Differences","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 Sept. 2008","displayDocTitle":"An RNS based Specific Processor for Computing the Minimum Sum-of-Absolute-Differences","conferenceDate":"3-5 Sept. 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"07 November 2008","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4669314/","accessionNumber":"10396906","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4669314/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An RNS based Specific Processor for Computing the Minimum Sum-of-Absolute-Differences","confLoc":"Parma, Italy","sourcePdf":"3277a768.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070262S","chronDate":"3-5 Sept. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4669199","isNumber":"4669200","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4669199","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"4669200","articleId":"4669314","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4669332,"authors":[{"name":"Shahid Mehmood","affiliation":["Centre for Advanced Studies in Engineering, Islamabad, Pakistan"],"firstName":"Shahid","lastName":"Mehmood","id":"38528679700"},{"name":"Stefano Cagnoni","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering, University of Parma, Italy"],"firstName":"Stefano","lastName":"Cagnoni","id":"37427627900"},{"name":"Monica Mordonini","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering, University of Parma, Italy"],"firstName":"Monica","lastName":"Mordonini","id":"37427627700"},{"name":"Guido Matrella","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering, University of Parma, Italy"],"firstName":"Guido","lastName":"Matrella","id":"37269291800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3277-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4669332","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":104},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Particle swarm optimization","Object detection","Hardware","Design engineering","Birds","Digital systems","Design methodology","Algorithm design and analysis","High performance computing","Field programmable gate arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","high level languages","object detection","particle swarm optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["particle swarm optimization","object detection","hardware-oriented adaptation","high-level language","FPGA","problem-dependent fitness function"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Particle Swarm Optimization","Object Detection","FPGA"]}],"abstract":"In this paper we propose a simplified, hardware-oriented algorithm for object detection, based on particle swarm optimization.

Estimating the manpower required by new projects and guaranteeing the quality of software are particularly important, because the estimation relates directly to costs while the quality reflects on the reliability of the corporations. In the field of embedded software, development techniques, management techniques, tools, testing techniques, reuse techniques, real-time operating systems and so on, have already been studied. However, there is little research on the relationship between the scale of the development and the number of errors using data accumulated from past projects. Hence, we integrate the previous models and establish a new model using an artificial neural network (ANN). We also compare the accuracy of the ANN model and the regression analysis models.

The 24 bits/pixel RGB images are used and the watermark is placed on the green channel of the RGB image. The green channel is chosen after an analytical investigation process was carried out using some popular measurement metrics. The analysis and embedding processes have been carried out using the discrete cosine transform DCT. The new watermarking method has shown to be resistant to JPEG compression, cropping, scaling, low-pass, median and removal attack. This algorithm produces more than 65 dB of average PSNR.","doi":"10.1109/MICCCA.2008.4669845","publicationTitle":"2008 Mosharaka International Conference on Communications, Computers and Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 Mosharaka International Conference on Communications, Computers and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4660002/4669828/04669845.pdf","startPage":"26","endPage":"31","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MICCCA.2008.4669845","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4669828","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A novel blind image watermarking technique for colour RGB images in the DCT domain using green channel","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A novel blind image watermarking technique for colour RGB images in the DCT domain using green channel","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"11 November 2008","accessionNumber":"10388603","publicationDate":"Aug. 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4669845/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4669845/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 Aug. 2008","conferenceDate":"8-10 Aug. 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A novel blind image watermarking technique for colour RGB images in the DCT domain using green channel","confLoc":"Amman, Jordan","sourcePdf":"SPI-11062008-00017.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053232S","chronDate":"8-10 Aug. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4660002","isNumber":"4669828","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4660002","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"4669828","articleId":"4669845","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Mosharaka for Researches","lastupdate":"2021-08-15"},{"_id":4669849,"authors":[{"name":"Jianmin Gong","affiliation":["Faculty of Information Science and Technology, Jinan University, Guangzhou, P.R.China"],"firstName":"Jianmin","lastName":"Gong","id":"37556510900"},{"name":"Chongchun Liu","affiliation":["Faculty of Information Science and Technology, Jinan University, Guangzhou, 510632, China"],"firstName":"Chongchun","lastName":"Liu","id":"37880607700"},{"name":"M.

The correlation is caused by the interaction of statistical distribution of incident waves around a receiver and the pattern of receive antennas. We derive a zero correlation condition matrix to the MIMO system based on the received electric signals. To find how to approach the zero correlation condition, we study the effect of antenna pattern and antenna array configuration in a realistic micro-cell environment. In the environment, the probability density function of the angle-of-arrival of incoming waves is modeled as studentpsilas t-distribution. Two types of receive antennas under study are half-wave dipole antennas and half-wave square microstrip patch antennas. It is found that the type of patch antennas has lower correlation and thus higher information-theoretical capacity than the type of dipole antennas in the environment.","doi":"10.1109/MICCCA.2008.4669850","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 Mosharaka International Conference on Communications, Computers and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4660002/4669828/04669850.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4669828","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MICCCA.2008.4669850","publicationTitle":"2008 Mosharaka International Conference on Communications, Computers and Applications","startPage":"54","endPage":"58","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Zero correlation matrix of a MIMO system and its application","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4669850","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 Aug. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Zero correlation matrix of a MIMO system and its application","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4669850/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4669850/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2008","accessionNumber":"10388605","dateOfInsertion":"11 November 2008","conferenceDate":"8-10 Aug. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Zero correlation matrix of a MIMO system and its application","confLoc":"Amman, Jordan","sourcePdf":"SPI-11062008-00022.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048726S","chronDate":"8-10 Aug. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4660002","isNumber":"4669828","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4660002","xplore-issue":"4669828","articleId":"4669850","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Mosharaka for Researches","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4669851,"authors":[{"name":"Hala Mahmoud","affiliation":["Department of Electronics Engineering, Al-Quds University, Jerusalem, Israel"],"firstName":"Hala","lastName":"Mahmoud","id":"37586168600"},{"name":"Allam Mousa","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, An-Najah-University, Nablus, Israel"],"firstName":"Allam","lastName":"Mousa","id":"37408038500"},{"name":"Rashid Saleem","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University of Manchester, Institute of Science and Technology, UK"],"firstName":"Rashid","lastName":"Saleem","id":"37391651300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-9927-486-02-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-9927-486-03-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4669851","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":385},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Channel estimation","Frequency estimation","Fading","Interpolation","Least squares approximation","Recursive estimation","Discrete Fourier transforms","OFDM modulation","Spline","Kalman filters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","fading channels","interpolation","Kalman filters","OFDM modulation","phase shift keying"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Kalman filter channel estimation","comb type pilots","OFDM system","time selective fading environments","frequency selective fading environments","BPSK modulation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Channel Estimation","OFDM","time-varying channels","Kalman Filtering"]}],"abstract":"Kalman-filter method have been used for the estimation of time-frequency-selective fading channels in OFDM systems, the estimation is based on Comb-type pilot frequencies arrangement, the channel coefficients that belong to the pilot subcarriers are estimated.

Yet one very exciting, revolutionary and life saving application in the form of Real time stress monitoring of Fighter Pilots through wearable wireless sensors in BAN has not been thought of. The statistics reveal that 40% of total flying accidents in Indian Air Force (IAF) occur due to pilot error, however, so far no scientific study has been undertaken to ascertain whether certain non-action/delayed actions taken by pilots in such accidents were related to stress induced.

It can be seen from the simulation results that the system developed improved the BER performance with high diversity order and successfully reduce ICI effect.","doi":"10.1109/MICCCA.2008.4669860","publicationTitle":"2008 Mosharaka International Conference on Communications, Computers and Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 Mosharaka International Conference on Communications, Computers and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4660002/4669828/04669860.pdf","startPage":"116","endPage":"121","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MICCCA.2008.4669860","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4669828","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Space Time Frequency Block Codes for MIMO-OFDM system using intercarrier interference self-cancellation schemes","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4669860","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 Aug. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4669860/","displayDocTitle":"Space Time Frequency Block Codes for MIMO-OFDM system using intercarrier interference self-cancellation schemes","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2008","accessionNumber":"10392316","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4669860/","conferenceDate":"8-10 Aug. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"11 November 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Space Time Frequency Block Codes for MIMO-OFDM system using intercarrier interference self-cancellation schemes","confLoc":"Amman, Jordan","sourcePdf":"SPI-11062008-00032.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.078488S","chronDate":"8-10 Aug. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4660002","isNumber":"4669828","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4660002","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4669828","articleId":"4669860","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Mosharaka for ResearchesIEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4669879,"authors":[{"name":"Shun-Hua Lin","affiliation":["Department of Communications Engineering,National Nano Device Laboratories, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Shun-Hua","lastName":"Lin","id":"37877048200"},{"name":"Jin-Tai Yan","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, Chung Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Jin-Tai","lastName":"Yan","id":"37281331900"},{"name":"Herming Chiueh","affiliation":["Department of Communications Engineering,National Nano Device Laboratories, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Herming","lastName":"Chiueh","id":"37370719700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3365-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-2-35500-008-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4669879","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":186},"abstract":"Thermal issues have become a determinant factor to result in very large scale integrated (VLSI) circuits work or malfunction. For this reason, the paper proposed an efficient block-level thermal model for temperature calculation in the floorplan stage among the integrated circuit (IC) design flow. Furthermore, the model accurately profiles the temperature difference between all thermal blocks and overcomes the very long computational time issue existing in traditional tile-based thermal model. We not only prove the timing complexity by theory but also use five floorplan benchmarks to test our model. Observing the experimental results, the temperature calculation times for all benchmarks are really direct ratio of total amount of blocks. Hence our block-level thermal model really can reduce the temperature calculating time and provide useful temperature differences for rearranging the floorplan.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 14th International Workshop on Thermal Inveatigation of ICs and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4663477/4669861/04669879.pdf","startPage":"58","endPage":"63","publicationTitle":"2008 14th International Workshop on Thermal Inveatigation of ICs and Systems","doi":"10.1109/THERMINIC.2008.4669879","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/THERMINIC.2008.4669879","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4669861","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4669879","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Block-level thermal model for floorplan stage in VLSI design flow","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Very large scale integration","Temperature","Integrated circuit modeling","Design engineering","Benchmark testing","Tiles","Equations","Thermal engineering","Thermal factors","Computer science"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["integrated circuit design","integrated circuit modelling","VLSI"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["block level thermal model","floorplan stage","VLSI","design flow","thermal issues","temperature calculation","temperature differences"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4669879/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-26 Sept. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Block-level thermal model for floorplan stage in VLSI design flow","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4669879/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2008","accessionNumber":"10390104","dateOfInsertion":"11 November 2008","conferenceDate":"24-26 Sept. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Block-level thermal model for floorplan stage in VLSI design flow","confLoc":"Rome, Italy","sourcePdf":"SPI-11062008-00018.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.07255S","chronDate":"24-26 Sept. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4663477","isNumber":"4669861","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4663477","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4669861","articleId":"4669879","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EDA PublishingIEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4669897,"authors":[{"name":"Abel Vamos","affiliation":["Department of Electron Devices, Budapest University\uc2a0of\uc2a0Technology\uc2a0and\uc2a0Economics, Budapest, Hungary"],"firstName":"Abel","lastName":"Vamos","id":"37877644700"},{"name":"Marta Rencz","affiliation":["Department of Electron Devices, Budapest University\uc2a0of\uc2a0Technology\uc2a0and\uc2a0Economics, Budapest, Hungary"],"firstName":"Marta","lastName":"Rencz","id":"37284514200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3365-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-2-35500-008-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4669897","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":113},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Field programmable gate arrays","Circuits","Energy consumption","Power dissipation","Cooling","Power system modeling","Silicon","Power supplies","Frequency estimation","Signal design"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","logic design"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FPGA power model","thermal dissipation minimization","IC","power-aware designing","integrated circuit","field programmable gate array"]}],"abstract":"In the field of application specific ICs the FPGA became more and more important.

This method employs smart functions of SPS devices such as over-current and over-temperature protection. The protective thermal shut down function is triggered by the temperature of the integrated temperature sensor. The temperature rise depends on power dissipation in the device and on the thermal junction to ambient impedance which is inter alia related to the die attach imperfection. The evaluation is performed on a two channel smart power switch. Results are focused on practical relevance and sensitivity of this method to the influence of die attach thickness and die attach voids.","doi":"10.1109/THERMINIC.2008.4669909","publicationTitle":"2008 14th International Workshop on Thermal Inveatigation of ICs and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 14th International Workshop on Thermal Inveatigation of ICs and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4663477/4669861/04669909.pdf","startPage":"204","endPage":"207","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/THERMINIC.2008.4669909","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4669861","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Evaluation of an electrical method for detection of die attach imperfections in Smart Power Switches using transient thermal FEM simulations","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4669909","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-26 Sept. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4669909/","displayDocTitle":"Evaluation of an electrical method for detection of die attach imperfections in Smart Power Switches using transient thermal FEM simulations","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2008","accessionNumber":"10393577","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4669909/","conferenceDate":"24-26 Sept. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"11 November 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Evaluation of an electrical method for detection of die attach imperfections in Smart Power Switches using transient thermal FEM simulations","confLoc":"Rome, Italy","sourcePdf":"SPI-11062008-00048.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072281S","chronDate":"24-26 Sept. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4663477","isNumber":"4669861","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4663477","xplore-issue":"4669861","articleId":"4669909","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EDA Publishing","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4669940,"authors":[{"name":"Jing Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of South Florida, Tampa, Florida, USA"],"firstName":"Jing","lastName":"Zhang","id":"38108300700"},{"name":"Rangachar Kasturi","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of South Florida, Tampa, Florida, USA"],"firstName":"Rangachar","lastName":"Kasturi","id":"37267344900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3337-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4669940","dbTime":"14 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":106,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":880},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Text analysis","Organizing","USA Councils","Image analysis","Character recognition","Handwriting recognition","Image recognition","Image resolution","Indexing","Document image processing"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Text extraction","Video documents","Recent progress"]}],"abstract":"Text extraction in video documents, as an important research field of content-based information indexing and retrieval, has been developing rapidly since 1990s.
