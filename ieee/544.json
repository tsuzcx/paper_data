The critical buckling phenomenon and bistability of the compliant buckling structures are considerably suitable for mechanically sensing the threshold acceleration, and eliminating the electrical power needed for retaining the stable state. Based on the bistability of the fully compliant clamped-clamped mechanism, a threshold accelerometer which can sense the threshold deceleration (cutoff acceleration) after being triggered is designed and fabricated in this paper. The accelerometer mainly consists of a contact, an inertial mass, and two parallel clamped-clamped beams with a length of <formula formulatype=\"inline\"> <tex Notation=\"TeX\">$L$</tex></formula> and an initial angle <formula formulatype=\"inline\"> <tex Notation=\"TeX\">$\\alpha$</tex></formula>. A mini rotating test bench is designed to test the sensing capability of threshold acceleration. The threshold acceleration and deceleration for triggering and cutting-off the accelerometer are 9.7 g and <formula formulatype=\"inline\"><tex Notation=\"TeX\">${-}3.1$</tex> </formula> g in experiments, which deviate from the design values of 10.0 g and <formula formulatype=\"inline\"><tex Notation=\"TeX\">${-}3.0$</tex></formula> g with only 3.0% and 3.33%, respectively. The capabilities of accurate threshold sensing and stable state retaining validate the feasibility of introducing the post-buckling compliant beams in designing threshold accelerometers. And, the accordance in the five experiment results also shows that the repeatability and structural simplicity of the designed threshold accelerometer ensure its reliability and applicability in engineering. </para>","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5437516","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSEN.2010.2042712","publicationTitle":"IEEE Sensors Journal","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Sensors Journal","pdfPath":"/iel5/7361/5437516/05440030.pdf","startPage":"1019","endPage":"1024","doi":"10.1109/JSEN.2010.2042712","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Bistable Threshold Accelerometer With Fully Compliant Clamped-Clamped Mechanism","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2010","displayDocTitle":"A Bistable Threshold Accelerometer With Fully Compliant Clamped-Clamped Mechanism","volume":"10","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/5440030/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May 2010","accessionNumber":"11206123","dateOfInsertion":"29 March 2010","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5440030/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 March 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Bistable Threshold Accelerometer With Fully Compliant Clamped-Clamped Mechanism","sourcePdf":"jsen-jzhao-2042712.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.085378S","chronDate":"May  2010","xplore-pub-id":"7361","isNumber":"5437516","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7361","citationCount":"32","xplore-issue":"5437516","articleId":"5440030","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":5440041,"authors":[{"name":"Juan A.

This paper presents a Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) approach to obtain the optimal rule set and the membership function. To develop the fuzzy system the membership functions and rule set are encoded as particles and evolved simultaneously using PSO. While designing the fuzzy classifier using PSO, the membership functions are represented as real numbers and the rule set is represented as discrete numbers. In the classification problem under consideration the objective is to maximize the correctly classified data and minimize the number of rules. This objective is formulated as fitness function to guide the search procedure to select an appropriate fuzzy classification system so that the number of fuzzy rules and the number of incorrectly classified patterns are simultaneously minimized. The performance of the proposed approach is demonstrated through development of fuzzy classifier for Iris data available in UCI machine learning repository and Simulation results show the suitability of the proposed approach for developing the fuzzy system.","doi":"10.1109/ICINNOVCT.2010.5440088","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Innovative Computing Technologies (ICICT)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5433811/5440078/05440088.pdf","publicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Innovative Computing Technologies (ICICT)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICINNOVCT.2010.5440088","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5440078","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design of optimal fuzzy classifier system using Particle Swarm Optimization","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fuzzy systems","Particle swarm optimization","Fuzzy sets","Fuzzy logic","Genetic algorithms","Fuzzy set theory","Iris","Machine learning","Humans","Algorithm design and analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fuzzy logic","fuzzy systems","particle swarm optimisation","pattern classification"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optimal fuzzy classifier system designing","particle swarm optimization","membership functions","optimal rule set","data classification","fitness functions","fuzzy classification system","patterns classification","Iris data","machine learning repository","simulation","fuzzy if-then rules"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Fuzzy Classifier","If-then rules","Membership function","Particle Swarm Optimization"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5440088/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-13 Feb. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Design of optimal fuzzy classifier system using Particle Swarm Optimization","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5440088/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"29 March 2010","conferenceDate":"12-13 Feb. 2010","accessionNumber":"11207690","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design of optimal fuzzy classifier system using Particle Swarm Optimization","confLoc":"Karur, India","sourcePdf":"PID12.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062756S","chronDate":"12-13 Feb. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5433811","isNumber":"5440078","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5433811","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5440078","articleId":"5440088","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":5440097,"authors":[{"name":"S.N.

The cognitive behavior helps the particle to remember its previous visited best position. This paper proposes to split the cognitive behavior into two sections .This modification helps the particle to search the target very effectively. In order to minimize the integral squared error of the lower order model MPSO is proposed and results are shown in the form of unit step response curves and are compared with the response of the original higher order model and with the other model formulation methods. The proposed method is illustrated through numerical example from literature.","doi":"10.1109/ICINNOVCT.2010.5440097","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","publicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Innovative Computing Technologies (ICICT)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICINNOVCT.2010.5440097","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5440078","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Innovative Computing Technologies (ICICT)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5433811/5440078/05440097.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A modified particle swarm optimization for lower order model formulation of linear time invariant continuous systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5440097/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A modified particle swarm optimization for lower order model formulation of linear time invariant continuous systems","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5440097/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11207699","publicationDate":"Feb. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"29 March 2010","conferenceDate":"12-13 Feb. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-13 Feb. 2010","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A modified particle swarm optimization for lower order model formulation of linear time invariant continuous systems","confLoc":"Karur, India","sourcePdf":"PID01.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060291S","chronDate":"12-13 Feb. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5433811","isNumber":"5440078","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5433811","xplore-issue":"5440078","articleId":"5440097","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5440127,"authors":[{"name":"Mamdouh Gouda","affiliation":["Electronic & Communication Engineering, Misr university for Science & Technology, Cairo, Egypt"],"firstName":"Mamdouh","lastName":"Gouda","id":"37345930700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5428-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5427-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-89-5519-146-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1738-9445"},{"format":"CD","value":"1738-9445"}],"articleNumber":"5440127","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":179},"abstract":"Conventional intercept receivers based on second order signal processing are generally ineffective in detecting direct sequence spread spectrum signals if the spreading sequences are unavailable. Also the capacity of direct sequence code division multiple access is limited by multiple access interference. Previous work has shown that the triple correlation function is used to implement triple correlation receiver to detect direct sequence spread spectrum signals. In this receiver, the received signal is auto-triple-correlated at a particular lag such that the transmitted code acts as its own reference. In this paper, we study the conventional direct sequence CDMA system, the cross-correlation between codes of length 127. The study has been extended to calculate the triple correlation function for the same code. A proposed triple correlation receiver to detect the pervious codes is presented. Finally, a detailed study of triple correlation receiver in multiuser environment for direct sequence CDMA has been performed. The study ended with a comparison between conventional and triple correlation receivers with numerical examples illustrated.","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 The 12th International Conference on Advanced Communication Technology (ICACT)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5433809/5440112/05440127.pdf","startPage":"909","endPage":"914","publicationTitle":"2010 The 12th International Conference on Advanced Communication Technology (ICACT)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5440112","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5440127","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Proposed triple correlation receiver for CDMA","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multiaccess communication","Detectors","Matched filters","Signal processing","Spread spectrum communication","Direct-sequence code-division multiple access","Multiple access interference","Code division multiplexing","Mobile computing","AWGN channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiple access","multiuser detection","radio receivers","spread spectrum communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["direct sequence code division multiple access","triple correlation receiver","intercept receivers","second order signal processing","direct sequence spread spectrum signal detection","multiuser environment"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5440127/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-10 Feb. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Proposed triple correlation receiver for CDMA","isConference":true,"volume":"1","htmlLink":"/document/5440127/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2010","accessionNumber":"11208789","dateOfInsertion":"01 April 2010","conferenceDate":"7-10 Feb. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Proposed triple correlation receiver for CDMA","confLoc":"Gangwon, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"06E15.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061446S","chronDate":"7-10 Feb. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5433809","isNumber":"5440112","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5433809","xplore-issue":"5440112","articleId":"5440127","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5440129,"authors":[{"name":"Jonathan Koomey","affiliation":["Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/85/5986492/5440129/5440129-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jonathan Koomey is a consulting professor at Stanford University.

The main principle of these radio networks is opportunistic access to the spectrum holes mainly licensed to primary users (PUs). Within power systems, on the other hand, smart grid is one of the main areas of research. The core aspect of these grids is making use of digital technologies to save energy, reduce cost and increase reliability and transparency in order to optimize the utilization of the available resources. Since scarcity of resources is the crisis of both communication systems and electrical energy systems, in this paper, comparing the smart grids with communication systems in general and with CRs especially, solutions for the problem of spectrum scarcity will be explored.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"7-10 Feb. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5440130/","isConference":true,"volume":"1","accessionNumber":"11208812","publicationDate":"Feb. 2010","conferenceDate":"7-10 Feb. 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5440130/","dateOfInsertion":"01 April 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Comparison of smart grid with cognitive radio: Solutions to spectrum scarcity","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Comparison of smart grid with cognitive radio: Solutions to spectrum scarcity","confLoc":"Gangwon, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"06E13.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070912S","chronDate":"7-10 Feb. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5433809","isNumber":"5440112","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5433809","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5440112","articleId":"5440130","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5440131,"authors":[{"name":"Jin-Seok Kim","affiliation":["School of Information and Communication Engineering, Sungkyunkwan University, Suwon, South Korea"],"lastName":"Jin-Seok Kim","id":"37088299798"},{"name":"Tae-Jin Lee","affiliation":["School of Information and Communication Engineering, Sungkyunkwan University, Suwon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Tae-Jin","lastName":"Lee","id":"37277273500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5428-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5427-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-89-5519-146-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1738-9445"},{"format":"CD","value":"1738-9445"}],"articleNumber":"5440131","dbTime":"21 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":11,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":834},"abstract":"Femtocells enable in-home cell phone coverage and provide access to high speed wireless broadband services. The Femtocell network architecture is very different from the existing based on the UMTS macrocell network architecture. Hence, a modified handover procedure for existing networks is needed to support macrocell/femtocell integrated networks. Voice call services are an essential part of mobile communications and studies of mobile usage show that more than 50 percent of all voice calls are placed indoors. Frequent and unnecessary handovers are another problem of heterogeneous network environments. In this paper, we propose a modified handover procedure for voice call service between 3GPP UMTS-based macrocell and femtocell networks. And Call Admission Control (CAC) to reduce the unnecessary handover in the hybrid access mode is proposed.","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 The 12th International Conference on Advanced Communication Technology (ICACT)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5433809/5440112/05440131.pdf","startPage":"904","endPage":"908","publicationTitle":"2010 The 12th International Conference on Advanced Communication Technology (ICACT)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5440112","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5440131","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Handover in UMTS networks with hybrid access femtocells","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["3G mobile communication","Macrocell networks","Femtocell networks","Base stations","Bandwidth","Call admission control","Land mobile radio cellular systems","Interference","Cellular phones","Mobile communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["3G mobile communication","telecommunication congestion control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["UMTS macrocell network architecture","hybrid access femtocell","high speed wireless broadband service","macrocell-femtocell integrated network","voice call service","mobile communication","handover procedure","3GPP UMTS-based macrocell","call admission control"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["handover","hybrid access","3GPP","Macrocell","Femtocell","UMTS"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5440131/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-10 Feb. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Handover in UMTS networks with hybrid access femtocells","isConference":true,"volume":"1","htmlLink":"/document/5440131/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2010","accessionNumber":"11208747","dateOfInsertion":"01 April 2010","conferenceDate":"7-10 Feb. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Handover in UMTS networks with hybrid access femtocells","confLoc":"Gangwon, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"06E14.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057725S","chronDate":"7-10 Feb. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5433809","isNumber":"5440112","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5433809","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"5440112","articleId":"5440131","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5440133,"authors":[{"name":"Takahiro Matsumoto","affiliation":["Graduate School of Science and Engineering, Yamaguchi University, Ube, Yamaguchi, Japan"],"firstName":"Takahiro","lastName":"Matsumoto","id":"37403170600"},{"name":"Yu Suwaki","affiliation":["Graduate School of Science and Engineering, Yamaguchi University, Ube, Yamaguchi, Japan"],"firstName":"Yu","lastName":"Suwaki","id":"37391698200"},{"name":"Shinya Matsufuji","affiliation":["Graduate School of Science and Engineering, Yamaguchi University, Ube, Yamaguchi, Japan"],"firstName":"Shinya","lastName":"Matsufuji","id":"37354063000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5428-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5427-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-89-5519-146-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1738-9445"},{"format":"CD","value":"1738-9445"}],"articleNumber":"5440133","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":181},"abstract":"The optical ZCZ code, which is a set of pairs of binary and bi-phase sequences with zero correlation zone, can provide optical code division multiple access (CDMA) communication system without co-channel interference.

Though FMC based services are provided by several TelCo's, all of them are based on specialized methods, not on standards. KT in Korea has already deployed 3W (WiBro, WiFi, and WCDMA) based FMC networks. KT now is seeking the methods how to maximize integration effects between KT and KTF. First of all, 3W based service deployment and FMC solutions how to integrate and mix up heterogeneous access networks are essential. In this paper, we propose the FMC deployment strategies considering 3W based transport networks.

In general, for the space-time coded systems, there are two filters to be designed, where one is for detecting odd-indexed symbols and the other for even-indexed symbols. In the proposed scheme, the two filters are independently updated and convergence properties such as convergence condition, time constant, and steady-state excess mean-squared error (MSE) are analyzed.

First, the scenario in which a single cognitive user wishes to opportunistically exploit the availability of frequency bands is considered. By adopting tools from the classical bandit problem, optimal as well as low complexity asymptotically optimal solutions are developed. Next, the multiple cognitive user scenario is considered. The situation in which the availability probability of each channel is known is first considered. An optimal symmetric strategy that maximizes the total throughput of the cognitive users is developed. To avoid the possible selfish behavior of the cognitive users, a game-theoretic model is then developed. The performance of both models is characterized analytically. Then, the situation in which the availability probability of each channel is unknown a priori is considered. Low-complexity medium access protocols, which strike an optimal balance between exploration and exploitation in such competitive environments, are developed. The operating points of these low-complexity protocols are shown to converge to those of the scenario in which the availability probabilities are known. Finally, numerical results are provided to illustrate the impact of sensing errors and other practical considerations.","doi":"10.1109/TMC.2010.65","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/7755/5671529/05440181.pdf","startPage":"239","endPage":"253","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMC.2010.65","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5671529","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cognitive Medium Access: Exploration, Exploitation, and Competition","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5440181","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 March 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5440181/","displayDocTitle":"Cognitive Medium Access: Exploration, Exploitation, and Competition","volume":"10","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Feb. 2011","accessionNumber":"11698246","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5440181/","dateOfInsertion":"17 December 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cognitive Medium Access: Exploration, Exploitation, and Competition","sourcePdf":"ttm2011020239.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.11776S","chronDate":"Feb.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"7755","isNumber":"5671529","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7755","citationCount":"201","xplore-issue":"5671529","articleId":"5440181","onlineDate":"29 March 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5440184,"authors":[{"name":"Szu-Lin Su","affiliation":["Institute of Computer and Communication Engineering, Department of Electrical Engineering, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Szu-Lin Su","id":"37280943400"},{"name":"Yung-Chuan Lin","affiliation":["SoC Technology Center, Industrial Technology and Research Institute, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Yung-Chuan Lin","id":"37405324900"},{"name":"Chieh-Chih Hsu","affiliation":["Institute of Computer and Communication Engineering, Department of Electrical Engineering, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Chieh-Chih Hsu","id":"37402567400"},{"name":"Gene C.H.

In order to achieve robust performance, one of the most important steps is the channel estimation procedure based on limited number of pilot signals. Owing to the channel's time variant characteristic caused by user's mobility and irregular arrangement of pilot signals in 802.16e system, the exact channel estimation is more difficult to achieve for this system.

However, by using frequency diversity in multicarrier DS-CDMA system, the effect of ICI caused by CFO can be significantly reduced. This can be achieved in Time-Frequency (TF) domain spreading MC DS-CDMA system which employs both time and frequency (TF) domain spreading or hybrid spreading. In this paper, the performance of TF-domain spread MC-DS-CDMA system over Nakagami-m fading channels is evaluated and investigated with varying CFO, number of users, number of subcarriers, and Signal-To-Noise-Ratio (SNR). The probability of bit error rate (BER) of TF-domain spread MC-DS-CDMA is derived using the standard Gaussian Approximation (SGA) approach for different values of m parameter. Numerical evaluation of the analytical expression of BER reveals that a high capacity and BER performance improvement are achieved for TF-domain spread MC-DS-CDMA system over the performance of multicarrier CDMA (MC-CDMA) system which spreads the signal in the frequency domain only. The simulation results show excellent agreement with the analysis.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5440112","publicationTitle":"2010 The 12th International Conference on Advanced Communication Technology (ICACT)","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 The 12th International Conference on Advanced Communication Technology (ICACT)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5433809/5440112/05440193.pdf","startPage":"743","endPage":"749","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance of multicarrier CDMA with dual spreading in Nakagami-m frequency offset fading channels","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-10 Feb. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Performance of multicarrier CDMA with dual spreading in Nakagami-m frequency offset fading channels","isConference":true,"volume":"1","conferenceDate":"7-10 Feb. 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5440193/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2010","accessionNumber":"11226608","dateOfInsertion":"01 April 2010","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5440193/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance of multicarrier CDMA with dual spreading in Nakagami-m frequency offset fading channels","confLoc":"Gangwon, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"06A04.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.080642S","chronDate":"7-10 Feb. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5433809","isNumber":"5440112","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5433809","xplore-issue":"5440112","articleId":"5440193","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":5440201,"authors":[{"name":"Farid Samsami Khodadad","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Sharif University, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Farid Samsami","lastName":"Khodadad","id":"37391690200"},{"name":"Fatemeh Ganji","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Sharif University, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Fatemeh","lastName":"Ganji","id":"37391691200"},{"name":"Amin Safaei","affiliation":["International Campus of Sharif University of Technology"],"firstName":"Amin","lastName":"Safaei","id":"37391690400"},{"name":"Farshid Samsami Khodadad","affiliation":["International Campus of Sharif University of Technology"],"firstName":"Farshid Samsami","lastName":"Khodadad","id":"38481577700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5428-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5427-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-89-5519-146-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1738-9445"},{"format":"CD","value":"1738-9445"}],"articleNumber":"5440201","dbTime":"15 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":167},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multiaccess communication","Multipath channels","Signal to noise ratio","Noise robustness","Spread spectrum communication","Downlink","Statistics","Fading","Smoothing methods","Computational modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiple access","fading channels","multipath channels","signal detection","spread spectrum communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["pseudo noise length estimation","down link low- SNR DS-CDMA multipath channels","blind detection","multiuser spread spectrum signal","second order statistic estimator","fading multipath phenomenon","blind estimation","searching method","adaptive algorithmic thresholds"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["DS-CDMA","PN code","Blind Detection","Autocorrelation Matrix","Second Order Statistic estimator"]}],"abstract":"In this paper an efficient method is proposed for blind detection of multiuser spread spectrum signal and pseudo noise (PN) length estimation in downlink scenario.

In low SNR, the fading multipath phenomenon especially in length of small codes leads to problem in detecting place of correlation estimator peaks. In this paper besides expanding blind estimation to multiuser environment, by using searching method in updating the length of correlation window coordinated with length of spreading code and also choosing proper adaptive algorithmic thresholds for smoothing this difficulty is presented.

LTE uses orthogonal frequency division multiplexing access (OFDMA) scheme for the downlink transmission and single carrier frequency division multiple access (SCFDMA) in uplink. Main challenges for a terminal implementation are efficient realization of the inner receiver, especially for channel estimation (CE) and equalization. In this paper, a new channel estimator is presented for an OFDMA system under the umbrella of the 3GPP LTE that can avoid the ill-conditioned least square (LS) problem. This channel estimation method uses knowledge of channel properties to estimate the unknown channel transfer function at non-pilot sub-carriers. Therefore, the computational complexity can be reduced significantly.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5440109","startPage":"1198","endPage":"1202","pdfPath":"/iel5/5433809/5440109/05440251.pdf","publicationTitle":"2010 The 12th International Conference on Advanced Communication Technology (ICACT)","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 The 12th International Conference on Advanced Communication Technology (ICACT)","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Low complexity downlink channel estimation for LTE systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Downlink","Channel estimation","Long Term Evolution","Delay","OFDM","Frequency conversion","Computational complexity","Peak to average power ratio","Wireless communication","Throughput"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["3G mobile communication","channel estimation","frequency division multiple access","least squares approximations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","LTE systems","3rd generation partnership project long term evolution","spectral efficiency","voice support","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing access scheme","OFDMA scheme","single carrier frequency division multiple access","channel equalization","least square problem","channel transfer function","computational complexity"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["3GPP LTE","OFDMA","channel estimation","least-square","equalizer","PAPR","SCFDMA"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"7-10 Feb. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Low complexity downlink channel estimation for LTE systems","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5440251/","dateOfInsertion":"01 April 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"isConference":true,"volume":"2","htmlLink":"/document/5440251/","accessionNumber":"11226663","publicationDate":"Feb. 2010","conferenceDate":"7-10 Feb. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low complexity downlink channel estimation for LTE systems","confLoc":"Gangwon, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"08E05.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069275S","chronDate":"7-10 Feb. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5433809","isNumber":"5440109","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5433809","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5440109","articleId":"5440251","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":5440270,"authors":[{"name":"Fatemeh Ganji","affiliation":["Malek Ashtar University of Technology, Iran"],"firstName":"Fatemeh","lastName":"Ganji","id":"37391691200"},{"name":"Vahid Tabatabavakili","affiliation":["Iran Science and Technology University, Iran"],"firstName":"Vahid","lastName":"Tabatabavakili","id":"37391690000"},{"name":"Farid Samsami Khodadad","affiliation":["Malek Ashtar University of Technology, Iran"],"lastName":"Farid Samsami Khodadad","id":"37391690200"},{"name":"Makan Hosseinnezhad","affiliation":["Islamic Azad University\uc2a0, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Makan","lastName":"Hosseinnezhad","id":"37391690300"},{"name":"Amin Safaei","affiliation":["Sharif University of Technology, Iran"],"firstName":"Amin","lastName":"Safaei","id":"37391690400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5428-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5427-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-89-5519-146-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1738-9445"},{"format":"CD","value":"1738-9445"}],"articleNumber":"5440270","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":226},"abstract":"IN this paper the effect of different channel estimation approaches in OFDMA uplink system which are based on Basis Expansion Model (BEM) and widely used to consider time varying channels are discussed. It has been shown in previous works that modeling error will be reduced by applying oversampled BEM with cost of increasing sensitivity to noise. This problem will be solved by combining oversampled BEM and MMSE channel estimator with cost of increasing computational complexity. In this paper a novel channel estimation approach is represented in which by combining oversampled BEM and low rank MMSE in frequency domain, almost the same performance as the full rank MMSE has been achieved while computational complexity reduces significantly.","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 The 12th International Conference on Advanced Communication Technology (ICACT)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5433809/5440109/05440270.pdf","startPage":"1289","endPage":"1293","publicationTitle":"2010 The 12th International Conference on Advanced Communication Technology (ICACT)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5440109","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5440270","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A novel BEM- based channel estimation algorithm for time variant uplink OFDMA system","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Channel estimation","Frequency estimation","Fading","Frequency domain analysis","OFDM","Computational complexity","Frequency conversion","Interference","Random processes","Scattering"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","frequency division multiple access","least mean squares methods","time-varying channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","orthogonal frequency division multiple access","time variant uplink OFDMA system","basis expansion model","minimum mean square error methods","computational complexity"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Channel estimation","Basis Expansion Model (BEM)","MMSE","OFDMA","Time varying channel"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5440270/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-10 Feb. 2010","displayDocTitle":"A novel BEM- based channel estimation algorithm for time variant uplink OFDMA system","isConference":true,"volume":"2","htmlLink":"/document/5440270/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2010","accessionNumber":"11226631","dateOfInsertion":"01 April 2010","conferenceDate":"7-10 Feb. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A novel BEM- based channel estimation algorithm for time variant uplink OFDMA system","confLoc":"Gangwon, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"09A03.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067622S","chronDate":"7-10 Feb. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5433809","isNumber":"5440109","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5433809","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5440109","articleId":"5440270","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5440272,"authors":[{"name":"Ahmed Bannour","affiliation":["Tel Laboratory, National Engineering School of Sousse, SUPCOM, Tunis, Tunisia"],"firstName":"Ahmed","lastName":"Bannour","id":"37391798100"},{"name":"Mohamed Lassaad Ammari","affiliation":["Tel Laboratory, National Engineering School of Sousse, SUPCOM, Sousse, Tunisia"],"firstName":"Mohamed Lassaad","lastName":"Ammari","id":"37269366100"},{"name":"Ridha Bouallegue","affiliation":["Tel Laboratory, National Engineering School of Sousse, SUPCOM, Tunis, Tunisia"],"firstName":"Ridha","lastName":"Bouallegue","id":"37297081100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5428-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5427-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-89-5519-146-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1738-9445"},{"format":"CD","value":"1738-9445"}],"articleNumber":"5440272","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":63},"abstract":"In this paper, we analyze the performance of an Algebraic Space Time Codes (ASTC), called the Golden code.

To get the appropriate services from the sensor nodes of u-city we have to consider the delay, energy consumption and network size of each Wireless Sensor Network (WSN). Zigbee provides a possible solution to reduce the number of hops by dividing the whole sensor network into several clusters, but the latency is a prime limitation. We propose a Synchronized Latency Secured (Sync-LS) MAC protocol as a new protocol which will solve the latency problem by reducing the number of time frames requirement in the cluster while the energy consumption is nearly same as Zigbee. In addition to the Sync-LS MAC we are going to propose a Passive Optical Network (PON) based architecture to connect all the cluster heads with the Personal Area Network Coordinator (PANC). Here, the PANC acts as an Optical Line Terminal (OLT) and each cluster head acts as an individual Optical Network Unit (ONU). PON based architecture is a best solution of high bandwidth requirements with inexpensive and integrated broadband services to the users in a very efficient way. PON has sufficient bandwidth but to efficiently utilizing it a proper Dynamic Bandwidth Allocation (DBA) algorithm is required for bandwidth allocation among the ONUs. We have proposed a framework that classify the ONUs on the basis of service priority and allocate the bandwidth according to that priority. This framework is a combination of new Sync-LS MAC protocol for cluster based WSN with PON.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Synchronized Latency Secured MAC protocol for PON based large sensor network","publicationTitle":"2010 The 12th International Conference on Advanced Communication Technology (ICACT)","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 The 12th International Conference on Advanced Communication Technology (ICACT)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5433809/5440109/05440320.pdf","startPage":"1528","endPage":"1532","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5440109","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5440320","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5440320/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-10 Feb. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Synchronized Latency Secured MAC protocol for PON based large sensor network","conferenceDate":"7-10 Feb. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"2","htmlLink":"/document/5440320/","dateOfInsertion":"01 April 2010","publicationDate":"Feb. 2010","accessionNumber":"11208853","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Synchronized Latency Secured MAC protocol for PON based large sensor network","confLoc":"Gangwon, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"11A04.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060201S","chronDate":"7-10 Feb. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5433809","isNumber":"5440109","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5433809","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5440109","articleId":"5440320","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5440338,"authors":[{"name":"Jing Chen","affiliation":["School of Software and Microelectronics, Peking University, China"],"lastName":"Jing Chen","id":"37406652100"},{"name":"Yongliang Chen","affiliation":["School of Software and Microelectronics, Peking University, China"],"lastName":"Yongliang Chen","id":"37407080200"},{"name":"Hantao Zhu","affiliation":["School of Software and Microelectronics, Peking University, China"],"lastName":"Hantao Zhu","id":"37401248000"},{"name":"Chunchun Sui","affiliation":["School of Software and Microelectronics, Peking University, China"],"lastName":"Chunchun Sui","id":"37393684700"},{"name":"PuFeng Wu","affiliation":["The School of Management, Xi''an Jiaotong University, China"],"lastName":"PuFeng Wu","id":"37398631200"},{"name":"Xixin Cao","affiliation":["School of Software and Microelectronics, Peking University, China"],"lastName":"Xixin Cao","id":"37069194300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5428-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5427-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-89-5519-146-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1738-9445"},{"format":"CD","value":"1738-9445"}],"articleNumber":"5440338","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":267},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hardware","Automatic voltage control","Entropy coding","Video coding","Codecs","Streaming media","Tail","Microelectronics","Pipeline processing","Clocks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive codes","block codes","code standards","data compression","variable length codes","video coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hardware design","CAVLC","H.264-AVC","context-based adaptive variable-length coding","video coding standard","source data coding","quantized transformed coefficients","frequency 31.2 MHz","frequency 156.6 MHz"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Context-based adaptive variable length coding","Exp-Golomb","H.264"]}],"abstract":"Context-based adaptive variable-length coding (CAVLC) is a new and important feature of the latest video coding standard H.264/AVC.

The design objective is to determine, in each frame, which secondary user (SU) transmits data when primary user (PU) is idle. We propose a sensing and access scheme which is adopted in a fully distributed manner. First we assume that there is no sensing error and compare the average throughput of the proposed scheme with that of optimum. The performance of the proposed scheme if there is no sensing error has a feature similar to optimal case. And the performance is improved in a large network with much more secondary users. Next we analyze the performance of the proposed scheme if there is sensing error. Under imperfect sensing, the average throughput of the proposed scheme shows a different feature. The numerical examples show that there exists the optimal number of SUs and sensing duration to maximize the average throughput for a given target detection probability.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5440403/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-10 Feb. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"1","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"01 April 2010","accessionNumber":"11226578","htmlLink":"/document/5440403/","conferenceDate":"7-10 Feb. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Distributed spectrum sensing and access with secondary channel quality in cognitive radio networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distributed spectrum sensing and access with secondary channel quality in cognitive radio networks","confLoc":"Gangwon, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"04E02.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069843S","chronDate":"7-10 Feb. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5433809","isNumber":"5440112","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5433809","xplore-issue":"5440112","articleId":"5440403","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5440450,"authors":[{"name":"Yan-Ru Peng","affiliation":["Institute for Information Industry, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Yan-Ru","lastName":"Peng","id":"37405087000"},{"name":"Wei-Lun Lin","affiliation":["The Graduate Institute of Communication Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Wei-Lun","lastName":"Lin","id":"37403859300"},{"name":"Char-Dir Chung","affiliation":["The Graduate Institute of Communication Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Char-Dir","lastName":"Chung","id":"37334648000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5428-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5427-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-89-5519-146-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1738-9445"},{"format":"CD","value":"1738-9445"}],"articleNumber":"5440450","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":103},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fading","OFDM modulation","AWGN","Power system modeling","Degradation","Frequency modulation","Throughput","Bit error rate","Discrete Fourier transforms","Zinc"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive modulation","fading channels","OFDM modulation","precoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive spectrally-precoded OFDM","flat fading channel","adaptive transmission technique","orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Adaptive modulation","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","spectral precoding","average spectral efficiency"]}],"abstract":"Adaptive transmission technique adopting spectrally-precoded orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (SP-OFDM) signals is studied on the flat fading channel.

Besides these benefits, one of the main disadvantages is the PAPR problem. High PAPR will increase the system complexity and restrict the system performance. Within the existing PAPR reduction methods, SLM (Selected Mapping) is one of the most popular. The PAPR performance of SLM-OFDM is improved by efficient phase rotation factors, which will increase the size of side information and reduce the information data rate. In this paper, we propose a method for SLM to choose the most efficient phase rotation factors, so that SLM-OFDM can get efficient PAPR performances with limited size of side information. Through simple analysis, we compare the PAPR performances of different phase rotation factors and make a conclusion of the regulation.","publicationTitle":"2010 The 12th International Conference on Advanced Communication Technology (ICACT)","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 The 12th International Conference on Advanced Communication Technology (ICACT)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5433809/5440112/05440452.pdf","startPage":"324","endPage":"328","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5440112","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"PAPR reduction of OFDM signal using an efficient SLM technique","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5440452","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-10 Feb. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5440452/","displayDocTitle":"PAPR reduction of OFDM signal using an efficient SLM technique","volume":"1","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2010","accessionNumber":"11208775","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5440452/","conferenceDate":"7-10 Feb. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"01 April 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"PAPR reduction of OFDM signal using an efficient SLM technique","confLoc":"Gangwon, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"03A03.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045408S","chronDate":"7-10 Feb. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5433809","isNumber":"5440112","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5433809","xplore-issue":"5440112","articleId":"5440452","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5440454,"authors":[{"name":"Hyung-Sin Kim","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and INMC, Seoul National University of Technology, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Hyung-Sin","lastName":"Kim","id":"37406288500"},{"name":"Seung-Hwan Lee","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and INMC, Seoul National University of Technology, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Seung-Hwan","lastName":"Lee","id":"37407219300"},{"name":"Yong-Hwan Lee","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and INMC, Seoul National University of Technology, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Yong-Hwan","lastName":"Lee","id":"37281125100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5428-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5427-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-89-5519-146-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1738-9445"},{"format":"CD","value":"1738-9445"}],"articleNumber":"5440454","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":137},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wireless cellular systems","Interference","Frequency estimation","Array signal processing","Resource management","Frequency domain analysis","Computer simulation","Open systems","Multiuser detection","Frequency division multiplexing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","cellular radio","least mean squares methods","OFDM modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel sounding","OFDM-based wireless cellular systems","multi-sector cooperative beamforming","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","signaling overhead","physical resource unit","PRU","channel correlation","minimum-mean-square-error estimation","computer simulation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["cooperative beamforming","multi-user diversity","sounding overhead","frequency correlation","minimum-mean square-error estimation"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we consider channel sounding for multi-sector cooperative beamforming in orthogonal frequency division multiplexing-based wireless cellular systems. The use of conventional sounding schemes may suffer from interference from other sectors and also require large signaling overhead. To reduce the sounding interference near the sector boundary as well as the signaling overhead, we allocate the sounding physical resource unit (PRU) by exploiting the channel correlation in the frequency domain. The proposed scheme transmits the sounding signal through the PRUs which are less correlated to each other, significantly reducing the signaling overhead. The whole channel information can be extracted from the sounding PRUs by means of minimum-mean-square-error estimation. Finally, the performance of the proposed sounding scheme is verified by computer simulation, showing remarkable performance improvement over conventional schemes in the presence of channel correlation, while significantly reducing the signaling overhead.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Channel sounding for multi-sector cooperation in OFDM-based wireless cellular systems","publicationTitle":"2010 The 12th International Conference on Advanced Communication Technology (ICACT)","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 The 12th International Conference on Advanced Communication Technology (ICACT)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5433809/5440112/05440454.pdf","startPage":"313","endPage":"317","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5440112","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5440454","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5440454/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-10 Feb. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Channel sounding for multi-sector cooperation in OFDM-based wireless cellular systems","conferenceDate":"7-10 Feb. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"1","htmlLink":"/document/5440454/","dateOfInsertion":"01 April 2010","publicationDate":"Feb. 2010","accessionNumber":"11208818","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Channel sounding for multi-sector cooperation in OFDM-based wireless cellular systems","confLoc":"Gangwon, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"03A01.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072243S","chronDate":"7-10 Feb. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5433809","isNumber":"5440112","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5433809","xplore-issue":"5440112","articleId":"5440454","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5440489,"authors":[{"name":"R.

The proposed scalable FFT processor can support the variable lengths of 64, 128, 512, 1024 and 2048. By reducing the required number of non-trivial multipliers with mixed-radix (MR) and multi-path delay commutator (MDC) architecture, the complexity of the proposed FFT processor is dramatically decreased without sacrificing system throughput. The proposed FFT processor was designed in hardware description language (HDL) and implemented with Xilinx Virtex-4 FPGA. With the proposed architecture, the number of slices for the processor is 1784, the number of DSP48s (dedicated multiplier) is 48, and the size of memory is 90Kbits, which are reduced by 41.9%, 62.5% and 39%, respectively, compared with those of the 4-channel radix-2 single-path delay feedback (R2SDF) FFT processor.

In this paper we propose low complexity physical layer identity detection as one of cell search step using finite impulse response (FIR) and partial cross-correlation. Our propose scheme is done in time domain instead of frequency to avoid FFT involvement and decrease processing latency.

The position of the source of the radioactivity can be plotted and displayed to produce a two dimensional image for medical diagnostic. In this work a hardware architecture for reconstruction of 2D images based in FPGAs (Field Programmable Gate Arrays) in a gamma camera for small animals is presented. The hardware implementation takes the digitized voltage signals produced by the data acquisition electronics of the photomultiplier tubes and process them to allow identifying events and to determine the strength and positions of the interactions based on the logic of Anger to form a planar image. The architecture performs arithmetic operations, formats the data and stores them in memory blocks to be sent to the displaying stage. Through the use of parallelism techniques and an appropriate management of memory, the necessary logic to structure images is implemented inside the FPGA, reducing the time of processing to reach real time performance and to improve flexibility. The system has been implemented using a FPGA Virtex IV of the Xilinx's family obtaining an area occupation of around 22%, achieving an operation frequency of 322 MHz. These results show the potential of the hardware architecture implemented for its application in images reconstruction on line.","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 20th International Conference on

This booming technology of dynamic spectrum allocation, popularly known as cognitive radio has setup new horizons in the field, to explore and to work on. Cognitive radio is envisioned as the ultimate system that can sense, adapt and learn from the environment in which it operates. Sensing the higher bandwidth an SDR (Software defined radio) in a Cognitive System, tunes the circuits in the System for transferring data at higher data rates. At such increased data rates the BER (Bit Error Rate) performance may degrade. So it is a must for the SDR to accordingly add processing circuits to maintain the BER. One such option has been explored and worked on. It is by using the FHSS (Frequency Hopping Spread Spectrum technique) that one can maintain the BER performance at increased data rates. Earlier work includes the use of higher bandwidth available for increasing the coding bits and thereby making the data more secure. In other words availability of higher bandwidth in Cognitive radio can be utilized either to increase the actual data rate (Yet maintain the BER) or to improve the BER performance & maintain the original data rate. Results of FHSS implementation by Matlab M-file programming and improved BER performance by adaptive coder both have been depicted in the paper. In fact present paper is an outcome of the doctoral research on Error Control Coding for performance improvement in BER.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 Feb. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5440795/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"11226706","publicationDate":"Feb. 2010","conferenceDate":"22-24 Feb. 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5440795/","dateOfInsertion":"01 April 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"BER performance maintenance at high data rates in cognitive radio","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"BER performance maintenance at high data rates in cognitive radio","confLoc":"Cholula, Puebla, Mexico","sourcePdf":"14paper.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059662S","chronDate":"22-24 Feb. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5433810","isNumber":"5440746","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5433810","xplore-issue":"5440746","articleId":"5440795","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5440796,"authors":[{"name":"Mohamed A.

Based on the Kalman filter channel estimator, soft-input-soft-output (SISO) minimum mean square error (MMSE) equalizer and a maximum posterior probability (MAP) decoder, the channel estimate can be improved for each iteration by using soft information feedback from the decoder. Computer simulations show good estimation and tracking by the Kalman filter with only a few training (pilot) symbols even when signals experience deep fading. It is observed from simulations that the overall system performance can be improved by 4 dB after 14 iterations compared to non-iterative channel estimation and equalization. The proposed method is shown to obtain fast channel estimation and low complexity turbo equalization which are requirements in time-varying fading channels.","doi":"10.1109/CONIELECOMP.2010.5440796","publicationTitle":"2010 20th International Conference on Electronics Communications and Computers (CONIELECOMP)","startPage":"48","endPage":"52","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CONIELECOMP.2010.5440796","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5440746","pdfPath":"/iel5/5433810/5440746/05440796.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 20th International Conference on Electronics Communications and Computers (CONIELECOMP)","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Channel estimation","Time varying systems","Fading","OFDM","Iterative decoding","Concatenated codes","Block codes","Mean square error methods","Equalizers","Feedback"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["block codes","channel estimation","equalisers","iterative decoding","Kalman filters","maximum likelihood decoding","mean square error methods","multipath channels","OFDM modulation","Rayleigh channels","space-time codes","turbo codes","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["turbo channel equalization","STBC-OFDM system","time-varying wireless channel","iterative turbo channel estimation","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","space-time block code","time-varying multipath Rayleigh fading channel","Kalman filter","soft-input-soft-output minimum mean square error equalizer","MMSE equalizer","maximum posterior probability decoder","MAP decoder","soft information feedback"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Channel estimation","STBC","OFDM"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Turbo channel estimation and equalization of STBC-OFDM system over time-varying wireless channels","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5440796/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5440796/","accessionNumber":"11208943","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"01 April 2010","publicationDate":"Feb. 2010","conferenceDate":"22-24 Feb. 2010","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 Feb. 2010","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Turbo channel estimation and equalization of STBC-OFDM system over time-varying wireless channels","confLoc":"Cholula, Puebla, Mexico","sourcePdf":"11paper.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055585S","chronDate":"22-24 Feb. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5433810","isNumber":"5440746","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5433810","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5440746","articleId":"5440796","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":5440800,"authors":[{"name":"Lal C Godara","affiliation":["School of Engineering and Information Technology, University of New South Wales, Canberra, ACT, Australia"],"firstName":"Lal C","lastName":"Godara","id":"37298901800"},{"name":"Presila Israt","affiliation":["School of Engineering and Information Technology, University of New South Wales, Canberra, ACT, Australia"],"firstName":"Presila","lastName":"Israt","id":"37391862100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5352-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-5353-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5440800","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":63},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5440800","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interference cancellation","Delay","Signal processing","Australia","Narrowband","Filters","Noise measurement","Signal to noise ratio","Information technology","Noise cancellation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["broadband networks","interference suppression"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["postbeamformer interference canceller","residual interference","channel noise canceller","broadband directional sources","steering delays","PIC processor"]}],"doi":"10.1109/CONIELECOMP.2010.5440800","publicationTitle":"2010 20th International Conference on Electronics Communications and Computers (CONIELECOMP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 20th International Conference on Electronics Communications and Computers (CONIELECOMP)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5433810/5440746/05440800.pdf","startPage":"26","endPage":"30","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CONIELECOMP.2010.5440800","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5440746","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A stearable broadband postbeamformer interference canceller with negligible residual interference","abstract":"A postbeamformer interference canceller (PIC) is a single channel noise canceller and cancels interference by forming two beams.

As the number of acquired OCT volumes increases, automating the OCT image analysis is becoming increasingly relevant. In this paper, a method for automated characterization of the normal macular appearance in spectral domain OCT (SD-OCT) volumes is reported together with a general approach for local retinal abnormality detection. Ten intraretinal layers are first automatically segmented and the 3-D image dataset flattened to remove motion-based artifacts. From the flattened OCT data, 23 features are extracted in each layer locally to characterize texture and thickness properties across the macula. The normal ranges of layer-specific feature variations have been derived from 13 SD-OCT volumes depicting normal retinas. Abnormalities are then detected by classifying the local differences between the normal appearance and the retinal measures in question. This approach was applied to determine footprints of fluid-filled regions-SEADs (Symptomatic Exudate-Associated Derangements)-in 78 SD-OCT volumes from 23 repeatedly imaged patients with choroidal neovascularization (CNV), intra-, and sub-retinal fluid and pigment epithelial detachment. The automated SEAD footprint detection method was validated against an independent standard obtained using an interactive 3-D SEAD segmentation approach. An area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve of 0.961 ? 0.012 was obtained for the classification of vertical, cross-layer, macular columns. A study performed on 12 pairs of OCT volumes obtained from the same eye on the same day shows that the repeatability of the automated method is comparable to that of the human experts. This work demonstrates that useful 3-D textural information can be extracted from SD-OCT scans and-together with an anatomical atlas of normal retinas-can be used for clinically important applications.","doi":"10.1109/TMI.2010.2047023","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMI.2010.2047023","startPage":"1321","endPage":"1330","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","pdfPath":"/iel5/42/5475425/05440910.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5475425","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Three-Dimensional Analysis of Retinal Layer Texture: Identification of Fluid-Filled Regions in SD-OCT of the Macula","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 April 2010","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2010","displayDocTitle":"Three-Dimensional Analysis of Retinal Layer Texture: Identification of Fluid-Filled Regions in SD-OCT of the Macula","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2010","dateOfInsertion":"01 June 2010","volume":"29","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5440910/","accessionNumber":"11328479","pubMedId":"20363675","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5440910/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Three-Dimensional Analysis of Retinal Layer Texture: Identification of Fluid-Filled Regions in SD-OCT of the Macula","sourcePdf":"tmi-gquellec-2047023.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.107205S","chronDate":"June  2010","xplore-pub-id":"42","isNumber":"5475425","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"42","citationCount":"130","xplore-issue":"5475425","articleId":"5440910","onlineDate":"01 April 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":5440917,"authors":[{"name":"Konrad Kowalczyk","affiliation":["Sonic Arts Research Centre (SARC), Queen's University, Belfast, UK","Multimedia Communications and Signal Processing (LMS), University of Erlangen Nuremberg, Erlangen, Germany"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/10376/5594819/5440917/5440917-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Konrad Kowalczyk received the B.Eng. and M.Sc. degrees from AGH University of Science and Technology, Krakow, Poland, in 2005 and the Ph.D. degree in electronics and electrical engineering from the Sonic Arts Research Centre, Queen's University, Belfast, U.K., with a thesis on numerical modeling of room acoustics.","He was a Visiting Ph.D. Student at CCRMA, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, in 2007 and at the University of York, York, U.K., in 2008.

The results indicate that the proposed 3-D interpolated wideband and isotropic schemes outperform directly related techniques based on Yee's staggered grid and standard digital waveguide mesh, and that the boundary formulations generally have properties that are similar to that of the basic scheme used.","doi":"10.1109/TASL.2010.2045179","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/10376/5594819/05440917.pdf","startPage":"34","endPage":"46","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TASL.2010.2045179","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5594819","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Room Acoustics Simulation Using 3-D Compact Explicit FDTD Schemes","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5440917","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 April 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5440917/","displayDocTitle":"Room Acoustics Simulation Using 3-D Compact Explicit FDTD Schemes","volume":"19","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2011","accessionNumber":"11561099","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5440917/","dateOfInsertion":"04 October 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Room Acoustics Simulation Using 3-D Compact Explicit FDTD Schemes","sourcePdf":"18tasl05-kkowalczyk-2045179-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.087023S","chronDate":"Jan.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"10376","isNumber":"5594819","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10376","citationCount":"74","xplore-issue":"5594819","articleId":"5440917","onlineDate":"01 April 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5440921,"authors":[{"name":"Hongbin Zhang","affiliation":["School of Electronic Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology, Chengdu, China","Department of Manufacturing Engineering and Engineering Management, City University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Hongbin","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37280795900"},{"name":"Chuangyin Dang","affiliation":["Manufacturing Engineering and Engineering Management, City University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Chuangyin","lastName":"Dang","id":"37401866900"},{"name":"Jian Zhang","affiliation":["School of Automation Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Jian","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37407600300"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1083-4419"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0492"}],"articleNumber":"5440921","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":46,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":754},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Systems, Man, and Cybernetics Society","url":"http://www.ieeesmc.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interconnected systems","Filters","Fuzzy systems","Delay effects","Filtering","Fuzzy control","Control systems","Manufacturing","Research and development management","Large-scale systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["asymptotic stability","decentralised control","delays","fuzzy set theory","H\u221e control","linear matrix inequalities","nonlinear control systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decentralized fuzzy H\u221e filtering","nonlinear interconnected systems","multiple time delays","T-S fuzzy models","asymptotic stability","filtering error system","linear matrix inequalities"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Decentralized","$H_{\\infty}$ filter","multiple time delays","nonlinear interconnected system","Takagi\u2013Sugeno (T-S) fuzzy model"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Algorithms","Computer Simulation","Fuzzy Logic","Models, Theoretical","Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted","Time Factors"]}],"abstract":"In general, due to the interaction among subsystems, it is difficult to design an \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">H</i>\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">\u221e</sub>\n filter for nonlinear interconnected systems.

They are based on a new method for estimating the acoustical transfer function ratios in the presence of stationary noise. The estimation method relies on solving a generalized eigenvalue problem in each frequency bin. An adaptive eigenvector tracking utilizing the power iteration method is employed and shown to achieve a high convergence speed. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed beamformer leads to better noise and interference reduction and reduced speech distortions compared to other blocking matrix designs from the literature.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/10376/5594819/05440931.pdf","startPage":"206","endPage":"219","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","doi":"10.1109/TASL.2010.2047324","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TASL.2010.2047324","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5594819","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5440931","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Speech Enhancement With a GSC-Like Structure Employing Eigenvector-Based Transfer Function Ratios Estimation","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Speech enhancement","Transfer functions","Frequency estimation","Noise cancellation","Signal to noise ratio","Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","Convergence","Noise reduction","Interference","Acoustic distortion"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","iterative methods","reverberation","speech enhancement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["speech enhancement","eigenvector-based transfer function ratios estimation","blocking matrix","beamformer design","generalized sidelobe canceler","reverberant enclosure","acoustical transfer function ratio","stationary noise","adaptive eigenvector tracking","power iteration method","interference reduction","reduced speech distortions"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Acoustical transfer function ratios","generalized eigenvalue problem","generalized sidelobe canceler (GSC)","microphone array signal processing","speech enhancement"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5440931/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 April 2010","displayDocTitle":"Speech Enhancement With a GSC-Like Structure Employing Eigenvector-Based Transfer Function Ratios Estimation","volume":"19","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/5440931/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2011","accessionNumber":"11561089","dateOfInsertion":"04 October 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Speech Enhancement With a GSC-Like Structure Employing Eigenvector-Based Transfer Function Ratios Estimation","sourcePdf":"18tasl07-akrueger-2047324-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.082507S","chronDate":"Jan.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"10376","isNumber":"5594819","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10376","citationCount":"51","xplore-issue":"5594819","articleId":"5440931","onlineDate":"01 April 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5440935,"authors":[{"name":"Xiang Wang","affiliation":["Institute of Computer Science and Technology, Peking University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Xiang","lastName":"Wang","id":"37407490000"},{"name":"Xiaolong Li","affiliation":["Institute of Computer Science and Technology, Peking University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Xiaolong","lastName":"Li","id":"37406910500"},{"name":"Bin Yang","affiliation":["Institute of Computer Science and Technology, Peking University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Bin","lastName":"Yang","id":"37399885100"},{"name":"Zongming Guo","affiliation":["Institute of Computer Science and Technology, Peking University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Zongming","lastName":"Guo","id":"37287726400"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1070-9908"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2361"}],"articleNumber":"5440935","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":132,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":1013},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.signalprocessingsociety.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Watermarking","Image coding","Histograms","Computer science"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["difference equations","image resolution","transforms","watermarking"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["generalized integer transform","reversible image watermarking","Tian difference expansion technique","payload-dependent location map","pixel blocks","embeddable blocks","less distortion"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Integer transform","reversible watermarking"]}],"abstract":"In this letter, an efficient integer transform based reversible watermarking is proposed.

This paper formulates the ASS problem in the form of a permutation problem and proposes a new solution framework that makes the first attempt at using an ant colony system (ACS) algorithm based on the receding horizon control (RHC) to solve it. The resultant RHC-improved ACS algorithm for the ASS problem (termed the RHC-ACS-ASS algorithm) is robust, effective, and efficient, not only due to that the ACS algorithm has a strong global search ability and has been proven to be suitable for these kinds of NP-hard problems but also due to that the RHC technique can divide the problem with receding time windows to reduce the computational burden and enhance the solution's quality. The RHC-ACS-ASS algorithm is extensively tested on the cases from the literatures and the cases randomly generated. Comprehensive investigations are also made for the evaluation of the influences of ACS and RHC parameters on the performance of the algorithm. Moreover, the proposed algorithm is further enhanced by using a two-opt exchange heuristic local search. Experimental results verify that the proposed RHC-ACS-ASS algorithm generally outperforms ordinary ACS without using the RHC technique and genetic algorithms (GAs) in solving the ASS problems and offers high robustness, effectiveness, and efficiency.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Efficient Ant Colony System Based on Receding Horizon Control for the Aircraft Arrival Sequencing and Scheduling Problem","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems","doi":"10.1109/TITS.2010.2044793","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/6979/5475419/05440937.pdf","startPage":"399","endPage":"412","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TITS.2010.2044793","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5475419","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5440937","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5440937/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 April 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2010","displayDocTitle":"An Efficient Ant Colony System Based on Receding Horizon Control for the Aircraft Arrival Sequencing and Scheduling Problem","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"11","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/5440937/","dateOfInsertion":"01 June 2010","publicationDate":"June 2010","accessionNumber":"11328298","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Efficient Ant Colony System Based on Receding Horizon Control for the Aircraft Arrival Sequencing and Scheduling Problem","sourcePdf":"tits-zhang-2044793.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.123341S","chronDate":"June  2010","xplore-pub-id":"6979","isNumber":"5475419","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6979","citationCount":"93","xplore-issue":"5475419","articleId":"5440937","onlineDate":"01 April 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5440939,"authors":[{"name":"Yuri I.

In particular, the introduced \u201csingle-cluster\u201d criterion provides accurate \u201cambiguity bounds\u201d for the outliers.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5440939/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 April 2010","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11432898","volume":"58","issue":"7","htmlLink":"/document/5440939/","publicationDate":"July 2010","dateOfInsertion":"14 June 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Detection\u2013Estimation of Very Close Emitters: Performance Breakdown, Ambiguity, and General Statistical Analysis of Maximum-Likelihood Estimation","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Detection\u2013Estimation of Very Close Emitters: Performance Breakdown, Ambiguity, and General Statistical Analysis of Maximum-Likelihood Estimation","sourcePdf":"58tsp07-bjohnson-2047334.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.135187S","chronDate":"July  2010","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"5484906","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"5484906","articleId":"5440939","onlineDate":"01 April 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":5440941,"authors":[{"name":"Nelson M.

A tiny RFID tag is attached to a mobile object, which can be scanned and recognized by a reader. RFID offers opportunities for real-time item identification and inventory tracking. For applications using resource-restricted RFID tags and mobile hand-held readers, however, various risks could threaten their abilities to provide essential services to users. High mobility of the RFID system components and the open nature make an RFID system vulnerable to various attacks. Currently, although some techniques exist that might help improve survivability; there is still no complete proposal on survivability of an RFID system despite its growing popularity and importance in many applications. In this paper, we study survivability issues related to RFID systems and survey existing techniques whose usability and adaptability toward survivability would be beneficial. Survivability is defined as the ability of a system to continuously provide essential services to support the system's mission even in the presence of malicious attacks or system failures.

Thereby, the traffic flow on main roads can partially be acquired, while data from the major part of the entire road network are not available. Today's optical sensor systems on satellites provide large-area images with 1-m resolution and better, which can deliver complement information to traditional acquired data. In this paper, we present an approach for automatic vehicle detection from optical satellite images. Therefore, hypotheses for single vehicles are generated using adaptive boosting in combination with Haar-like features. Additionally, vehicle queues are detected using a line extraction technique since grouped vehicles are merged to either dark or bright ribbons. Utilizing robust parameter estimation, single vehicles are determined within those vehicle queues. The combination of implicit modeling and the use of \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">a priori</i>\n knowledge of typical vehicle constellation leads to an enhanced overall completeness compared to approaches which are only based on statistical classification techniques. Thus, a detection rate of over 80% is possible with very high reliability. Furthermore, an approach for movement estimation of the detected vehicle is described, which allows the distinction of moving and stationary traffic. Thus, even an estimate for vehicles' speed is possible, which gives additional information about the traffic condition at image acquisition time.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Vehicle Detection in Very High Resolution Satellite Images of City Areas","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","doi":"10.1109/TGRS.2010.2043109","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel5/36/5487390/05440956.pdf","startPage":"2795","endPage":"2806","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2010.2043109","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5487390","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5440956","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5440956/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 April 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2010","displayDocTitle":"Vehicle Detection in Very High Resolution Satellite Images of City Areas","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"48","issue":"7","htmlLink":"/document/5440956/","dateOfInsertion":"17 June 2010","publicationDate":"July 2010","accessionNumber":"11442187","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Vehicle Detection in Very High Resolution Satellite Images of City Areas","sourcePdf":"tgrs-leitloff-2043109.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.155859S","chronDate":"July  2010","xplore-pub-id":"36","isNumber":"5487390","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"110","xplore-issue":"5487390","articleId":"5440956","onlineDate":"01 April 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5440958,"authors":[{"name":"Yu Qiao","affiliation":["Shenzhen Institute of Advanced Technology, Chinese Academy and Sciences, Shenzhen, China"],"firstName":"Yu","lastName":"Qiao","id":"37401299900"},{"name":"Nobuaki Minematsu","affiliation":["Graduate School of Information Science and Technology, University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Nobuaki","lastName":"Minematsu","id":"37274034300"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1053-587X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0476"}],"articleNumber":"5440958","dbTime":"14 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":35,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":536},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.signalprocessingsociety.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Statistical distributions","Speech recognition","Information processing","Information theory","Information science","Stochastic processes","Kernel","Pattern recognition","Performance analysis","Hidden Markov models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Gaussian processes","maximum likelihood estimation","speech recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["f-divergence","speech recognition","invertible transformation","Gaussian mixture","invariant structural representation","maximum likelihood decomposition","Japanese vowel utterances"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":[" $f$-divergence","invariance to transformation","speech recognition","structural representation"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TSP.2010.2047340","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/5484906/05440958.pdf","startPage":"3884","endPage":"3890","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5484906","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2010.2047340","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5440958","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Study on Invariance of --Divergence and Its Application to Speech Recognition","abstract":"Identifying features invariant to certain transformations is a fundamental problem in the fields of signal processing and pattern recognition.

However, at high rotor velocity, the commutator issues high frequency control signals which may not be precisely followed by the motor driver/amplifier due to its finite bandwidth. As a result, pulsation torque may appear at high velocities even though the commutator is calibrated to perfectly compensate the motor's position nonlinearity. This brief describes a modification to the commutation law based on Fourier coefficients in order to eliminate the velocity induce torque ripple. This is made possible by expressing the motor's current waveform as a function of not only the rotor angle but also the velocity and taking into account the amplifier dynamics model in the control design. A case study is appended that illustrates the proposed commutator nested inside a motion controller is able to eliminate the pulsation torque and velocity fluctuation at high velocities even if a low bandwidth amplifier is employed.","doi":"10.1109/TCST.2010.2045502","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCST.2010.2045502","startPage":"391","endPage":"397","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Control Systems Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/87/5715605/05440969.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Control Systems Technology","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5715605","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Ripple Suppression of BLDC Motors With Finite Driver/Amplifer Bandwidth at High Velocity","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 April 2010","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2011","displayDocTitle":"Ripple Suppression of BLDC Motors With Finite Driver/Amplifer Bandwidth at High Velocity","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2011","dateOfInsertion":"17 February 2011","volume":"19","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5440969/","accessionNumber":"11832652","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5440969/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Ripple Suppression of BLDC Motors With Finite Driver/Amplifer Bandwidth at High Velocity","sourcePdf":"tcst-faghili-2045502-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.073204S","chronDate":"March  2011","xplore-pub-id":"87","isNumber":"5715605","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"87","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"5715605","articleId":"5440969","onlineDate":"01 April 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-10"},{"_id":5440972,"authors":[{"name":"Qi Zhou","affiliation":["Department of Electronic and Computer Engineering, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Qi","lastName":"Zhou","id":"37400757400"},{"name":"King-Yuen Wong","affiliation":["Department of Electronic and Computer Engineering, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"King-Yuen","lastName":"Wong","id":"37291561900"},{"name":"Wanjun Chen","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Electronic Thin Films and Integrated Devices, University of Electronic Science and Technology, Chengdu, China","Department of Electronic and Computer Engineering, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Wanjun","lastName":"Chen","id":"37404839200"},{"name":"Kevin J.

The motion estimation algorithm presented in , which is used in the MC-FRUC method proposed in this paper, provides unidirectional motion trajectories. The advantage of this motion estimation algorithm, besides its accuracy, is that it provides information on occlusions. However, motion compensation along unidirectional motion trajectories yields overlaps, holes, and blocking artifacts. To solve these problems, this paper presents two new algorithms for unidirectional motion-compensated frame interpolation: irregular-grid expanded-block weighted motion compensation (IEWMC) and block-wise directional hole interpolation (BDHI). The IEWMC is used to reduce the blocking artifacts and solve the problem of overlapping blocks. The BDHI preserves local texture and edges while filling holes. Experimental results show that the IEWMC outperforms conventional motion compensation, and the BDHI is better than the repeated median filter that is often used to fill holes. The performance of the proposed MC-FRUC, that uses the two new algorithms and the unidirectional motion estimation algorithm, is evaluated against three existing MC-FRUC techniques: a typical bi-directional algorithm, an object-based algorithm, and a commercial plug-in product. Experimental results show that the quality of the pictures interpolated using the proposed MC-FRUC method is much higher than those interpolated using the three existing MC-FRUC techniques.","doi":"10.1109/TBC.2010.2043895","startPage":"142","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Broadcasting","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Broadcasting","pdfPath":"/iel5/11/5471739/05440975.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TBC.2010.2043895","endPage":"149","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5471739","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Motion-Compensated Frame Rate Up-Conversion\u2014Part II: New Algorithms for Frame Interpolation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5440975/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 April 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2010","displayDocTitle":"Motion-Compensated Frame Rate Up-Conversion\u2014Part II: New Algorithms for Frame Interpolation","volume":"56","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/5440975/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"11341178","dateOfInsertion":"24 May 2010","publicationDate":"June 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Motion-Compensated Frame Rate Up-Conversion\u2014Part II: New Algorithms for Frame Interpolation","sourcePdf":"tbc-wang-2043895.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.113058S","chronDate":"June  2010","xplore-pub-id":"11","isNumber":"5471739","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"11","citationCount":"79","xplore-issue":"5471739","articleId":"5440975","onlineDate":"01 April 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5440980,"authors":[{"name":"Ali Mehrizi-Sani","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Toronto, Toronto, ONT, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/59/5598499/5440980/5440980-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Ali Mehrizi-Sani (S'05\u2013GS'08) received the B.Sc. degree in electrical engineering from Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Iran, the B.Sc. degree in petroleum engineering from Sharif University of Technology in collaboration with Petroleum University of Technology, Ahwaz, Iran, both in 2005, and the M.Sc. degree in electrical and computer engineering from the University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, MB, Canada, in 2007.

However, a serious drawback of the OFDM system is the high peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR), which may severely affect the power efficiency of RF power amplifiers. In this paper, we propose a simple method to reduce the PAPR of MIMO-OFDM signals based on the use of unused subcarriers. Instead of processing the signals at each transmitter separately, a peak cancelling signal is generated at one antenna and is then applied to all the others with only simple modifications. Simulation has shown that a minimum 2 dB reduction in PAPR can be achieved for all transmit signals using this approach. As the signal processing is nearly all done at a single transmitter, repetition of the operations at each transmitter is avoided, and therefore the overall cost of the system can be significantly reduced.","doi":"10.1109/IMWS.2010.5441004","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Microwave Workshop Series on RF Front-ends for Software Defined and Cognitive Radio Solutions (IMWS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Microwave Workshop Series on RF Front-ends for Software Defined and Cognitive Radio Solutions (IMWS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5438529/5440961/05441004.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IMWS.2010.5441004","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5440961","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Peak-to-average power ratio reduction of SFBC MIMO-OFDM signals using unused tones","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5441004","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Peak-to-average power ratio reduction of SFBC MIMO-OFDM signals using unused tones","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-23 Feb. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5441004/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"22-23 Feb. 2010","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2010","accessionNumber":"11231344","dateOfInsertion":"12 April 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5441004/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Peak-to-average power ratio reduction of SFBC MIMO-OFDM signals using unused tones","confLoc":"Aveiro, Portugal","sourcePdf":"20S03P01paperID63.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.040855S","chronDate":"22-23 Feb. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5438529","isNumber":"5440961","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5438529","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5440961","articleId":"5441004","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5441005,"authors":[{"name":"G.

This feature is aimed at optimizing the energy requirement of the PAs. Two architectures and technologies have been considered. The first is based on SiGe HBTs with different sizes, it shows a CW PAE around 38% for the state 1 and 42% for state 2 respectively when terminated with optimum terminations. This circuit is conceived to be involved in a 1-bit step envelope tracking architecture, in which a factor two of improvement in terms of average PAE has been demonstrated. The second technique consists in controlling the output back-off of a GaN HEMT PA resulting in a significant increase of the efficiency through an, in principle, arbitrary power dynamic range. The prototype demonstrated an average PAE enhancement at 7 dB back-off of 2.1 and a maximum linear output power can be achieved up to 30 dBm, when driven by a 2.14 GHz WCDMA signal.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5440961","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IMWS.2010.5441007","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Microwave Workshop Series on RF Front-ends for Software Defined and Cognitive Radio Solutions (IMWS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Microwave Workshop Series on RF Front-ends for Software Defined and Cognitive Radio Solutions (IMWS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5438529/5440961/05441007.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","doi":"10.1109/IMWS.2010.5441007","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Power amplifier architectures with discrete power control for high average efficiency","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-23 Feb. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Power amplifier architectures with discrete power control for high average efficiency","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"22-23 Feb. 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5441007/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2010","accessionNumber":"11231358","dateOfInsertion":"12 April 2010","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5441007/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Power amplifier architectures with discrete power control for high average efficiency","confLoc":"Aveiro, Portugal","sourcePdf":"15S02P01paperID85.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.039346S","chronDate":"22-23 Feb. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5438529","isNumber":"5440961","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5438529","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5440961","articleId":"5441007","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":5441008,"authors":[{"name":"C\u00e9sar S\u00e1nchez-P\u00e9rez","affiliation":["Aragon Institute for Engineering Research (I3A), University of Zaragoza, Zaragoza, Spain"],"firstName":"C\u00e9sar","lastName":"S\u00e1nchez-P\u00e9rez","id":"38274871800"},{"name":"Jes\u00fas de Mingo","affiliation":["Aragon Institute for Engineering Research (I3A), University of Zaragoza, Zaragoza, Spain"],"firstName":"Jes\u00fas","lastName":"de Mingo","id":"37284816600"},{"name":"Paloma Garc\u00eda-D\u00facar","affiliation":["Aragon Institute for Engineering Research (I3A), University of Zaragoza, Zaragoza, Spain"],"firstName":"Paloma","lastName":"Garc\u00eda-D\u00facar","id":"37293754100"},{"name":"Pedro L.

Complexity increases if room consists of furniture's and other objects beside desired target. Further detection of desired target becomes complex with the presence of window in back wall of room. Thus in this paper, effect of presence of window in back wall of room is investigated on detection and imaging. A detection technique is proposed in which signal processing technique is applied to extract the target information from clutter signal. A back projection imaging technique is applied to image the target. For this purpose, indigenously a TWI system based on step frequency continuous wave (SFCW) principle is developed in ultra wide band (UWB) range of frequency (i.e., 3.95 GHz to 5.85 GHz), plywood considered as wall and metallic plate is considered as target behind the plywood wall.

Several power control updating algorithms have been proposed to deal with this problem. One of the commonly used algorithms is proposed by Zander that drives all the mobiles to achieve the system threshold signal to interference ratio (SIR), that is necessary for a mobile to get the access of base station. This algorithm deals with the link gain matrix associated with the system. Removal policy is applied which removes a mobile from the network if it fails achieve threshold value after being given several trials. The system is rebalanced by changing the link gain matrix. This increases the capacity as new incoming users can be served by the system. In this paper, a new power updating algorithm for cellular system is proposed and simulated to show that mobiles converges faster in terms of number of iterations required to get system threshold.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Emerging Trends in Electronic and Photonic Devices & Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5436188/5441033/05441119.pdf","startPage":"274","endPage":"277","publicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Emerging Trends in Electronic and Photonic Devices & Systems","doi":"10.1109/ELECTRO.2009.5441119","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ELECTRO.2009.5441119","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5441033","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5441119","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improvement in power updating algorithm in wireless DS-CDMA networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multiaccess communication","Power control","Interference","Base stations","Transmitters","Power system modeling","Fading","Shadow mapping","Mobile communication","Batteries"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiple access"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power updating algorithm","wireless DS-CDMA networks","cellular systems","link gain matrix","removal policy","signal to interference ratio"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["CDMA","BS","SIR"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5441119/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 Dec. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Improvement in power updating algorithm in wireless DS-CDMA networks","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5441119/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","accessionNumber":"11208469","dateOfInsertion":"01 April 2010","conferenceDate":"22-24 Dec. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improvement in power updating algorithm in wireless DS-CDMA networks","confLoc":"Varanasi, India","sourcePdf":"SN070.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056797S","chronDate":"22-24 Dec. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5436188","isNumber":"5441033","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5436188","xplore-issue":"5441033","articleId":"5441119","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5441120,"authors":[{"name":"Sindhu Hak Gupta","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Communication, ASET, Amity University, Noida, India"],"firstName":"Sindhu Hak","lastName":"Gupta","id":"37404733500"},{"name":"Bindya Virmani","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Communication, ASET, Amity University, Noida, India"],"firstName":"Bindya","lastName":"Virmani","id":"37398436900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4846-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5441120","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":983},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5441120","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Parity check codes","WiMAX","Turbo codes","Block codes","Error correction codes","Convolution","Frequency","Convolutional codes","Code standards","Decoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["3G mobile communication","block codes","cellular radio","error correction codes","linear codes","parity check codes","WiMax","wireless LAN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["LDPC codes","Wi-Fi technologies","WiMAX technologies","IEEE 802.16 standards","IMT 2000 Technologies","low density parity check codes","single frequency network","systematic linear block codes","error correcting codes","Shannon limit","global cellular wireless standards"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Convolutional Codes","Turbo Codes","LDPC","Tanner","graphs","Regular/Irregular codes","802.16e"]}],"abstract":"With increasing demand of low complexity, higher performance systems ITU adopted Wi-Fi and Wi-Max as one of the IMT 2000 Technologies. Wi-Fi and Wi-Max technologies are major global cellular wireless standards. IEEE 802.16e standards use LDPC (Low Density Parity Check) based SFN (Single Frequency Network) networks. These codes were introduced in 1962 by Gallager. LDPC codes for Wi-max and Wi-Fi is based on the set of one or more fundamental LDPC codes, each of which is systematic linear block codes. These codes can accommodate various code rates and packet sizes. LDPC with the help of high frequency powerful processors is error correcting codes which allows transmission at rates in close proximity to Shannon's limit for large block length.

In this paper, a novel power sharing technique is proposed for different users to improve the system performance. The proposed technique is based on use of variable amplitude of subcarriers (VAS). Power can be increased to the users who are crossing the reference boundary (RB) and moving farther towards foot print (FP) of a cell. In this way the users having weak SNR can sustain their call even in multipath fading environment. Assuming knowledge of the instantaneous channel gain estimation for all users, we propose an OFDM dynamic adaptive subcarriers scheme to maintain optimum SNR level of the subchannels which are in deep fade. Simulation results show that the performance of the proposed algorithm is much better than that of other algorithms.","doi":"10.1109/ELECTRO.2009.5441121","publicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Emerging Trends in Electronic and Photonic Devices & Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Emerging Trends in Electronic and Photonic Devices & Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5436188/5441033/05441121.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ELECTRO.2009.5441121","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5441033","startPage":"266","endPage":"269","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Shared power allocation among subcarriers of OFDM systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5441121","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Shared power allocation among subcarriers of OFDM systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 Dec. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5441121/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"22-24 Dec. 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","accessionNumber":"11208471","dateOfInsertion":"01 April 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5441121/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Shared power allocation among subcarriers of OFDM systems","confLoc":"Varanasi, India","sourcePdf":"SN068.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072467S","chronDate":"22-24 Dec. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5436188","isNumber":"5441033","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5436188","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5441033","articleId":"5441121","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5441133,"authors":[{"name":"Deepak Mishra","affiliation":["Onboard Signal Processing Division, Space Applications Centre, Ahmedabad, India"],"firstName":"Deepak","lastName":"Mishra","id":"37391543500"},{"name":"Aasiya Topiwala","affiliation":["Onboard Signal Processing Division, Space Applications Centre, Ahmedabad, India"],"firstName":"Aasiya","lastName":"Topiwala","id":"37398445800"},{"name":"K.S.

The proposed power amplifier can deliver 23.5 dBm output power to a 50\u03a9 load at 950 MHz with 41% power-added efficiency (PAE) from 1.8 V supply voltage.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5441167/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 Dec. 2009","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"22-24 Dec. 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5441167/","dateOfInsertion":"01 April 2010","publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","accessionNumber":"11208495","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A 950-MHz fully differential class-E power amplifier in 0.18\u00b5m CMOS for wireless communications","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A 950-MHz fully differential class-E power amplifier in 0.18\u00b5m CMOS for wireless communications","confLoc":"Varanasi, India","sourcePdf":"SN022.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061002S","chronDate":"22-24 Dec. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5436188","isNumber":"5441033","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5436188","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5441033","articleId":"5441167","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5441173,"authors":[{"name":"Tapas Dutta","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Computer Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology Roorkee, Roorkee, India"],"firstName":"Tapas","lastName":"Dutta","id":"37410136200"},{"name":"Sudeb Dasgupta","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Computer Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology Roorkee, Roorkee, India"],"firstName":"Sudeb","lastName":"Dasgupta","id":"37405493100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4846-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5441173","dbTime":"14 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":429},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5441173","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["FinFETs","Design optimization","Random access memory","Doping","Dielectric devices","Semiconductor process modeling","Degradation","Gate leakage","Photonics","Application software"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MOSFET","nanofabrication","SRAM chips"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["double gate underlap FinFET device optimization","SRAM design","ITRS targets","source-drain doping engineering","gate dielectric engineering","spacer engineering","metal gate work function engineering","quantum mechanical effects","gate lengths","conventional butterfly curves","N-curves","size 15 nm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Double Gate","Underlap FinFET","Device Optimization","SRAM","Noise Margins"]}],"abstract":"In this work an attempt has been made to optimize the double gate underlap FinFET devices so as to approach the ITRS targets for the year 2015 for HP (High Performance) applications.

With the presented operand reduction scheme, the proposed scalable architecture can operate at high speeds and suitable data paths can be chosen for specific applications.

With the growing size and state-space of modern digital hardware designs, the conciseness of this mathematical model is of paramount importance in extending the scalability of those tools, provided that the compression does not come at the cost of reduced performance. Quantified Boolean Formula satisfiability (QBF) is a powerful generalization of Boolean satisfiability (SAT). It also belongs to the same complexity class as many CAD problems dealing with sequential circuits, which makes it a natural candidate for encoding such problems. This work proposes a succinct QBF encoding for modeling sequential circuit behavior. The encoding is parametrized and further compression is achieved using time-frame windowing. Comprehensive hardware constructions are used to illustrate the proposed encodings. Three notable CAD problems, namely bounded model checking, design debugging and sequential test pattern generation, are encoded as QBF instances to demonstrate the robustness and practicality of the proposed approach. Extensive experiments on OpenCore circuits show memory reductions in the order of 90 percent and demonstrate competitive runtimes compared to state-of-the-art SAT techniques. Furthermore, the number of solved instances is increased by 16 percent.

We propose in this paper, a strategy to minimize the total transmit power in a decode-and-forward (DF) multi-user, multi-relay cooperative uplink, such that each user satisfies its quality-of-service (QoS) data rate. Each user in the proposed system transmits its own data towards the base station and also serves as a relay for other users. The base station assigns one or more relays to each user in order to minimize total power in the uplink. The relay selection is based upon the instantaneous user to base station channels, inter-user channels and also the target rates of the users. The simulation results indicate significant power savings over a non-cooperative uplink, under proposed joint relay selection and power minimization algorithm in a DF cooperative uplink when using a space-time coded cooperative diversity.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2010.04.080175","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/5441339/05441342.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2010.04.080175","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5441339","startPage":"1255","endPage":"1260","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint power allocation and relay selection for multiuser cooperative communication","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5441342","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Joint power allocation and relay selection for multiuser cooperative communication","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5441342/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 April 2010","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"9","issue":"4","publicationDate":"April 2010","accessionNumber":"11243510","dateOfInsertion":"15 April 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5441342/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint power allocation and relay selection for multiuser cooperative communication","sourcePdf":"1255-tw1004-vardhe.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.05942S","chronDate":"April  2010","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"5441339","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"93","xplore-issue":"5441339","articleId":"5441342","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5441344,"authors":[{"name":"Seyed Ali Ahmadzadeh","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Waterloo, Waterloo, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Seyed Ali","lastName":"Ahmadzadeh","id":"38557184100"},{"name":"Seyed Abolfazl Motahari","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Waterloo, Waterloo, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Seyed Abolfazl","lastName":"Motahari","id":"38556591400"},{"name":"Amir K.

Motivated by the concept of signal space diversity, this paper introduces signal space cooperation, in which cooperation between the source and the relay is achieved using a novel constellation design. In this approach, the original constellation is expanded so that the expanded constellation consists of all possible combinations of different components of signal points in the original constellation. The expanded constellation enables the relay to extract the required information in order to effectively cooperate in the relay phase, and it helps the destination to efficiently combine received signals during the broadcast phase and the relay phase. The analytical study of the proposed scheme leads to the development of two design criteria for the constellation expansion. Numerical results depict superior performance in comparison with other cooperative schemes, such as the distributed turbo coded cooperative schemes and the trans-modulation scheme.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5441339","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2010.04.090059","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/5441339/05441344.pdf","startPage":"1266","endPage":"1271","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2010.04.090059","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Signal space cooperative communication","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2010","displayDocTitle":"Signal space cooperative communication","volume":"9","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/5441344/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"April 2010","accessionNumber":"11243512","dateOfInsertion":"15 April 2010","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5441344/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 April 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Signal space cooperative communication","sourcePdf":"1266-tw1004-ahmadzadeh.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.131846S","chronDate":"April  2010","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"5441339","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"39","xplore-issue":"5441339","articleId":"5441344","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":5441347,"authors":[{"name":"Muhammad Fainan Hanif","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Canterbury, Christchurch, New Zealand"],"firstName":"Muhammad Fainan","lastName":"Hanif","id":"37404282200"},{"name":"Peter J.

The obtained results indicate that the RSM is better suited than the GMEA and the LPNM to emulate the channel's autocorrelation function (ACF), whereas the latter two methods are more precise regarding the approximation of the envelope distribution. The results also show that the benefits of increasing the number of cisoids are more significant in the case of the RSM than in the case of the GMEA and LPNM. Owing to its simplicity and good performance, the RSM can be used to design flexible simulation platforms for the laboratory analysis of mobile communication systems operating in non-isotropic scattering environments.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/5441339/05441352.pdf","startPage":"1308","endPage":"1314","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2010.04.091198","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2010.04.091198","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5441339","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5441352","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The design of sum-of-cisoids rayleigh fading channel simulators assuming non-isotropic scattering conditions","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fading","Rayleigh scattering","Electromagnetic scattering","Mobile communication","Performance analysis","Narrowband","Autocorrelation","Electromagnetic modeling","MIMO","Computational modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mobile radio","Rayleigh channels","Rayleigh scattering"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["sum-of-cisoids design","Rayleigh fading channel simulators","nonisotropic scattering conditions","Riemann sum method","narrowband mobile Rayleigh fading channels","L\u00bf-norm method","generalized method of equal areas","autocorrelation function","mobile communication"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Channel simulators, mobile communications, non-isotropic scattering, fading channels, sum-of-cisoids, sum-of-sinusoids."]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5441352/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 April 2010","displayDocTitle":"The design of sum-of-cisoids rayleigh fading channel simulators assuming non-isotropic scattering conditions","volume":"9","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/5441352/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2010","accessionNumber":"11243520","dateOfInsertion":"15 April 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The design of sum-of-cisoids rayleigh fading channel simulators assuming non-isotropic scattering conditions","sourcePdf":"1308-tw1004-gutierrez.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.079035S","chronDate":"April  2010","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"5441339","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"30","xplore-issue":"5441339","articleId":"5441352","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5441354,"authors":[{"name":"Vinod Sharma","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Communication Engineering, IISc, Bangalore, India"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/5441339/5441354/5441354-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Vinod Sharma completed his BTech in 1978 from IIT Delhi and PhD in 1984 from CMU in Pittsburgh in Electrical Engg.

Furthermore, it can be used to model cascade multipath fading, which is relevant in, e.g., mobile-to-mobile communication scenarios. In this paper, we derive closed-form expressions for the bit error probability of two non-coherent transmission schemes over L diversity branches being subject to generalized \u03ba-fading. Specifically, focus is on binary differential phase-shift keying (DPSK) and binary non-coherent frequency-shift keying (FSK) modulation with (post-detection) equal-gain combining at the receiver. We also discuss the extension of our results to M-ary modulation schemes. Considering both independent and correlated fading across the L branches, we derive expressions for the asymptotic diversity order, which reveal an interesting interplay between the two fading parameters \u03ba and m. Moreover, we show that the diversity order of the considered non-coherent transmission schemes is the same as in the case of a coherent transmission scheme. Finally, numerical performance results are presented, and our analytical results are corroborated by means of Monte-Carlo simulations.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2010.04.090172","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/5441339/05441355.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2010.04.090172","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5441339","startPage":"1337","endPage":"1349","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the performance of non-coherent transmission schemes with equal-gain combining in generalized \u039a-fading","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5441355","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"On the performance of non-coherent transmission schemes with equal-gain combining in generalized \u039a-fading","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5441355/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 April 2010","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"9","issue":"4","publicationDate":"April 2010","accessionNumber":"11243523","dateOfInsertion":"15 April 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5441355/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the performance of non-coherent transmission schemes with equal-gain combining in generalized \u039a-fading","sourcePdf":"1337-tw1004-zhu.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.097945S","chronDate":"April  2010","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"5441339","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"26","xplore-issue":"5441339","articleId":"5441355","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5441362,"authors":[{"name":"Mahmudur Rahman","affiliation":["Department of Systems and Computer Engineering, Carleton University, Ottawa, ONT, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/5441339/5441362/5441362-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Mahmudur Rahman received his Bachelor of Science degree in Electrical & Electronic Engineering from Bangladesh University of Engineering & Technology (BUET), Dhaka, Bangladesh, in 1991.

Static or semi-static interference coordination based schemes provide enhanced cell-edge performance but with severe penalty to the overall cell throughput. Furthermore, static resource planning makes these schemes unsuitable for applications in which frequency planning is difficult, such as femtocell networks. In this paper, we present a novel dynamic interference avoidance scheme that makes use of inter-cell coordination in order to prevent excessive inter-cell interference, especially for cell or sector edge users that are most affected by inter-cell interference, with minimal or no impact on the network throughput. The proposed scheme is comprised of a two-level algorithm - one at the base station level and the other at a central controller to which a group of neighboring base stations are connected. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme outperforms the reference schemes, in which either coordination is not employed (reuse of 1) or employed in a static manner (reuse of 3 and fractional frequency reuse), in terms of cell edge throughput with a minimal impact on the network throughput and with some increase in complexity.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Enhancing cell-edge performance: a downlink dynamic interference avoidance scheme with inter-cell coordination","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2010.04.090256","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/5441339/05441362.pdf","startPage":"1414","endPage":"1425","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2010.04.090256","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5441339","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5441362","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5441362/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 April 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2010","displayDocTitle":"Enhancing cell-edge performance: a downlink dynamic interference avoidance scheme with inter-cell coordination","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"9","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/5441362/","dateOfInsertion":"15 April 2010","publicationDate":"April 2010","accessionNumber":"11243530","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Enhancing cell-edge performance: a downlink dynamic interference avoidance scheme with inter-cell coordination","sourcePdf":"1414-tw1004-rahman.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.074907S","chronDate":"April  2010","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"5441339","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"223","xplore-issue":"5441339","articleId":"5441362","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5441364,"authors":[{"name":"R.

The effectiveness of these adaptations depends on the amount of knowledge about the state of the network that is available to the radios. We examine the price of ignorance in topology control in a cognitive network with power- and spectral-efficiency objectives. We propose distributed algorithms that, if radios possess global knowledge, minimize both the maximum transmit power and the spectral footprint of the network. We show that while local (as opposed to global) knowledge has little effect on the maximum transmission power used by the network, it has a significant effect on the spectral performance. Furthermore, we show that due to the high cost of maintaining network knowledge for highly dynamic networks, the cost/performance tradeoff makes it advantageous for radios to operate under some degree of local knowledge, rather than global knowledge.We also propose distributed algorithms for power and frequency adaptations as radios join or leave the network, and assess how partial knowledge impacts the performance of these adaptations.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5441364/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 April 2010","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11243532","volume":"9","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/5441364/","publicationDate":"April 2010","dateOfInsertion":"15 April 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"The price of ignorance: distributed topology control in cognitive networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The price of ignorance: distributed topology control in cognitive networks","sourcePdf":"1434-tw1004-komali.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.063805S","chronDate":"April  2010","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"5441339","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"36","xplore-issue":"5441339","articleId":"5441364","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5441366,"authors":[{"name":"Luca Venturino","affiliation":["DAEIMI, Universit\u00e0 degli Studi di Cassino, Frosinone, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/5441339/5441366/5441366-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Luca Venturino (S'03, M'06) received the Ph.D. degree in Electrical Engineering in 2006 from the University of Cassino, Italy.

Assuming that each base station serves multiple single-antenna mobiles via space-division multiple-access, we jointly optimize the linear beam-vectors across a set of coordinated cells and resource slots: the objective function to be maximized is the instantaneous weighted sum-rate subject to per-base-station power constraints. After deriving the general structure of the optimal beam-vectors, a novel iterative algorithm is presented which attempts to solve the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions of the non-convex problem at hand.

The key concept behind a prominent cooperative diversity based protocol, namely, Partner-based Hierarchical Mobile IPv6 (PHMIPv6), is to enable mobile nodes anticipate handover events by selecting suitable partners to communicate on their behalves with Mobility Anchor Points (MAPs). In the original design of PHMIPv6, mobile hosts choose partners based on their signal strength. Such a naive selection procedure may lead to scenarios where mobile hosts lose communication with the selected partners before the completion of the handoff operations. In addition, PHMIPv6 overlooks security considerations, which can easily lead to vulnerable mobile hosts and/or partner entities. As a solution to these two shortcomings of PHMIPv6, this paper first proposes an extended version of PHMIPv6 called Connection Stability Aware PHMIPv6 (CSA-PHMIPv6). In CSA-PHMIPv6, mobile hosts select partners with whom communication can last for a sufficiently long time by employing the Link Expiration Time (LET) parameter. To tackle the security issues, the simple yet effective use of two distinct authentication keys is envisioned. Furthermore, to shorten the communication time between mobile hosts and their corresponding partners, a second handoff management approach called Partner Less Dependable PHMIPv6 (PLD-PHMIPv6) is proposed.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2010.04.090548","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/5441339/05441367.pdf","startPage":"1462","endPage":"1471","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2010.04.090548","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5441339","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A cooperative diversity based handoff management scheme","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5441367/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 April 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2010","displayDocTitle":"A cooperative diversity based handoff management scheme","volume":"9","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"April 2010","accessionNumber":"11208056","htmlLink":"/document/5441367/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"01 April 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A cooperative diversity based handoff management scheme","sourcePdf":"1462-tw1004-taleb.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.08929S","chronDate":"April  2010","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"5441339","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"26","xplore-issue":"5441339","articleId":"5441367","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5441368,"authors":[{"name":"Martin Wrulich","affiliation":["Institute of Communications and Radio Frequency Engineering, Vienna University of Technology, Austria"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/5441339/5441368/5441368-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Martin Wrulich was born in 1980 in Klagenfurt, Carinthia.

The intra-cell interference as a result of Transmit Antenna Array (TxAA) HSDPA multi-user transmissions, however, shows a special structure that can be exploited to allow for an efficient interference suppression. The contributions of this article are the following: we (a) propose a suitable system model to derive an intra-cell interference aware Minimum Mean Squared Error (MMSE) equalizer with moderate complexity and investigate its capabilities to suppress the multi-user intra-cell interference, (b) propose solutions to estimate the pre-coding state of the cell both with and without available training, and (c) investigate the resulting throughput performance with physical layer as well as system-level simulations. Our proposed solution can be interpreted as a multi-user extension of the classical MMSE equalizer for HSDPA systems without decoding the undesired users, resulting in only slightly increased complexity.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2010.04.090612","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/5441339/05441368.pdf","startPage":"1472","endPage":"1482","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2010.04.090612","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5441339","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Managing the interference structure of MIMO HSDPA: A multi-user interference aware MMSE receiver with moderate complexity","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5441368","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 April 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5441368/","displayDocTitle":"Managing the interference structure of MIMO HSDPA: A multi-user interference aware MMSE receiver with moderate complexity","volume":"9","issue":"4","publicationDate":"April 2010","accessionNumber":"11208057","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5441368/","dateOfInsertion":"01 April 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Managing the interference structure of MIMO HSDPA: A multi-user interference aware MMSE receiver with moderate complexity","sourcePdf":"1472-tw1004-wrulich.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.086118S","chronDate":"April  2010","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"5441339","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"5441339","articleId":"5441368","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":5441370,"authors":[{"name":"Yiyang Pei","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/5441339/5441370/5441370-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yiyang Pei (S'09) received her B.E. degree in electrical and electronic engineering from Nanyang Technological University (NTU), Singapore, in 2007.

Specially, we consider a secure multiple-input single-output (MISO) cognitive radio channel, where a multi-antenna SU transmitter (SU-Tx) sends confidential information to a legitimate SU receiver (SU-Rx) in the presence of an eavesdropper and on the licensed band of a primary user (PU). The secrecy capacity of the channel is characterized, which is a quasiconvex optimization problem of finding the capacity-achieving transmit covariance matrix under the joint transmit power and interference power constraints. Two numerical approaches are proposed to derive the optimal transmit covariance matrix. The first approach recasts the original quasiconvex problem into a single convex semidefinite program (SDP) by exploring its inherent convexity; while the second one explores the relationship between the secure CRN and the conventional CRN and transforms the original problem into a sequence of optimization problems associated with the conventional CRN, which helps to prove that beamforming is the optimal strategy for the secure MISO CR channel. In addition, to reduce the computational complexity, three suboptimal schemes are presented, namely, scaled secret beamforming (SSB), projected secret beamforming (PSB) and projected cognitive beamforming (PCB). Lastly, computer simulation results show that the three suboptimal schemes can approach the secrecy capacity well under certain conditions.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2010.04.090746","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/5441339/05441370.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5441339","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2010.04.090746","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","startPage":"1494","endPage":"1502","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Secure communication over MISO cognitive radio channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5441370","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 April 2010","displayDocTitle":"Secure communication over MISO cognitive radio channels","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5441370/","volume":"9","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/5441370/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2010","accessionNumber":"11208062","dateOfInsertion":"01 April 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Secure communication over MISO cognitive radio channels","sourcePdf":"1494-tw1004-pei.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.077888S","chronDate":"April  2010","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"5441339","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"161","xplore-issue":"5441339","articleId":"5441370","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5441371,"authors":[{"name":"Ying Jun Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering, Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/5441339/5441371/5441371-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Ying Jun (Angela) Zhang (S'00, M'05) received here PhD degree in Electrical and Electronic Engineering from the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong in 2004.

As is common with all random access protocols, the wireless channel is often under-utilized in MPR WLANs. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-round contention random-access protocol to address this problem. This work complements the existing randomaccess methods that are based on single-round contention. In the proposed scheme, stations are given multiple chances to contend for the channel until there are a sufficient number of \u00bfwinning\u00bf stations that can share the MPR channel for data packet transmission. The key issue here is the identification of the optimal time to stop the contention process and start data transmission. The solution corresponds to finding a desired tradeoff between channel utilization and contention overhead. In this paper, we conduct a rigorous analysis to characterize the optimal strategy using the theory of optimal stopping. An interesting result is that the optimal stopping strategy is a simple threshold-based rule, which stops the contention process as soon as the total number of winning stations exceeds a certain threshold. Compared with the conventional single-round contention protocol, the multi-round contention scheme significantly enhances channel utilization when the MPR capability of the channel is small to medium. Meanwhile, the scheme automatically falls back to single-round contention when the MPR capability is very large, in which case the throughput penalty due to random access is already small even with single-round contention.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multi-round contention in wireless LANs with multipacket reception","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2010.04.090841","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/5441339/05441371.pdf","startPage":"1503","endPage":"1513","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2010.04.090841","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5441339","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5441371","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5441371/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 April 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2010","displayDocTitle":"Multi-round contention in wireless LANs with multipacket reception","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"9","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/5441371/","dateOfInsertion":"01 April 2010","publicationDate":"April 2010","accessionNumber":"11208059","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multi-round contention in wireless LANs with multipacket reception","sourcePdf":"1503-tw1004-zhang.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.083479S","chronDate":"April  2010","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"5441339","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"36","xplore-issue":"5441339","articleId":"5441371","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5441372,"authors":[{"name":"Michele Morelli","affiliation":["Dipartimento Ingegneria dell'Informazione, Universita di Pisa, Pisa, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/5441339/5441372/5441372-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Michele Morelli received the Laurea (cum laude) in electrical engineering and the \u201cPremio di Laurea SIP\u201d from the University of Pisa, Italy, in 1991 and 1992 respectively.

As it is known, the exact maximum-likelihood (ML) solution to this problem involves a bidimensional grid-search that cannot be pursued in practice. After introducing an enlarged set of auxiliary unknown parameters, however, the RCFO and SFO recovery tasks can be decoupled and the bidimensional search is thus replaced with a simpler mono-dimensional search. This results into an estimation algorithm of reasonable complexity which is suitable for practical implementation. To further reduce the processing load, we also present an alternative scheme yielding frequency estimates in closed-form. Numerical simulations indicate that the proposed methods outperform existing estimators available in the literature in terms of both estimation accuracy and error-rate performance.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2010.04.091058","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/5441339/05441372.pdf","startPage":"1514","endPage":"1524","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2010.04.091058","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5441339","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fine carrier and sampling frequency synchronization in OFDM systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5441372","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 April 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5441372/","displayDocTitle":"Fine carrier and sampling frequency synchronization in OFDM systems","volume":"9","issue":"4","publicationDate":"April 2010","accessionNumber":"11208060","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5441372/","dateOfInsertion":"01 April 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fine carrier and sampling frequency synchronization in OFDM systems","sourcePdf":"1514-tw1004-morelli.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.084847S","chronDate":"April  2010","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"5441339","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"56","xplore-issue":"5441339","articleId":"5441372","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":5441373,"authors":[{"name":"Virag Shah","affiliation":["Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, India","Department of Electrical Eng, Indian Institute of Technology, Mumbai, India"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/5441339/5441373/5441373-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Virag Shah received his Bachelor of Engineering degree in Electronics from University of Mumbai, India in 2007.

While several criteria have been proposed for selecting one or more relays, distributed mechanisms that perform the selection have received relatively less attention. In this paper, we develop a novel, yet simple, asymptotic analysis of a splitting-based multiple access selection algorithm to find the single best relay. The analysis leads to simpler and alternate expressions for the average number of slots required to find the best user. By introducing a new `contention load\u00bf parameter, the analysis shows that the parameter settings used in the existing literature can be improved upon. New and simple bounds are also derived. Furthermore, we propose a new algorithm that addresses the general problem of selecting the best Q \u00bf 1 relays, and analyze and optimize it. Even for a large number of relays, the scalable algorithm selects the best two relays within 4.406 slots and the best three within 6.491 slots, on average. We also propose a new and simple scheme for the practically relevant case of discrete metrics. Altogether, our results develop a unifying perspective about the general problem of distributed selection in cooperative systems and several other multi-node systems.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2010.04.091364","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/5441339/05441373.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2010.04.091364","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5441339","startPage":"1525","endPage":"1535","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Splitting algorithms for fast relay selection: Generalizations, analysis, and a unified view","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5441373","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Splitting algorithms for fast relay selection: Generalizations, analysis, and a unified view","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5441373/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 April 2010","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"9","issue":"4","publicationDate":"April 2010","accessionNumber":"11208061","dateOfInsertion":"01 April 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5441373/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Splitting algorithms for fast relay selection: Generalizations, analysis, and a unified view","sourcePdf":"1525-tw1004-shah.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.079236S","chronDate":"April  2010","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"5441339","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"48","xplore-issue":"5441339","articleId":"5441373","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5441420,"authors":[{"name":"Glenn I.

consideration is a planar 2D array transducer working at 3.5 MHz. The transducer is composed of 17 by 17 piezoelectric elements separated by major and minor kerfs, a thick backing layer, two front impedance matching layers, and an acoustic lens. Three-dimensional finite element models of the transducer were constructed using the commercial finite element analysis (FEA) code PZFlex. The performance of an acoustic transducer is determined by the effects of many structural variables, and in most cases the influences of these variables are not linearly independent of each other. In this paper, through the FEA, the performance variation of the 2D array transducer was investigated by considering all the cross-coupled effects of its structural variables such as the thicknesses of the matching layers, and the width and depth of the major and minor kerfs. Based on the analysis, new structures of the 2D array were proposed to reduce the cross talk. Through statistical multiple regression analysis of the FEA results, the functional forms of the cross talk level, pulse-echo sensitivity, and acceptance angle of the 2D array were derived in terms of the structural variables of the new structures. Then, by applying the constrained optimization technique, genetic algorithm, to the derived functions, the optimal combination of the structural variables, i.e. optimal structure of the transducer, was determined to provide the lowest cross talk level and highest pulse-echo sensitivity while preserving a desired acceptance angle at the center frequency of 3.5 MHz.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ULTSYM.2009.5441507","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5441390","startPage":"2738","endPage":"2741","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Ultrasonics Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/5430769/5441390/05441507.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal design of a piezoelectric 2D array transducer to minimize the cross talk between active elements","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5441507/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-23 Sept. 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5441507/","displayDocTitle":"Optimal design of a piezoelectric 2D array transducer to minimize the cross talk between active elements","conferenceDate":"20-23 Sept. 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"11226445","dateOfInsertion":"01 April 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal design of a piezoelectric 2D array transducer to minimize the cross talk between active elements","confLoc":"Rome, Italy","sourcePdf":"IUS2009001373.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.03958S","chronDate":"20-23 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5430769","isNumber":"5441390","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5430769","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"5441390","articleId":"5441507","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5441513,"authors":[{"name":"St\u00e9phane Chamaly","affiliation":["EPCOS Private Limited, Singapore, Singapore"],"firstName":"St\u00e9phane","lastName":"Chamaly","id":"37397086800"},{"name":"Hoi Yan Fong","affiliation":["EPCOS Private Limited, Singapore, Singapore"],"lastName":"Hoi Yan Fong","id":"37409606800"},{"name":"Xavier Perois","affiliation":["EPCOS SAS, Sophia-Antipolis, France"],"firstName":"Xavier","lastName":"Perois","id":"37398847800"},{"name":"Markus Mayer","affiliation":["EPCOS AG, Munich, Germany"],"firstName":"Markus","lastName":"Mayer","id":"37302120300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4389-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4390-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1948-5727"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1051-0117"},{"format":"CD","value":"1948-5719"}],"articleNumber":"5441513","dbTime":"16 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":335},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["SAW filters","Lithium niobate","Bandwidth","Microwave filters","Ceramics","Wideband","Base stations","Surface acoustic wave devices","Radio frequency","Microwave communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["boundary-elements methods","finite element analysis","lithium compounds","piezoceramics","piezoelectric devices","radiofrequency filters","surface acoustic wave filters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["very low amplitude ripple SAW filter","infrastructure systems","Y-X lithium niobate","FEM-BEM design approach","high data rate communication devices","wide band filters","base stations","microwave radiolinks","SAW device design technique","piezoelectric device performance","electromechanical coupling coefficient","high reliability RF filters","GSM Rx filter","filter bandwidth","high reliability ceramic cavity package","frequency 1710 MHz to 1785 MHz","LiNbO3"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["component","SAW","infrastructure","lithium niobate","FEM/BEM"]}],"abstract":"High data rate communication devices demand high relative bandwidth and therefore wide band filters are necessary.

To obtain images with sufficient resolution, several thousand elements are required. To reduce the channel count from the transducer to the imaging system, it is necessary to include electronics close to the transducer and use smart signal processing for data reduction. A micro-beamforming method called pre-steering is proposed. All the groups have the same delay configuration, which will simplify the required electronics. For a correct design, delay steps and the maximum delay are of importance. Furthermore, the delay should be programmable for each direction. Simulations are performed to investigate the effect of pre-steering on the received field. The delay and sum operations are realized by an integrated circuit. Simulations show that, for the micro-beamformer of a matrix transducer, the pre-steering approach is an effective method to reduce the complexity of the electronics and the channel count, while maintaining an adequate receive field.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"20-23 Sept. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5441534/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"11226468","publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","conferenceDate":"20-23 Sept. 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5441534/","dateOfInsertion":"01 April 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Design of a micro-beamformer for a 2D piezoelectric ultrasound transducer","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design of a micro-beamformer for a 2D piezoelectric ultrasound transducer","confLoc":"Rome, Italy","sourcePdf":"IUS2009000559.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047687S","chronDate":"20-23 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5430769","isNumber":"5441390","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5430769","citationCount":"29","xplore-issue":"5441390","articleId":"5441534","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5441542,"authors":[{"name":"Ann E.A.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the performance of the APES beamformer on medical imaging data, since correct amplitude estimation often is just as important as spatial resolution. In our simulations we have used a 3.5 MHz, 96 element linear transducer array.

Currently fluoroscopy is the most common method for guiding interventional electrophysiological procedures. We are developing a 9-F forward-looking intracardiac ultrasound catheter for real-time volumetric imaging. We designed and fabricated a 64-element 10-MHz CMUT ring array with through-wafer via interconnects. We also designed custom front-end electronics to be closely integrated with the CMUT array at the tip of the catheter for improved SNR. This integrated circuit (IC) is composed of preamplifiers and protection circuitry, and can directly interface a standard imaging system. This multi-channel IC is capable of passing up to \u00b150-V bipolar pulses. An 8-channel front-end IC was fabricated based on this circuit topology. Additionally, a flexible PCB was designed for the integration of ring array with front-end electronics. We have acquired a PC-based real-time imaging platform and demonstrated real-time imaging with the ring array. We have also shown volume images using off-line full synthetic aperture image reconstruction method. The presented experimental results demonstrate the performance of our forward-looking volumetric intracardiac imaging approach. We are currently working on the final catheter integration and further development of our real-time imaging methods.","doi":"10.1109/ULTSYM.2009.5441600","startPage":"511","endPage":"514","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Ultrasonics Symposium","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ULTSYM.2009.5441600","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5441390","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Ultrasonics Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/5430769/5441390/05441600.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Forward-looking volumetric intracardiac imaging using a fully integrated CMUT ring array","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5441600/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Forward-looking volumetric intracardiac imaging using a fully integrated CMUT ring array","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5441600/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11221174","publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"01 April 2010","conferenceDate":"20-23 Sept. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-23 Sept. 2009","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Forward-looking volumetric intracardiac imaging using a fully integrated CMUT ring array","confLoc":"Rome, Italy","sourcePdf":"IUS2009001181.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061307S","chronDate":"20-23 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5430769","isNumber":"5441390","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5430769","citationCount":"29","xplore-issue":"5441390","articleId":"5441600","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-02"},{"_id":5441617,"authors":[{"name":"Brooks D.

Based on a statistical analysis of the instantaneous phase of the aperture data, a Phase Coherence Factor (PCF) is computed for every sampling instant. When used to weight the beamformer output, side and grating lobe levels are reduced and lateral resolution is increased. In this work, its application for grating lobe artifacts reduction is further investigated. Dependence of grating lobes reduction level with signal bandwidth and the number of array elements is analyzed and detection of low amplitude echoes located into the grating lobe region is addressed. Experimental data obtained with a 2-D matrix sparse array are presented. In a second experiment, a standard tissue-mimic phantom and a sparse linear array are used to evaluate the PCI grating lobe reduction performance for medical images.","doi":"10.1109/ULTSYM.2009.5441770","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Ultrasonics Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/5430769/5441390/05441770.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5441390","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ULTSYM.2009.5441770","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Ultrasonics Symposium","startPage":"341","endPage":"344","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Grating-lobes reduction by application of Phase Coherence Factors","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5441770","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-23 Sept. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Grating-lobes reduction by application of Phase Coherence Factors","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5441770/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5441770/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"11226386","dateOfInsertion":"01 April 2010","conferenceDate":"20-23 Sept. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Grating-lobes reduction by application of Phase Coherence Factors","confLoc":"Rome, Italy","sourcePdf":"IUS2009000776.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043766S","chronDate":"20-23 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5430769","isNumber":"5441390","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5430769","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"5441390","articleId":"5441770","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5441790,"authors":[{"name":"D.

Thus, the image generation can be divided into two stages: (1) the excitation and acquisition stage, where the signals received by each element or group of elements are stored; and (2) the beamforming stage, where the signals are combined together to obtain the image pixels. The use of Graphics Processing Units (GPUs), which are programmable devices with a high level of parallelism, can accelerate the computations of the beamforming process, that usually includes different functions such as dynamic focusing, band-pass filtering, spatial filtering or envelope detection. This work shows that using GPU technology can accelerate, in more than one order of magnitude with respect to CPU implementations, the beamforming and post-processing algorithms in SAFT imaging.","doi":"10.1109/ULTSYM.2009.5441790","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Ultrasonics Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/5430769/5441390/05441790.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5441390","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ULTSYM.2009.5441790","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Ultrasonics Symposium","startPage":"1334","endPage":"1337","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Using GPUs for beamforming acceleration on SAFT imaging","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5441790","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-23 Sept. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Using GPUs for beamforming acceleration on SAFT imaging","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5441790/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5441790/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"11226402","dateOfInsertion":"01 April 2010","conferenceDate":"20-23 Sept. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Using GPUs for beamforming acceleration on SAFT imaging","confLoc":"Rome, Italy","sourcePdf":"IUS2009000801.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054805S","chronDate":"20-23 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5430769","isNumber":"5441390","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5430769","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"5441390","articleId":"5441790","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5441801,"authors":[{"name":"Rob Adamson","affiliation":["School of Biomedical Engineering, Dalhousie University, Halifax, NS, Canada"],"firstName":"Rob","lastName":"Adamson","id":"37399547400"},{"name":"Zahra Torbatian","affiliation":["School of Biomedical Engineering, Dalhousie University, Halifax, NS, Canada"],"firstName":"Zahra","lastName":"Torbatian","id":"37399549700"},{"name":"Manohar Bance","affiliation":["School of Biomedical Engineering, Dalhousie University, Halifax, NS, Canada"],"firstName":"Manohar","lastName":"Bance","id":"37399542500"},{"name":"Jeremy Brown","affiliation":["School of Biomedical Engineering, Dalhousie University, Halifax, NS, Canada"],"firstName":"Jeremy","lastName":"Brown","id":"37276945100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4389-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4390-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1948-5727"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1051-0117"},{"format":"CD","value":"1948-5719"}],"articleNumber":"5441801","dbTime":"14 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":83},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Surface acoustic waves","Electrodes","Delay effects","Array signal processing","Ultrasonic imaging","Propagation delay","Delay lines","Ultrasonic transducers","Acoustic waves","Surface waves"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","lead compounds","surface acoustic wave delay lines","ultrasonic delay lines","ultrasonic transducer arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["high frequency beamformer design","variable PMN-PT SAW delay","ultrasound beamformer","surface acoustic wave delay line","SAW electrodes","elongation","compression","Pb(Mg0.33Nb0.67)O3-PbTiO3"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Surface Acousitc Wave (SAW)","Beamformer","High-frequency","Single Crystal ( PMN-PT)","Transducer Array"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5441801","doi":"10.1109/ULTSYM.2009.5441801","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Ultrasonics Symposium","abstract":"A high-frequency ultrasound beamformer based on 70Pb(Mg\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1/3</sub>\nNb\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2/3</sub>\n)O\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">3</sub>\n-0.30PbTiO\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">3</sub>\n (PMN-30%PT) single crystal has been designed.

tunable analog delay element for high-frequency dynamic beamforming","abstract":"Implementing beamforming for high frequency arrays is challenging because of the accurate delay requirements at high frequencies. High frequency digital beamforming is not suitable for catheter based applications as a large number of cables is required between the array and the external beamformer. A possible solution is to perform analog beamforming on an integrated circuit adjacent or monolithically integrated to the imaging array. In this study, we introduce an improved voltage in voltage out low pass filter as an analog delay cell for high frequency dynamic beamformers. This circuit can generate three times more delay with a given bandwidth when compared to conventional low pass filters. Delay of the circuit is tunable and the gain of the cell is inherently very close to unity. The proposed delay cell operates single ended and therefore is more suitable for CMUT operation which generates single ended output. We designed a test beamformer for a 30MHz, equal area, annular array with 100% bandwidth using the proposed delay cell and the unit-delay focusing architecture. Required delays are implemented using a delay line made up of improved delay elements with tunable delays. To demonstrate functionality we designed and fabricated a custom front-end IC in a 0.5\u00bfm standard CMOS process. The IC chip consists of 8 transimpedance amplifiers, voltage-to-current converters, the analog dynamic beamformer, and two buffers. We present results of preliminary imaging experiments that demonstrate the focusing capability.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"20-23 Sept. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5441823/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"11226489","publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","conferenceDate":"20-23 Sept. 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5441823/","dateOfInsertion":"01 April 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A tunable analog delay element for high-frequency dynamic beamforming","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A tunable analog delay element for high-frequency dynamic beamforming","confLoc":"Rome, Italy","sourcePdf":"IUS2009000967.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059715S","chronDate":"20-23 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5430769","isNumber":"5441390","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5430769","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"5441390","articleId":"5441823","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5441844,"authors":[{"name":"Sevan Harput","affiliation":["Ultrasound Group, School of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University of Leeds, UK"],"firstName":"Sevan","lastName":"Harput","id":"37399486300"},{"name":"David M.

For low frequencies the resolution is limited but changing to higher frequencies increases attenuation and decreases the penetration depth. The proposed solution in this paper is to use a long-duration, frequency modulated excitation signal in order to improve SNR and increase penetration depth. Although long-duration excitation provides a better penetration, the internal reflections inside the enamel and dentin layers make the received signal uninterpretable. The fractional Fourier transform (FrFT) allows frequency modulated signals overlapping in time and frequency to be separated. In this work, we present the application of the fractional Fourier technique to tooth imaging by analyzing and filtering chirp signals, overlapping in both the time and frequency domains, where the common time or frequency based filtering is not applicable. The intended application of the proposed technique is producing an image of tooth enamel and underlying dentino-enamel junction (DEJ).","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Ultrasonics Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/5430769/5441390/05441844.pdf","startPage":"1906","endPage":"1909","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Ultrasonics Symposium","doi":"10.1109/ULTSYM.2009.5441844","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ULTSYM.2009.5441844","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5441390","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5441844","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Tooth characterization using ultrasound with fractional Fourier transform","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Teeth","Ultrasonic imaging","Fourier transforms","Frequency modulation","Filtering","Signal resolution","Attenuation","Reflection","Chirp modulation","Image analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biomedical ultrasonics","chirp modulation","dentistry","Fourier transforms","medical signal processing","ultrasonic imaging"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["tooth characterization","ultrasound","fractional Fourier transform","internal tooth structure","nondestructive ultrasonic imaging","pulse-echo technique","frequency modulated excitation signal","penetration depth","enamel layer","dentin layer","FrFT","chirp signal filtering","dentino-enamel junction"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5441844/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-23 Sept. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Tooth characterization using ultrasound with fractional Fourier transform","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5441844/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"11226502","dateOfInsertion":"01 April 2010","conferenceDate":"20-23 Sept. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Tooth characterization using ultrasound with fractional Fourier transform","confLoc":"Rome, Italy","sourcePdf":"IUS2009000953.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049824S","chronDate":"20-23 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5430769","isNumber":"5441390","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5430769","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5441390","articleId":"5441844","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5441869,"authors":[{"name":"Ivan K.

Through such data access, we can obtain in-vitro or in-vivo insights on various imaging methods without resorting to hardware implementation. This paper reports the development of a pre-beamform data acquisition (DAQ) system that can collect data from 128 array elements in parallel. Our DAQ system is intended to interface with a Sonix-RP research scanner through a probe connector port. It comprises three major blocks: 1) a connector board that interfaces with the array probe and the scanner; 2) a main board that triggers data acquisition and controls data transfer to a computer; 3) four receiver boards that are each responsible for acquiring 32 channels of digitized raw data and storing them to the on-board DDR2 memory. The probe-connecting end of this system is interfaced with TX810 chips to facilitate switching between transmit and receive modes. When receiving data, the incoming analog signal is first passed into a low-noise amplifier. These signals are then sent into AD9272 chips on the four receiver boards to perform time gain compensation, anti-alias filtering, and 12-bit data sampling at an 80MHz rate. Subsequently, the digitized signal samples are de-serialized using a Virtex-5 FPGA and are stored into DDR2 memory. To facilitate data retrieval, we implemented a Virtex-5 FPGA on the main board to initiate data transfer, and if preferred, to perform on-board beamforming (programmable by user) prior to sending data to a computer through a USB 2.0 link. For our prototype, we used 16GB of DDR2 memory for data storage. With a frame rate of 35Hz, a 10cm depth-of-view and 128 transmit firings per frame, this DAQ system is capable of collecting pre-beamform data from all array channels for 2.5 seconds. We are currently completing the prototype development in collaboration with Ultrasonix.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"20-23 Sept. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5441869/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"11208580","publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","conferenceDate":"20-23 Sept. 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5441869/","dateOfInsertion":"01 April 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Design of a multi-channel pre-beamform data acquisition system for an ultrasound research scanner","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design of a multi-channel pre-beamform data acquisition system for an ultrasound research scanner","confLoc":"Rome, Italy","sourcePdf":"IUS2009000879.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059827S","chronDate":"20-23 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5430769","isNumber":"5441390","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5430769","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5441390","articleId":"5441869","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5441925,"authors":[{"name":"Guillaume Zahnd","affiliation":["CREATIS-LRMN ; CNRS UMR5220 ; INSERM U630, INSA-Lyon, Universit\u00e9 de Lyon, France"],"firstName":"Guillaume","lastName":"Zahnd","id":"37399012800"},{"name":"Adrian Basarab","affiliation":["CREATIS-LRMN ; CNRS UMR5220 ; INSERM U630, INSA-Lyon, Universit\u00e9 de Lyon, France"],"firstName":"Adrian","lastName":"Basarab","id":"37298011900"},{"name":"Herv\u00e9 Liebgott","affiliation":["CREATIS-LRMN ; CNRS UMR5220 ; INSERM U630, INSA-Lyon, Universit\u00e9 de Lyon, France"],"firstName":"Herv\u00e9","lastName":"Liebgott","id":"37298011200"},{"name":"Olivier Basset","affiliation":["CREATIS-LRMN ; CNRS UMR5220 ; INSERM U630, INSA-Lyon, Universit\u00e9 de Lyon, France"],"firstName":"Olivier","lastName":"Basset","id":"37297968000"},{"name":"Philippe Delachartre","affiliation":["CREATIS-LRMN ; CNRS UMR5220 ; INSERM U630, INSA-Lyon, Universit\u00e9 de Lyon, France"],"firstName":"Philippe","lastName":"Delachartre","id":"37297990700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4389-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4390-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1948-5727"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1051-0117"},{"format":"CD","value":"1948-5719"}],"articleNumber":"5441925","dbTime":"19 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":67},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Ultrasonic imaging","Array signal processing","Motion estimation","Radio frequency","Probes","Phase estimation","Libraries","Image analysis","Image motion analysis","Biomedical imaging"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["acoustic signal processing","array signal processing","motion estimation","ultrasonic imaging"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["realtime specific beamforming","motion trajectory estimation","ultrasound imaging","axial oscillation","lateral oscillation","phase images","2D spatial shift estimator"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Real-time specific beamforming applied to motion trajectory estimation in ultrasound imaging","doi":"10.1109/ULTSYM.2009.5441925","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5441390","endPage":"4","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Ultrasonics Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Ultrasonics Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/5430769/5441390/05441925.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ULTSYM.2009.5441925","startPage":"1","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5441925","abstract":"In this paper, a motion trajectory estimation method with specific ultrasound RF images is proposed.

Parallel receive beamforming is used to help overcome this problem, but this introduces artifacts in the images. In addition to the parallel beamforming artifacts found in B-mode imaging, we have found that a difference in curvature of transmit and receive beams gives a bias in the Doppler velocity estimates. This bias causes a discontinuity in the velocity estimates in color flow images. In this work we have shown that interpolation of the autocorrelation estimates obtained from overlapping receive-beams can reduce these artifacts significantly. Since the auto-correlation function varies quite slowly the beams can be acquired with a significant time difference, for instance across interleaving groups or across scan planes in a 3D scan. We have shown that a high frame rate of color flow images can be maintained with parallel beam acquisition with minimal deterioration of the image quality.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"20-23 Sept. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5441926/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"11221221","publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","conferenceDate":"20-23 Sept. 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5441926/","dateOfInsertion":"01 April 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Reducing color flow artifacts caused by parallel beamforming","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reducing color flow artifacts caused by parallel beamforming","confLoc":"Rome, Italy","sourcePdf":"IUS2009000375.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047945S","chronDate":"20-23 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5430769","isNumber":"5441390","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5430769","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5441390","articleId":"5441926","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5441943,"authors":[{"name":"Michael I.

The low component cost, compact form factor with integrated 2D transducer array, and an intuitive C-scan image format displayed directly over the anatomy of interest are what distinguish this device from conventional ultrasound systems. A prototype of the Sonic Window was designed and constructed consisting of a fully sampled 60 \u00d7 60 transducer array, custom integrated circuits (ICs) containing 3,600 front-end receive channels, a high-voltage transmit circuit, an off-the-shelf digital signal processor (DSP), and a liquid crystal display. The 2D transducer array was fabricated on one side of a 2-layer PCB and the front-end ICs were attached onto the other side using a flip-chip process. The front-end ICs acquire the data for one C-scan slice per transmit event and send digital data to the DSP, which uses the Direct-Sampled In-phase Quadrature (DSIQ) method for efficient beamforming. The prototype fits in a 6-cm \u00d7 15-cm \u00d7 3.5-cm enclosure containing a 1500 mAh rechargeable battery and weighs 6 oz. (170 g).

One of the proposed techniques to overcome this limitation is the Transverse Oscillation (TO) method, which also estimates the lateral velocity components. The performance of this is evaluated on a commercial platform. Beamformed data are acquired using a commercial BK Medical scanner as opposed to the previously reported results obtained with the experimental scanner RASMUS. The implementation is evaluated using an in-house circulating flow rig by calculating the relative mean standard deviation and bias of the velocity components. The relative mean standard deviation decreases as the number of shots per estimate increases and a value of 5% is obtained for 64 shots per estimate. For a center frequency of 5 MHz at 60\u00b0, 75\u00b0, and 90\u00b0, the relative mean bias varies from 21% to 27% and is lowest at a transmit focal depth close to the center of the vessel. The present performance is comparable with the results from the experimental scanner and simulations. It is obtained with only few changes to the conventional CFI setup and further optimization can improve the performance. This illustrates the feasibility of implementing the TO method on a commercial platform for real-time estimation.","doi":"10.1109/ULTSYM.2009.5441954","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Ultrasonics Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/5430769/5441390/05441954.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5441390","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ULTSYM.2009.5441954","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Ultrasonics Symposium","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance of the Transverse Oscillation method using beamformed data from a commercial scanner","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5441954","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-23 Sept. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Performance of the Transverse Oscillation method using beamformed data from a commercial scanner","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5441954/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5441954/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"11226518","dateOfInsertion":"01 April 2010","conferenceDate":"20-23 Sept. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance of the Transverse Oscillation method using beamformed data from a commercial scanner","confLoc":"Rome, Italy","sourcePdf":"IUS2009000348.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.075437S","chronDate":"20-23 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5430769","isNumber":"5441390","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5430769","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5441390","articleId":"5441954","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5441958,"authors":[{"name":"Reza Zahiri-Azar","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada"],"firstName":"Reza","lastName":"Zahiri-Azar","id":"38274384000"},{"name":"Orcun Goksel","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada"],"firstName":"Orcun","lastName":"Goksel","id":"37399110100"},{"name":"Septimiu E.

Therefore, its computational cost, accuracy, and precision are of significant importance. In this work, we consider the problem of 3D subsample motion estimation. Extending our previous 2D work, we define a 3D polynomial interpolation function that fits the discrete pattern matching coefficients obtained from digitized 3D echo data. A joint estimation of the axial, lateral and elevational motion is obtained by finding the extremum of this 3D polynomial fit. We study this method using a synthetic phantom and the Field II ultrasound simulation software. The mean absolute axial, lateral, and elevational biases of the proposed 3D polynomial fitting were found to be 0.0066, 0.0075, and 0.0047 of a sample (corresponding to 127 nm, 2.25 \u00bfm, and 710 nm), respectively, for an axial sampling of 40 MHz (\u00bf 19.3 \u00bfm), a lateral sampling of 300 \u00bfm, and an elevational sampling of 150 \u00bfm.

Solid-state SL-IVUS imaging probes use piezoelectric transducer arrays and electronic beam-forming. Synthetic phased array processing of signals detected with small-sized elements in these arrays limits the SNR achievable with these probes. In this study, we explore a new SL-IVUS probe architecture employing rotating phased annular CMUT arrays.

We also two fabricated sample annular array designs operating at 20-MHz and 50-MHz. Our experimental measurements on the 20-MHz array in oil shows 105% fractional bandwidth. The 50-MHz array with parylene coating shows approximately 40% fractional bandwidth measured in water.

The adaptive transmit apodization is obtained by applying MV across the full set of single emission images before summation. The method is investigated using simulated SA ultrasound data obtained using Field II. Data of 13 point targets distributed at depths from 40 mm to 70 mm, and a 5.5 MHz, 64-element linear array transducer have been used. The investigation has shown that the introduction of adaptive apodization weights on the transmitting aperture provides a main-lobe reduction (estimated at -30 dB) by a factor of 1.8 compared to the method using adaptive apodization weights on the receiving aperture only.","doi":"10.1109/ULTSYM.2009.5442035","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Ultrasonics Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/5430769/5441390/05442035.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5441390","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ULTSYM.2009.5442035","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Ultrasonics Symposium","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive receive and transmit apodization for synthetic aperture ultrasound imaging","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5442035","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-23 Sept. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive receive and transmit apodization for synthetic aperture ultrasound imaging","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5442035/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5442035/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"11226269","dateOfInsertion":"01 April 2010","conferenceDate":"20-23 Sept. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive receive and transmit apodization for synthetic aperture ultrasound imaging","confLoc":"Rome, Italy","sourcePdf":"IUS2009000187.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059875S","chronDate":"20-23 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5430769","isNumber":"5441390","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5430769","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"5441390","articleId":"5442035","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5442074,"authors":[{"name":"Robert Wodnicki","affiliation":["Research Circle, GE Global Research Center, Niskayuna, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Robert","lastName":"Wodnicki","id":"37297014300"},{"name":"Charles G.

around an object are incoherently superimposed to achieve a higher image quality. To apply FASC to breast imaging, we developed an add-on system to a conventional ultrasound echo scanner. With this system also the distribution of Speed of Sound (SoS) inside the breast can be reconstructed using a reflector behind the breast. Next to diagnostics, SoS-images are used to geometrically correct FASC-images and avoid artifacts. However, since attenuation in the breast and reflections at its boundary are high, the detection of the reflector and the SoS-reconstruction may fail. To still correct FASC-images, we developed an image based method to compute a mean SoS for the breast on the basis of a typical double-line artifact in the FASC-image.","doi":"10.1109/ULTSYM.2009.5442079","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Ultrasonics Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Ultrasonics Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/5430769/5441390/05442079.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ULTSYM.2009.5442079","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5441390","startPage":"538","endPage":"541","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Determination of a mean sound velocity in the female breast for artifact reduction in Full Angle Spatial Compounding","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5442079","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Determination of a mean sound velocity in the female breast for artifact reduction in Full Angle Spatial Compounding","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-23 Sept. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5442079/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"20-23 Sept. 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"11239824","dateOfInsertion":"01 April 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5442079/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Determination of a mean sound velocity in the female breast for artifact reduction in Full Angle Spatial Compounding","confLoc":"Rome, Italy","sourcePdf":"IUS2009000076.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054597S","chronDate":"20-23 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5430769","isNumber":"5441390","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5430769","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5441390","articleId":"5442079","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5442090,"authors":[{"name":"Toshio Ito","affiliation":["Graduate School of Engineering, University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Toshio","lastName":"Ito","id":"37401184300"},{"name":"Masanori Sugimoto","affiliation":["Graduate School of Engineering, University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Masanori","lastName":"Sugimoto","id":"37265657200"},{"name":"Hiromichi Hashizume","affiliation":["National Institute of Information, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Hiromichi","lastName":"Hashizume","id":"37283155600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4389-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4390-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1948-5727"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1051-0117"},{"format":"CD","value":"1948-5719"}],"articleNumber":"5442090","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":148},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Acoustic imaging","Genetic algorithms","Signal synthesis","Image quality","Image resolution","Signal resolution","High-resolution imaging","Pulse compression methods","Degradation","Optimization methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["acoustic imaging","acoustic signal processing","genetic algorithms","pulse compression"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["high resolution acoustic imaging","multicarrier waveform","genetic algorithm","image quality","pulse compression","synthetic transmit aperture","signal synthesis","correlation noise","M-sequence signal"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5442090","abstract":"We propose an acoustic imaging method that can achieve high resolution and high image quality. Our imaging method is based on a combination of pulse compression and the synthetic transmit aperture (STA). Conventionally, these methods have often used signals modulated with M-sequences because of their relatively good orthogonality. However, the image quality is degraded by noise in the correlations between such signals. Our proposed method addresses this issue by intentionally synthesizing signals with suppressed correlations. We devised a new method for signal synthesis, in which the sub-carrier parameters of multi-carrier signals were optimized by a genetic algorithm. The simulation results showed that the optimized signals reduced the correlation noise by 7.8 dB compared to the conventional M-sequence signals. The improvement in image quality was also verified by the simulation.","doi":"10.1109/ULTSYM.2009.5442090","startPage":"685","endPage":"689","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Ultrasonics Symposium","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ULTSYM.2009.5442090","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5441390","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Ultrasonics Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/5430769/5441390/05442090.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High-resolution acoustic imaging using multi-carrier waveforms synthesized by genetic algorithm","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5442090/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"High-resolution acoustic imaging using multi-carrier waveforms synthesized by genetic algorithm","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5442090/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11226552","publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"01 April 2010","conferenceDate":"20-23 Sept. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-23 Sept. 2009","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High-resolution acoustic imaging using multi-carrier waveforms synthesized by genetic algorithm","confLoc":"Rome, Italy","sourcePdf":"IUS2009000034.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.105451S","chronDate":"20-23 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5430769","isNumber":"5441390","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5430769","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5441390","articleId":"5442090","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5442440,"authors":[{"name":"Tingyi Liu","affiliation":["University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Tingyi","lastName":"Liu","id":"37407006600"},{"name":"Prosenjit Sen","affiliation":["University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Prosenjit","lastName":"Sen","id":"37401656700"},{"name":"Chang-Jin Kim","affiliation":["University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Chang-Jin","lastName":"Kim","id":"38184249000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5764-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5761-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5763-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1084-6999"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1084-6999"}],"articleNumber":"5442440","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":21,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":1740},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Surface tension","Oxidation","Glass","Gallium alloys","Micromechanical devices","Dielectric measurements","Nitrogen","Difference equations","Gravity","Bonding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["contact angle","eutectic alloys","gallium alloys","indium alloys","liquid metals","surface tension","tin alloys","wetting"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["droplet applications","mercury droplets","oxidation","nitrogen-filled glove box","liquid-air interface","surface tension","pendant drop method","contact angles","electrowetting","dielectric mechanism","liquid metal Galinstan","temperature 28 degC","SiO2","GaInSn"]}],"abstract":"We report our characterization of nontoxic liquid-metal alloy Galinstan\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">\u00ae</sup>\n on its potential for substituting mercury droplets in miniature devices.

Characterization studies show that TMMF lamination is ideally suited for the sealing of silicon microchannels showing numerous advantages over adhesive-based approaches, thermal and anodic bonding.","doi":"10.1109/MEMSYS.2010.5442480","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE 23rd International Conference on Micro Electro Mechanical Systems (MEMS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE 23rd International Conference on Micro Electro Mechanical Systems (MEMS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5438531/5442276/05442480.pdf","startPage":"400","endPage":"403","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MEMSYS.2010.5442480","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5442276","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hybrid fabrication of microfluidic chips based on COC, silicon and TMMF dry resist","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5442480","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 Jan. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5442480/","displayDocTitle":"Hybrid fabrication of microfluidic chips based on COC, silicon and TMMF dry resist","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2010","accessionNumber":"11229640","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5442480/","conferenceDate":"24-28 Jan. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"08 April 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hybrid fabrication of microfluidic chips based on COC, silicon and TMMF dry resist","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"032WP21.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057428S","chronDate":"24-28 Jan. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5438531","isNumber":"5442276","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5438531","xplore-issue":"5442276","articleId":"5442480","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5442509,"authors":[{"name":"E.

Unblocked vias are essential for creating 3D microfluidic networks. Previously reported methods either had low yield, because of residual membranes covering the vias after polymerization, or required complicated extra steps to remove the blocking membranes. In contrast, our method prevents the formation of residual membranes by inhibition of the polymerization on top of the protuding mold features defining the vias locations. In addition to providing unblocked vias, the inhibition also leaves a flat partially cured, sticky top surface that adheres well to other surfaces and allows self-sealing stacking of several PDMS layers. We demonstrate the new method by manufacturing a densely perforated PDMS membrane and a large scale integrated (LSI) 3D PDMS microfluidic channel network. Our method enables batch manufacturing of complex fluidic devices by speeding up and simplifying the fabrication of complex microfluidic components in standard PDMS.","doi":"10.1109/MEMSYS.2010.5442520","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE 23rd International Conference on Micro Electro Mechanical Systems (MEMS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE 23rd International Conference on Micro Electro Mechanical Systems (MEMS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5438531/5442276/05442520.pdf","startPage":"240","endPage":"243","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MEMSYS.2010.5442520","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5442276","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Large scale integrated 3D microfluidic networks through high yield fabrication of vertical vias in PDMS","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5442520","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 Jan. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5442520/","displayDocTitle":"Large scale integrated 3D microfluidic networks through high yield fabrication of vertical vias in PDMS","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2010","accessionNumber":"11241148","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5442520/","conferenceDate":"24-28 Jan. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"08 April 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Large scale integrated 3D microfluidic networks through high yield fabrication of vertical vias in PDMS","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"010A1.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053985S","chronDate":"24-28 Jan. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5438531","isNumber":"5442276","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5438531","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5442276","articleId":"5442520","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":5442522,"authors":[{"name":"Donovan Lee","affiliation":["University of California, Berkeley, USA"],"firstName":"Donovan","lastName":"Lee","id":"37406588700"},{"name":"Vincent Pott","affiliation":["University of California, Berkeley, USA"],"firstName":"Vincent","lastName":"Pott","id":"37283166800"},{"name":"Hei Kam","affiliation":["University of California, Berkeley, USA"],"firstName":"Hei","lastName":"Kam","id":"37397934800"},{"name":"Rhesa Nathanael","affiliation":["University of California, Berkeley, USA"],"firstName":"Rhesa","lastName":"Nathanael","id":"37394043800"},{"name":"Tsu-Jae King Liu","affiliation":["University of California, Berkeley, USA"],"firstName":"Tsu-Jae King","lastName":"Liu","id":"38184487300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5764-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5761-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5763-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1084-6999"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1084-6999"}],"articleNumber":"5442522","dbTime":"15 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":306},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Adhesives","Atomic force microscopy","Microrelays","Force measurement","Electrodes","Contacts","Coatings","Digital relays","Surface resistance","Surface treatment"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adhesion","atomic force microscopy","microrelays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["AFM characterization","microrelays","atomic force microscopy","contacting electrodes","contact force","surface adhesion force","energy efficiency","coating","TiO2"]}],"abstract":"Characterization of adhesion force using atomic force microscopy is adapted for micro-relay applications.

It is shown that the new experimental method can be used to predict the fatigue lifetime in a more efficient manner.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5442527/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-28 Jan. 2010","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"24-28 Jan. 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5442527/","dateOfInsertion":"08 April 2010","publicationDate":"Jan. 2010","accessionNumber":"11229652","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A novel fatigue test with ramping stress amplitude to evaluate fatigue behavior of polysilicon thin films","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A novel fatigue test with ramping stress amplitude to evaluate fatigue behavior of polysilicon thin films","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"009B1.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044639S","chronDate":"24-28 Jan. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5438531","isNumber":"5442276","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5438531","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5442276","articleId":"5442527","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5442531,"authors":[{"name":"Wen-Chien Chen","affiliation":["National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Wen-Chien","lastName":"Chen","id":"37404841200"},{"name":"Che-Sheng Chen","affiliation":["National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Che-Sheng","lastName":"Chen","id":"37406727700"},{"name":"Kuei-Ann Wen","affiliation":["National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Kuei-Ann","lastName":"Wen","id":"37271164900"},{"name":"Long-Sheng Fan","affiliation":["National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Long-Sheng","lastName":"Fan","id":"37401747200"},{"name":"Weileun Fang","affiliation":["National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Weileun","lastName":"Fang","id":"37289074100"},{"name":"Sheng-Shian Li","affiliation":["National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Sheng-Shian","lastName":"Li","id":"37279611300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5764-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5761-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5763-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1084-6999"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1084-6999"}],"articleNumber":"5442531","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":13,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":314},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Foundries","Micromechanical devices","Flexible printed circuits","Frequency","Boundary conditions","Application specific integrated circuits","Radiofrequency integrated circuits","Fabrication","Integrated circuit technology","Mechanical sensors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["amplifiers","CMOS integrated circuits","micromechanical resonators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["capacitively-transduced resonators","generalized foundry CMOS-MEMS platform","integrated micromechanical resonator circuits","design flexibilities","amplifier circuits","structural materials","mechanical boundary conditions","transduction area","IC fabrication technology","frequency 500 kHz to 14.5 MHz"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5442531","abstract":"A generalized foundry CMOS-MEMS platform suited for integrated micromechanical resonator circuits have been developed for commercial multi-user purpose and demonstrated with a fast turnaround time and a variety of design flexibilities for resonator applications.

The proposed protection and control scheme consider both grid connected and autonomous operation of the microgrid. A protection scheme, capable of detecting faults effectively in both grid connected and islanded operations is proposed. The main challenge of the protection, due to current limiting state of the converters is overcome by using admittance relays. The relays operate according to the inverse time characteristic based on measured admittance of the line. The proposed scheme isolates the fault from both sides, while downstream side of the microgrid operates in islanding condition. Moreover faults can be detected in autonomous operation. In grid connected mode distributed generators (DG) supply the rated power while in absence of the grid, DGs share the entire power requirement proportional to rating based on output voltage angle droop control. The protection scheme ensures minimum load shedding with isolating the faulted network and DG control provides a smooth islanding and resynchronization operation. The efficacy of coordinated control and protection scheme has been validated through simulation for various operating conditions.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5442654/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-29 Dec. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","accessionNumber":"11227096","htmlLink":"/document/5442654/","dateOfInsertion":"05 April 2010","conferenceDate":"27-29 Dec. 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Control and protection of a microgrid with converter interfaced micro sources","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Control and protection of a microgrid with converter interfaced micro sources","confLoc":"Kharagpur, India","sourcePdf":"81.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050662S","chronDate":"27-29 Dec. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5436187","isNumber":"5442647","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5436187","citationCount":"54","xplore-issue":"5442647","articleId":"5442654","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5442670,"authors":[{"name":"Tapan Santra","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, College of Engineering and Management, Kolaghat, India"],"firstName":"Tapan","lastName":"Santra","id":"37396690100"},{"name":"A.K.

Once the system expanded, system fault level increases. Under this increased fault level, existing switchgear becomes under rated and needs to be replaced by a new one, which incurred a huge amount of investment. Naturally the cost of power at consumer premises increases. In this paper a novel approach to limit the system fault current by using a passive magnetic fault current limiter has been discussed. This device helps to expand the system with existing switchgear and saves a lot of money to provide quality power at affordable price.","doi":"10.1109/ICPWS.2009.5442670","publicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Power Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Power Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5436187/5442647/05442670.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICPWS.2009.5442670","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5442647","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis of passive magnetic fault current limiter using wavelet transform","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5442670","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-29 Dec. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5442670/","displayDocTitle":"Analysis of passive magnetic fault current limiter using wavelet transform","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","accessionNumber":"11227112","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5442670/","conferenceDate":"27-29 Dec. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"05 April 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis of passive magnetic fault current limiter using wavelet transform","confLoc":"Kharagpur, India","sourcePdf":"42.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05931S","chronDate":"27-29 Dec. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5436187","isNumber":"5442647","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5436187","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5442647","articleId":"5442670","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5442673,"authors":[{"name":"Anamika Jain","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, NIT Raipur (C.G.), Raipur, Chhattisgarh, India"],"firstName":"Anamika","lastName":"Jain","id":"37405404000"},{"name":"A.S.

This paper provides a systematic approach for designing a Supplementary Excitation Controller to damp the Low frequency oscillations observed in the system using an Innovative Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) Algorithm. In Power systems, a good measure of damping is the Damping Ratio. The proposed Controller design is formulated as a Damping ratio enhancement based Optimization problem to compute the Optimal damping controller parameters, which aid in improving system stability. To validate the effective damping action of the proposed controller, Non linear Time domain simulations has been carried out in this work. The contrasting feature of this work is the implementation of Dynamic Sensitivity Analysis. A detailed Sensitivity analysis reveals that the system dynamic performance with the proposed PSO based controller is quite robust to wide variations in system loading conditions and also variation in System model parameters compared to the conventionally designed Lead lag Controller.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Control systems","Algorithm design and analysis","Damping","Particle swarm optimization","Power system interconnection","Frequency","Power system measurements","Power system stability","Optimal control","Sensitivity analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["control system synthesis","damping","oscillations","particle swarm optimisation","power system control","power system interconnection","power system stability","sensitivity analysis","time-domain analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["supplementary excitation controller design","system damping ratio enhancement","innovative swarm intelligence algorithm","interconnected power systems","low-frequency inertial oscillations","power system disturbance","innovative particle swarm optimization algorithm","innovative PSO algorithm","optimal damping controller parameters","system stability","nonlinear time domain simulations","dynamic sensitivity analysis","lead lag controller"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Power System Stability","Damping ratio","Low frequency oscillations","Sensitivity Analysis"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICPWS.2009.5442710","publicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Power Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Power Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5436187/5442647/05442710.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5442647","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICPWS.2009.5442710","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Supplementary Excitation Controller design to enhance system Damping Ratio using an innovative swarm intelligence algorithm","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5442710","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Supplementary Excitation Controller design to enhance system Damping Ratio using an innovative swarm intelligence algorithm","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5442710/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5442710/","accessionNumber":"11227153","conferenceDate":"27-29 Dec. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"05 April 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-29 Dec. 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Supplementary Excitation Controller design to enhance system Damping Ratio using an innovative swarm intelligence algorithm","confLoc":"Kharagpur, India","sourcePdf":"265.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062023S","chronDate":"27-29 Dec. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5436187","isNumber":"5442647","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5436187","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5442647","articleId":"5442710","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5442716,"authors":[{"name":"Prashant P.

The OC relays are the major protection devices in a distribution system. OC relay is usually employed as backup protection. But in some situations it may be the only protection provided. To reduce the power outages, mal-operation of the backup relays should be avoided, and therefore, OC relay coordination in power distribution network is a major concern of protection engineer. The OC relay coordination in ring fed distribution networks is a highly constrained optimization problem. The purpose is to find an optimum relay setting to minimize the time of operation of relays and at the same time, to avoid the mal-operation of relays. This paper presents GA technique for optimum coordination of OC relays in a ring fed distribution system. Constraints are incorporated in the fitness function making use of the penalty method. Computer programs (using MATLAB) have been developed for optimum coordination of OC relays using GA technique.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Power Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5436187/5442647/05442716.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","publicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Power Systems","doi":"10.1109/ICPWS.2009.5442716","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICPWS.2009.5442716","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5442647","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5442716","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimum coordination of overcurrent relays in distribution system using genetic algorithm","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Relays","Genetic algorithms","Protective relaying","Power system protection","Power system relaying","Constraint optimization","Power system faults","Fault currents","Iterative closest point algorithm","Strontium"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithms","overcurrent protection","power distribution faults","power distribution protection","relay protection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["overcurrent relay coordination","genetic algorithm method","protection devices","power outages","backup relays mal-operation","power distribution network","protection engineer","ring fed distribution networks","optimum relay","fitness function","computer programs"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Overcurrent relay coordination","Constrained optimization","Genetic algorithms"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5442716/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-29 Dec. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Optimum coordination of overcurrent relays in distribution system using genetic algorithm","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5442716/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","accessionNumber":"11227159","dateOfInsertion":"05 April 2010","conferenceDate":"27-29 Dec. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimum coordination of overcurrent relays in distribution system using genetic algorithm","confLoc":"Kharagpur, India","sourcePdf":"247.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073523S","chronDate":"27-29 Dec. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5436187","isNumber":"5442647","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5436187","citationCount":"41","xplore-issue":"5442647","articleId":"5442716","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5442732,"authors":[{"name":"S.V.

Traditionally, power system stabilizers (PSS) are being used to damp these oscillations. Thyristor controlled series compensator (TCSC) is a well-known FACTS device that can control power flow in transmission lines. It can also replace PSS to damp low frequency oscillations effectively by cancelling a portion of the reactance line impedance and thereby increase the transmittable power. In this paper a linearized Heffron-Philips model of a (single machine infinite bus) power system with a TCSC controller is developed. The designed fuzzy c-means clustering TCSC controller adjusts control signal by appropriately processing of the input signals, and provides an efficient damping. The results of the simulation show that the TCSC with fuzzy c-means clustering controller is more effective in damping LFO compared to TCSC with lead-lag compensator.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5442647","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICPWS.2009.5442732","publicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Power Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Power Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5436187/5442647/05442732.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doi":"10.1109/ICPWS.2009.5442732","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fuzzy c-means clustering damping controller design for a power system installed with TCSC","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-29 Dec. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Fuzzy c-means clustering damping controller design for a power system installed with TCSC","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"27-29 Dec. 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5442732/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","accessionNumber":"11227175","dateOfInsertion":"05 April 2010","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5442732/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fuzzy c-means clustering damping controller design for a power system installed with TCSC","confLoc":"Kharagpur, India","sourcePdf":"208.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06206S","chronDate":"27-29 Dec. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5436187","isNumber":"5442647","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5436187","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5442647","articleId":"5442732","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5442734,"authors":[{"name":"Bibhu Prasad Padhy","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, Indian Institute of Technology, Roorkee, India"],"firstName":"Bibhu Prasad","lastName":"Padhy","id":"37396076900"},{"name":"Barjeev Tyagi","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, Indian Institute of Technology, Roorkee, India"],"firstName":"Barjeev","lastName":"Tyagi","id":"37397631400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4330-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4331-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5442734","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":426},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5442734","abstract":"This paper presents an artificial neural network (ANN) based controller for multi-area Automatic Generation Control (AGC) scheme in a deregulated electricity market.

Accurate faulted phase selection is required for such a scheme. This paper presents a novel scheme for detection and classification of faults on double circuit transmission line. The proposed approach uses combination of wavelet transform and neural network, to solve the problem. While wavelet transform is a powerful mathematical tool which can be employed as a fast and very effective means of analyzing power system transient signals, artificial neural network has a ability to classify non-linear relationship between measured signals by identifying different patterns of the associated signals. The proposed algorithm consists of time-frequency analysis of fault generated transients using wavelet transform, followed by pattern recognition using artificial neural network to identify the faulted phase. MATLAB/Simulink software is used to generate fault signals and verify the correctness of the algorithm. The adaptive discrimination scheme is tested by simulating different types of fault and varying fault resistance, fault location and fault inception time, on a given power system model. The simulation results show that the proposed phase selector scheme is able to identify faulted phase on the double circuit transmission line rapidly and correctly.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Faulted phase selection on double circuit transmission line using wavelet transform and neural network","publicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Power Systems","doi":"10.1109/ICPWS.2009.5442736","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Power Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5436187/5442647/05442736.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICPWS.2009.5442736","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5442647","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5442736","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5442736/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-29 Dec. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Faulted phase selection on double circuit transmission line using wavelet transform and neural network","conferenceDate":"27-29 Dec. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5442736/","dateOfInsertion":"05 April 2010","publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","accessionNumber":"11227179","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Faulted phase selection on double circuit transmission line using wavelet transform and neural network","confLoc":"Kharagpur, India","sourcePdf":"195.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066708S","chronDate":"27-29 Dec. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5436187","isNumber":"5442647","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5436187","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"5442647","articleId":"5442736","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5442744,"authors":[{"name":"N.M.

This approach based on the wave-shape recognition technique. An algorithm based on Neural Network Principal Component Analysis (NNPCA) with back propagation learning is proposed for digital differential protection of power transformer. The principal component analysis is used to preprocess the data from power system in order to eliminate redundant information and enhance hidden pattern of differential current to discriminate between internal faults from inrush and over-excitation conditions. This algorithm has been developed by considering optimal number of neurons in hidden layer and optimal number of neurons at output layer. The effect of hidden layer neurons on the classification accuracy is analyzed. The proposed algorithm makes use of ratio of voltage-to-frequency and amplitude of differential current for transformer operating condition detection.

This paper proposes a method for obtaining a fault tolerant implementation of BBNNs by using a biologically inspired layered design. At the lowest level, each block has its own online detection and correcting logic combined with sufficient spare components to ensure recovery from permanent and transient errors. Another layer of hierarchy combines the blocks into clusters, where a redundant column of blocks can be used to replace blocks that cannot be repaired at the lowest level. The hierarchical approach is well-suited to a divide-and-conquer approach to genetic programming whereby complex problems are subdivided into smaller parts. The overall approach can be implemented on a reconfigurable fabric.","doi":"10.1109/SSST.2010.5442804","startPage":"357","endPage":"361","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 42nd Southeastern Symposium on System Theory (SSST)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5439160/5442787/05442804.pdf","publicationTitle":"2010 42nd Southeastern Symposium on System Theory (SSST)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SSST.2010.5442804","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5442787","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fault tolerant Block Based Neural Networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fault tolerance","Neural networks","Fabrics","Integrated circuit interconnections","Circuit faults","Fault tolerant systems","Neural network hardware","Fault detection","Network topology","Logic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fault tolerant computing","genetic algorithms","neural nets","reconfigurable architectures"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fault tolerant block based neural networks","evolvable hardware","reconfigurable fabrics","massive parallelism","online detection","correcting logic","transient errors","divide-and-conquer approach","genetic programming"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Reconfigurable logic","Block based network","Fault detection and correction"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5442804/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-9 March 2010","displayDocTitle":"Fault tolerant Block Based Neural Networks","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5442804/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2010","dateOfInsertion":"05 April 2010","conferenceDate":"7-9 March 2010","accessionNumber":"11227031","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fault tolerant Block Based Neural Networks","confLoc":"Tyler, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"T2B4.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.076669S","chronDate":"7-9 March 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5439160","isNumber":"5442787","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5439160","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5442787","articleId":"5442804","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5442875,"authors":[{"name":"Andrey V.

One such noninvasive modality for cardiac motion tracking is ultrasound. Three-dimensional ultrasound motion tracking has been demonstrated using detected data at low volume rates. However, the effects of volume rate, kernel size, and data type (raw and detected) have not been sufficiently explored. First comparisons are made within the stated variables for 3-D speckle tracking. Volumetric data were obtained in a raw, baseband format using a matrix array attached to a high parallel receive beam count scanner. The scanner was used to acquire phantom and human in vivo cardiac volumetric data at 1000-Hz volume rates. Motion was tracked using phase-sensitive normalized cross-correlation. Subsample estimation in the lateral and elevational dimensions used the grid-slopes algorithm. The effects of frame rate, kernel size, and data type on 3-D tracking are shown. In general, the results show improvement of motion estimates at volume rates up to 200 Hz, above which they become stable. However, peak and pixel hopping continue to decrease at volume rates higher than 200 Hz. The tracking method and data show, qualitatively, good temporal and spatial stability (for independent kernels) at high volume rates.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TUFFC.2010.1489","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5442864","startPage":"839","endPage":"854","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","pdfPath":"/iel5/58/5442864/05442879.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"3-D phantom and in vivo cardiac speckle tracking using a matrix array and raw echo data","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5442879/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 April 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5442879/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"3-D phantom and in vivo cardiac speckle tracking using a matrix array and raw echo data","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2010","accessionNumber":"11228305","pubMedId":"20378447","dateOfInsertion":"08 April 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"57","issue":"4","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"3-D phantom and in vivo cardiac speckle tracking using a matrix array and raw echo data","sourcePdf":"t1040839.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.154184S","chronDate":"April  2010","xplore-pub-id":"58","isNumber":"5442864","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"58","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"5442864","articleId":"5442879","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5442950,"authors":[{"name":"Haleh Karkhaneh","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Amirkabir University of Technology\uc2a0, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Haleh","lastName":"Karkhaneh","id":"37397769500"},{"name":"Ayaz Ghorbani","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Amirkabir University of Technology\uc2a0, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Ayaz","lastName":"Ghorbani","id":"37286257400"},{"name":"Behrouz Zolfaghari","affiliation":["Department of Computer Engineering and Information Technology, Amirkabir University of Technology\uc2a0, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Behrouz","lastName":"Zolfaghari","id":"37268578600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5186-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-5187-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5442950","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":141},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["High power amplifiers","Decision support systems","Virtual reality"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["OFDM modulation","power amplifiers","radiocommunication","stochastic processes","wideband amplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["high power amplifier","memory effect","Wiener model","OFDM","adaptive predistorter"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["memory effects","behavioral modeling","wiener model","hammerstein model","predistortion"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5442950","doi":"10.1109/SCORED.2009.5442950","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SCORED.2009.5442950","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5442929","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Student Conference on Research and Development (SCOReD)","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Student Conference on Research and Development (SCOReD)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5439371/5442929/05442950.pdf","startPage":"505","endPage":"508","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improved modeling and compensating High Power Amplifier with memory effect","abstract":"This paper represents a new modified algorithm for modeling High Power Amplifier (HPA) based on wiener model for wideband applications such as OFDM.

The controller in use currently implemented a PID algorithm to control the position of the shockwave within the separator. This shockwave is essential for the separation process. However, a PID control paradigm is quite inefficient due to the non-linear properties of pressure distribution along the shockwave and the behavior of a shockwave that fluctuates generally around 500 Hz. Implementation of a Neural Network based controller on the system may yield better results in terms of controllability and stability as shown by some research due to its predictive and adaptive characteristic.","doi":"10.1109/SCORED.2009.5442971","startPage":"457","endPage":"460","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Student Conference on Research and Development (SCOReD)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SCORED.2009.5442971","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5442929","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Student Conference on Research and Development (SCOReD)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5439371/5442929/05442971.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Neural network controller implementation on a supersonic separator","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5442971/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Neural network controller implementation on a supersonic separator","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5442971/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11227005","publicationDate":"Nov. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"05 April 2010","conferenceDate":"16-18 Nov. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-18 Nov. 2009","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Neural network controller implementation on a supersonic separator","confLoc":"Serdang, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"117.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060343S","chronDate":"16-18 Nov. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5439371","isNumber":"5442929","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5439371","xplore-issue":"5442929","articleId":"5442971","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5443066,"authors":[{"name":"Amad-ud-Din","affiliation":["Electrical & Electronics Engineering Department, Faculty of Engineering, University Putra Malaysia, 43400 UPM, Serdang, Malaysia"],"lastName":"Amad-ud-Din"},{"name":"Izhal Abdul Halin","affiliation":["Electrical & Electronics Engineering Department, Faculty of Engineering, Universiti Putra Malaysia, Serdang, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Izhal Abdul","lastName":"Halin","id":"37400729900"},{"name":"Suhaidi B.

Anomaly systems detect intrusions by searching for an abnormal system activity. But the main problem of anomaly detection IDS is that; it is very difficult to build, because of the difficulty in defining what is normal and what is abnormal.

This system consists of a lightweight and power-saving wireless ECG device equipped with a built-in automatic warning expert system. This device is connected to a mobile and ubiquitous real-time display platform. The acquired ECG signals are instantaneously transmitted to mobile devices, such as netbooks or mobile phones through Bluetooth, and then, processed by the expert system. An alert signal is sent to the remote database server, which can be accessed by an Internet browser, once an abnormal ECG is detected. The current version of the expert system can identify five types of abnormal cardiac rhythms in real-time, including sinus tachycardia, sinus bradycardia, wide QRS complex, atrial fibrillation (AF), and cardiac asystole, which is very important for both the subjects who are being monitored and the healthcare personnel tracking cardiac-rhythm disorders. The proposed system also activates an emergency medical alarm system when problems occur. Clinical testing reveals that the proposed system is approximately 94% accurate, with high sensitivity, specificity, and positive prediction rates for ten normal subjects and 20 AF patients. We believe that in the future a business-card-like ECG device, accompanied with a mobile phone, can make universal cardiac protection service possible.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 April 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5443463/","volume":"14","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/5443463/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11328263","isJournal":true,"pubMedId":"20371411","publicationDate":"May 2010","dateOfInsertion":"01 June 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"An Intelligent Telecardiology System Using a Wearable and Wireless ECG to Detect Atrial Fibrillation","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Intelligent Telecardiology System Using a Wearable and Wireless ECG to Detect Atrial Fibrillation","sourcePdf":"titb-ko-2047401.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.089201S","chronDate":"May  2010","xplore-pub-id":"4233","isNumber":"5475408","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4233","citationCount":"106","xplore-issue":"5475408","articleId":"5443463","onlineDate":"05 April 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5443466,"authors":[{"name":"Cagdas Denizel Onal","affiliation":["Computer Science are Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7729/5764947/5443466/5443466-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Cagdas Denizel Onal (S\u201906\u2013M\u201910) received the B.

Robust particle-center and contact-loss detection algorithms are developed using force feedback to improve speed and reliability issues of AFM-based nanomanipulation. Unlike blind manipulation techniques, contact-loss detection enables better control over the success of manipulation. For pattern formation and assembly operations, a fully automated multiple-particle-manipulation method is developed, based on a commanding task planner. The task planner minimizes the obstacles to manipulation trajectories for better efficiency. Forces during AFM tip-particle-substrate contact are analyzed theoretically to determine the mode of manipulation as well as the effect of cantilever normal stiffness. The developed system is used to form patterns and assemblies of 100-nm-diameter gold nanoparticles on a flat substrate.","doi":"10.1109/TNANO.2010.2047510","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nanotechnology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nanotechnology","pdfPath":"/iel5/7729/5764947/05443466.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNANO.2010.2047510","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5764947","startPage":"472","endPage":"481","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Automated 2-D Nanoparticle Manipulation Using Atomic Force Microscopy","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5443466","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Automated 2-D Nanoparticle Manipulation Using Atomic Force Microscopy","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5443466/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 April 2010","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"10","issue":"3","publicationDate":"May 2011","accessionNumber":"11988327","dateOfInsertion":"10 May 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5443466/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Automated 2-D Nanoparticle Manipulation Using Atomic Force Microscopy","sourcePdf":"tnano-onal-2047510-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.108637S","chronDate":"May  2011","xplore-pub-id":"7729","isNumber":"5764947","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7729","citationCount":"40","xplore-issue":"5764947","articleId":"5443466","onlineDate":"05 April 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5443472,"authors":[{"name":"Zhili Lin","affiliation":["Department of Electro-Optical Engineering, School of Instrumentation Science and Optoelectronics Engineering, Beihang University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Zhili","lastName":"Lin","id":"37403764500"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1531-1309"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-1764"}],"articleNumber":"5443472","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":313},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society","url":"http://www.mtt.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Finite difference methods","Time domain analysis","Biological tissues","Biological system modeling","Permittivity","Frequency","Fitting","Taylor series","Humans"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bioelectric phenomena","biological tissues","finite difference time-domain analysis","permittivity"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fractional-ordered Cole-Cole models","numerical permittivities","biological tissues","second-order accurate FDTD algorithm","fourth-order accurate FDTD algorithm","one-dimension FDTD problem","human biological medium"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Biological tissue","Cole\u2013Cole Model","finite-difference time-domain (FDTD)"]}],"abstract":"The rationale behind several previously reported FDTD formulations for directly implementing fractional-ordered Cole-Cole models is investigated from another perspective.

To enable driver-assistance systems to address these problems, we require new sensing approaches to infer a driver's focus of attention. In this paper, we present a new procedure for static head-pose estimation and a new algorithm for visual 3-D tracking. They are integrated into the novel real-time (30 fps) system for measuring the position and orientation of a driver's head. This system consists of three interconnected modules that detect the driver's head, provide initial estimates of the head's pose, and continuously track its position and orientation in six degrees of freedom. The head-detection module consists of an array of Haar-wavelet Adaboost cascades. The initial pose estimation module employs localized gradient orientation (LGO) histograms as input to support vector regressors (SVRs). The tracking module provides a fine estimate of the 3-D motion of the head using a new appearance-based particle filter for 3-D model tracking in an augmented reality environment. We describe our implementation that utilizes OpenGL-optimized graphics hardware to efficiently compute particle samples in real time. To demonstrate the suitability of this system for real driving situations, we provide a comprehensive evaluation with drivers of varying ages, race, and sex spanning daytime and nighttime conditions. To quantitatively measure the accuracy of system, we compare its estimation results to a marker-based cinematic motion-capture system installed in the automotive testbed.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/6979/5475419/05443483.pdf","startPage":"300","endPage":"311","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems","doi":"10.1109/TITS.2010.2044241","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TITS.2010.2044241","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5475419","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5443483","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Head Pose Estimation and Augmented Reality Tracking: An Integrated System and Evaluation for Monitoring Driver Awareness","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Augmented reality","Monitoring","Automotive engineering","Particle tracking","Motion estimation","Real time systems","Position measurement","Histograms","Particle filters","Graphics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["augmented reality","motion estimation","pose estimation","road safety","support vector machines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["head pose estimation","augmented reality tracking","driver awareness monitoring","visual 3-D tracking","Haar-wavelet Adaboost cascades","gradient orientation histograms","support vector regressors","OpenGL-optimized graphics hardware","3-D face models"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Active safety","graphics programming units","head pose estimation","human-computer interface","intelligent driver assistance","performance metrics and evaluation","real-time machine vision","support vector classifiers","3-D face models and tracking"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5443483/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 April 2010","displayDocTitle":"Head Pose Estimation and Augmented Reality Tracking: An Integrated System and Evaluation for Monitoring Driver Awareness","volume":"11","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/5443483/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2010","accessionNumber":"11328292","dateOfInsertion":"01 June 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Head Pose Estimation and Augmented Reality Tracking: An Integrated System and Evaluation for Monitoring Driver Awareness","sourcePdf":"tits-murphychutorian-2044241.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.091552S","chronDate":"June  2010","xplore-pub-id":"6979","isNumber":"5475419","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6979","citationCount":"158","xplore-issue":"5475419","articleId":"5443483","onlineDate":"05 April 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-31"},{"_id":5443484,"authors":[{"name":"Mohamed Zakaria Kamh","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Toronto, Toronto, ONT, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/61/5570058/5443484/5443484-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Mohamed Zakaria Kamh (GSM'08) received the B.Sc.

The technique of elastography has evolved to image such properties. The clinical evidence gathered during studies involving elastography to identify cancerous lesions is very promising. However, the quantification of the resolution and specificity of elastography is best achieved under a controlled study using tissue-mimicking phantoms. One challenge is to reproduce viscoelastic behavior in phantoms as observed in biological tissues. In this paper, polyacrylamide gel based tissue-mimicking phantoms have been developed to experimentally study the role of viscoelastic properties in a controlled manner. To measure the Young's modulus, the phantoms were subjected to linear loading, and the stress-strain relationship is deduced therefrom. It is seen that the phantoms show hysteresis behavior. The viscoelastic properties of these phantoms were measured by subjecting the samples to cyclic loading. Normal forces during this process of loading were also measured as a measure of sample elasticity. To emulate the normal and pathological lesions, samples were prepared with varying concentration of monomer and studied. Three models, namely, Maxwell, Kelvin-Voigt (KV), and Kelvin-Voigt fractional derivative (KVFD), were chosen to fit the experimental data. Of these, the KVFD model was found to be best fitting for the experimental data obtained. Results indicate that stiffer samples exhibit large variations in the storage modulus when the precompression levels are altered.","doi":"10.1109/TIM.2009.2038002","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement","pdfPath":"/iel5/19/5443470/05443485.pdf","startPage":"1224","endPage":"1232","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5443470","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIM.2009.2038002","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5443485","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 April 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5443485/","displayDocTitle":"Measurement of Viscoelastic Properties of Polyacrylamide-Based Tissue-Mimicking Phantoms for Ultrasound Elastography Applications","volume":"59","issue":"5","publicationDate":"May 2010","accessionNumber":"11208268","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5443485/","dateOfInsertion":"05 April 2010","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Measurement of Viscoelastic Properties of Polyacrylamide-Based Tissue-Mimicking Phantoms for Ultrasound Elastography Applications","sourcePdf":"tim-jayashankar-2038002.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.088137S","chronDate":"May  2010","xplore-pub-id":"19","isNumber":"5443470","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"19","citationCount":"25","xplore-issue":"5443470","articleId":"5443485","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":5443491,"authors":[{"name":"Slobodan Babic","affiliation":["\u00c9cole Polytechnique de Montreal, Montreal, QUE, Canada"],"bio":{"p":["Slobodan Babic received the Dipl.

Units travel and battle separately, resulting in huge losses and the AI looking unintelligent, as can the choice of units sent to counteract the opponents. Players are affected as well as computer commanded factions because they cannot micromanage all team related issues. We suggest improving AI behavior by combining well-known computational intelligence techniques applied in an original way. Team composition for battling spatially distributed opponent groups is supported by a learning self-organizing map (SOM) that relies on an evolutionary algorithm (EA) to adapt it to the game. Different abilities of unit types are thus employed in a near-optimal way, reminiscent of human \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">ad hoc</i>\n decisions. Team movement is greatly enhanced by flocking and influence map-based path finding, leading to a more natural behavior by preserving individual motion types. The team decision to either attack or avoid a group of enemy units is easily parametrizable, incorporating team characteristics from fearful to daredevil. We demonstrate that these two approaches work well separately, but also that they go together naturally, thereby leading to an improved and flexible group behavior.","doi":"10.1109/TCIAIG.2010.2047645","startPage":"82","endPage":"98","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computational Intelligence and AI in

Unlike the reported modulation schemes that require a varying switching period (thereby resulting in high attenuation or complete elimination of discrete harmonics), the proposed RWAPPM conversely requires only a constant switching period (thereby advantageous in terms of easy realization in hardware), and yet, its discrete harmonics are negligible. We derive an expression for the spectrum of the RWAPPM scheme to analytically obtain the peak spectral power and ripple noise voltage of RWAPPM. This expression further provides insight to the parameters that influence the RWAPPM spectrum. We benchmark the RWAPPM scheme against the ubiquitous conventional pulsewidth modulation scheme and six reported (randomized and frequency modulation) schemes. The RWAPPM scheme features negligible discrete harmonics [\u2264 -158 dB relative to full scale (dBFS)], and among the modulation schemes, it features the lowest peak spectral power at -26.6 dBFS (before low-pass filtering) and relatively low ripple noise at 2 mV\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">rms</sub>\n (after low-pass filtering) for a 3.6-2.5-V conversion and an effective switching frequency of 120 kHz.

This paper presents a new PSO model, called PSO with composite particles (PSO-CP), to address dynamic optimization problems. PSO-CP partitions the swarm into a set of composite particles based on their similarity using a \u201cworst first\u201d principle. Inspired by the composite particle phenomenon in physics, the elementary members in each composite particle interact via a velocity-anisotropic reflection scheme to integrate valuable information for effectively and rapidly finding the promising optima in the search space. Each composite particle maintains the diversity by a scattering operator. In addition, an integral movement strategy is introduced to promote the swarm diversity. Experiments on a typical dynamic test benchmark problem provide a guideline for setting the involved parameters and show that PSO-CP is efficient in comparison with several state-of-the-art PSO algorithms for dynamic optimization problems.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5443533/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 April 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2010","dateOfInsertion":"15 November 2010","publicationDate":"Dec. 2010","accessionNumber":"11641534","pubMedId":"20371407","htmlLink":"/document/5443533/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"40","issue":"6","isDynamicHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Particle Swarm Optimization With Composite Particles in Dynamic Environments","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Particle Swarm Optimization With Composite Particles in Dynamic Environments","sourcePdf":"tsmcb-yang-2043527-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.108073S","chronDate":"Dec.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"3477","isNumber":"5593944","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3477","citationCount":"111","xplore-issue":"5593944","articleId":"5443533","onlineDate":"05 April 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5443535,"authors":[{"name":"Jing-Hua Xia","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, Singapore"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/27/5461010/5443535/5443535-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jing-Hua Xia received the B.S. degree in material science and engineering and the M.E. degree in electrical engineering from Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, China, in 1993 and 1997, respectively, and the M.E. degree in electrical computer engineering from the National University of Singapore, Singapore, in 2003.

The analysis will consider both pointlike and distributed targets in such a way as to cover all the cases that are relevant in the applications. In order to provide a tool for the evaluation of the impact of PDs on the analysis of an arbitrary scenario, a definition of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) will be introduced that accounts for both the presence of PDs and the characteristics of the imaged scene. In the case of pointlike targets, it will be shown that such definition of SNR allows reusing well known results following after the Neyman\u2013Pearson theory, thus providing a straightforward tool to asses phase-stability requirements for the detection and localization of multiple pointlike targets. In the case of distributed targets, instead, it will be provided a detailed analysis of the random fluctuations of the reconstructed scene as a function of the extent of the PDs, of the vertical structure of the imaged scene, and of the number of looks that are employed. Results from Monte Carlo simulations will be presented that fully support the theoretical developments within this paper. The most relevant conclusion of this paper is that the impact of PDs is more severe in the case where the imaged scene is characterized by a complex vertical structure or when multiple pointlike targets are present. As a consequence, it follows that the T-SAR analyses require either a higher phase stability or a more accurate phase calibration with respect to InSAR analyses. Finally, an example of phase-stability analysis and phase calibration of a real data set will be shown, based on a P-band data set relative to the forest site of Remningstorp, Sweden. </para>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5443544/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 April 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5443544/","dateOfInsertion":"17 June 2010","publicationDate":"July 2010","accessionNumber":"11442189","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"48","issue":"7","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"On the Role of Phase Stability in SAR Multibaseline Applications","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the Role of Phase Stability in SAR Multibaseline Applications","sourcePdf":"tgrs-tebaldini-2043738.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.11612S","chronDate":"July  2010","xplore-pub-id":"36","isNumber":"5487390","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"42","xplore-issue":"5487390","articleId":"5443544","onlineDate":"05 April 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":5443545,"authors":[{"name":"Jinhui Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Automatic Control, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/91/5536903/5443545/5443545-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jinhui Zhang was born in Hebei Province, China, in 1982.

It consists of two key elements: motion estimation and motion-compensated frame interpolation. It requires accurate motion trajectories to ensure quality results and low computational cost to ensure practical applications. This paper presents a novel motion estimation algorithm that combines the accuracy of maximum a posteriori probability (MAP) estimation with the speed of hierarchical block-matching algorithm (BMA). This MAP estimation uses three consecutive pictures, instead of the conventional two, and one previously estimated motion field to exploit the temporal correlation between motion fields and to determine motion in occluded areas. The optimization of the MAP estimation is performed using full-search and implemented by means of look-up tables. The full search ensures that the optimization converges to the global minimum, while the look-up tables dramatically reduce the computational cost. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm provides motion trajectories that are much more accurate than those obtained using either the full-search BMA or hierarchical BMA alone. Also, it is much faster than the full-search BMA.","doi":"10.1109/TBC.2010.2043896","startPage":"133","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Broadcasting","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Broadcasting","pdfPath":"/iel5/11/5471739/05443548.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TBC.2010.2043896","endPage":"141","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5471739","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Motion-Compensated Frame Rate Up-Conversion\u2014Part I: Fast Multi-Frame Motion Estimation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5443548/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 April 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2010","displayDocTitle":"Motion-Compensated Frame Rate Up-Conversion\u2014Part I: Fast Multi-Frame Motion Estimation","volume":"56","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/5443548/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"11341174","dateOfInsertion":"24 May 2010","publicationDate":"June 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Motion-Compensated Frame Rate Up-Conversion\u2014Part I: Fast Multi-Frame Motion Estimation","sourcePdf":"tbc-wang-2043896.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.086999S","chronDate":"June  2010","xplore-pub-id":"11","isNumber":"5471739","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"11","citationCount":"60","xplore-issue":"5471739","articleId":"5443548","onlineDate":"05 April 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5443550,"authors":[{"name":"Qiang-Tao Lai","affiliation":["Center of Microwave and RF Technologies, School of Electronic Information and Electrical Engineering, Shanghai Jiaotong University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Qiang-Tao","lastName":"Lai","id":"37407813600"},{"name":"Jun-Fa Mao","affiliation":["Center of Microwave and RF Technologies, School of Electronic Information and Electrical Engineering, Shanghai Jiaotong University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Jun-Fa","lastName":"Mao","id":"37278004000"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1531-1309"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-1764"}],"articleNumber":"5443550","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":15,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1126},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society","url":"http://www.mtt.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5443550","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Low-noise amplifiers","Broadband amplifiers","Feedback","Impedance matching","CMOS process","Gain","Bandwidth","Energy consumption","Noise measurement","Semiconductor device measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS analogue integrated circuits","impedance matching","low noise amplifiers","MMIC amplifiers","UHF amplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS low noise amplifier","dual-channel shunt technique","LNA","wideband input impedance matching","frequency 0.5 GHz to 11 GHz","size 0.18 mum","gain 10.2 dB","power 14.4 mW","noise figure 3.9 dB to 4.5 dB"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["CMOS","dual-channel shunt","low noise amplifier (LNA)","ultra-wideband (UWB)"]}],"abstract":"A 0.5-11 GHz CMOS low noise amplifier (LNA) is proposed, with a new dual-channel shunt technique implemented, where one channel uses inductive-series peaking to provide flat gain over 0.5 to 11 GHz, and another channel adopts resistive feedback to realize wideband input impedance matching.

It is shown that the proposed transformation has unity gain for the fundamental-frequency positive-sequence voltage vector, while its gain is equal to zero for some chosen components. Cascaded transformations can then be used for eliminating the fundamental-frequency negative-sequence vector, as well as chosen positive- and negative-sequence harmonic vector components and, thus, for accurately obtaining the fundamental-frequency positive-sequence voltage vector. The output of the last transformation block is input to a synchronous reference frame phase-locked loop for detecting frequency and position of the positive-sequence vector. A proposal for making the scheme frequency adaptive is also presented. The good performance of the proposed method is verified with simulations and experiments by using distorted and unbalanced signals, containing fundamental-frequency as well as positive- and negative-sequence harmonic components.

However, due to the nature of the wireless propagation in urban and indoor environments, the behavior of the range estimates in such environments is very different. Therefore, the performance assessment results obtained for the systems operating in open areas cannot be transferred to the ones deployed in realistic urban and indoor environments. In this paper, the systematic and random errors (accuracy and precision) and the dilution-of-precision (DOP) in harsh environments are derived for the two most common multilateration algorithms, as well as the performance theoretical benchmark. We show that these quantities are determined by geometric parameters that we call topology-assessment-weighted-barycentric-parameters (TAWBAP), which are the norm of weighted barycenters obtained from the positions of anchors and target. These parameters manage the performance of the multilateration process showing the influence of the geometric configuration in connection with the specific characteristics of each range estimate. The improvement in performance obtained by using the TAWBAP parameters as a network design rule is demonstrated by means of simulations as well as by measurements taken in a real indoor environment. This improvement outperforms at least 25% the one achieved by topology deployments that have been considered as optimal in the literature.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Topology Assessment Provided by Weighted Barycentric Parameters in Harsh Environment Wireless Location Systems","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2010.2047394","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/5484906/05443562.pdf","startPage":"3842","endPage":"3857","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2010.2047394","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5484906","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5443562","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5443562/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 April 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2010","displayDocTitle":"Topology Assessment Provided by Weighted Barycentric Parameters in Harsh Environment Wireless Location Systems","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"58","issue":"7","htmlLink":"/document/5443562/","dateOfInsertion":"14 June 2010","publicationDate":"July 2010","accessionNumber":"11432864","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Topology Assessment Provided by Weighted Barycentric Parameters in Harsh Environment Wireless Location Systems","sourcePdf":"tsp-mazuelas-2047394.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.120514S","chronDate":"July  2010","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"5484906","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"35","xplore-issue":"5484906","articleId":"5443562","onlineDate":"05 April 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5443569,"authors":[{"name":"Ian Blanes","affiliation":["Department of Information and Communications Engineering, Universitat Aut\u00f2noma Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/36/5487390/5443569/5443569-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Ian Blanes (S'05) received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in computer Science from the Universitat Aut\u00f2noma de Barcelona, Cerdanyola del Vall\u00e8s, Spain, in 2007, and 2008, respectively.

However, its use entails a very high computational cost. To overcome this computational cost and to increase its scalability, in this paper, we introduce a multilevel clustering approach for the KLT. As the set of different multilevel clustering structures is very large, a two-stage process is used to carefully pick the best members for each specific situation. First, several candidate structures are generated through local search and eigenthresholding methods, and then, candidates are further screened to select the best clustering configuration. Two multilevel clustering combinations are proposed for hyperspectral image compression: one with the coding performance of the KLT but with much lower computational requirements and increased scalability and another one that outperforms a lossy wavelet transform, as spectral decorrelator, in quality, cost, and scalability. Extensive experimental validation is performed, with images from both the AVIRIS and Hyperion sets, and with JPEG2000, 3D-TCE, and CCSDS-Image Data Compression recommendation as image coders. Experiments also include classification-based results produced by k-means clustering and Reed-Xiaoli anomaly detection.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cost and Scalability Improvements to the Karhunen\u2013Lo\u00eave Transform for Remote-Sensing Image Coding","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","doi":"10.1109/TGRS.2010.2042063","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel5/36/5487390/05443569.pdf","startPage":"2854","endPage":"2863","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2010.2042063","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5487390","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5443569","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5443569/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 April 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2010","displayDocTitle":"Cost and Scalability Improvements to the Karhunen\u2013Lo\u00eave Transform for Remote-Sensing Image Coding","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"48","issue":"7","htmlLink":"/document/5443569/","dateOfInsertion":"17 June 2010","publicationDate":"July 2010","accessionNumber":"11442186","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cost and Scalability Improvements to the Karhunen\u2013Lo\u00eave Transform for Remote-Sensing Image Coding","sourcePdf":"tgrs-blanes-2042063.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.131138S","chronDate":"July  2010","xplore-pub-id":"36","isNumber":"5487390","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"40","xplore-issue":"5487390","articleId":"5443569","onlineDate":"05 April 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5443574,"authors":[{"name":"Bo Dai","affiliation":["School of Engineering and Physical Sciences, Heriot-Watt University, Edinburgh, UK"],"firstName":"Bo","lastName":"Dai","id":"37397374100"},{"name":"Xu Wang","affiliation":["School of Engineering and Physical Sciences, Heriot-Watt University, Edinburgh, UK"],"firstName":"Xu","lastName":"Wang","id":"37281375200"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1041-1135"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0174"}],"articleNumber":"5443574","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":204},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Photonics Society","url":"http://www.PhotonicsSociety.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Security","Gold","Autocorrelation","Pulse generation","Mathematical model","Semiconductor device measurement","Gratings","Refractive index","Optical refraction","Optical variables control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Bragg gratings","code division multiplexing","decoding","optical communication equipment","optical fibre communication","security of data"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["0-\u03c0-phase-shifted superstructured fiber Bragg grating (","eavesdroppers","code sequence","code extraction","0-\u03c0 -SSFBG","security","time-spreading optical code-division multiple-access","encoder","decoder","time-spreading OCDMA"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Fiber Bragg grating (FBG)","optical code-division multiple-access (OCDMA)","phase coding","security"]}],"abstract":"The existence of dips in the waveform encoded by 0/\u03c0-phase-shifted superstructured fiber Bragg grating (0/\u03c0 -SSFBG) allows eavesdroppers to extract code sequence straightforwardly.

A recent study demonstrated muscle fatigue-induced weakening of functional corticomuscular coupling measured by coherence between the brain [electroencephalogram (EEG)] and muscle [electromyogram (EMG)] signals after a relatively long-duration muscle contraction. Comparing the EEG-EMG coherence before versus after fatigue or between data of two long-duration time blocks is not adequate to reveal the dynamic nature of the fatigue process. The purpose of this study was to address this issue by quantifying single-trial EEG-EMG coherence and EEG, EMG power based on wavelet transform. Eight healthy subjects performed 200 maximal intermittent handgrip contractions in a single session with handgrip force, EEG and EMG signals acquired simultaneously. The EEG and EMG data during each 2-s handgrip was subjected to single trial EEG-EMG wavelet energy spectrum and coherence computation. The EEG-EMG coherence and energy spectrum at beta (15 ~ 35 Hz) and gamma (35-50 Hz) frequency bands were statistically analyzed in 2-block (75 trials per block), 5-block (30 trials/block), and 10-block (15 trials/block) data settings. The energy of both the EEG and EMG signals decreased significantly with muscle fatigue. The EEG-EMG coherence had a significant reduction for the 2-block comparison. More detailed dynamical changing and inter-subject variation of the EEG-EMG coherence and energy were revealed by 5- and 10-block comparisons. These results show feasibility of wavelet transform-based measurement of the EEG-EMG coherence and corresponding energy based on single-trial data, which provides extra information to demonstrate a time course of dynamic adaptations of the functional corticomuscular coupling, as well as brain and muscle signals during muscle fatigue.","doi":"10.1109/TNSRE.2010.2047173","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Systems and Rehabilitation Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/7333/5455859/05443589.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5455859","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNSRE.2010.2047173","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Systems and Rehabilitation Engineering","startPage":"97","endPage":"106","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Single-Trial EEG-EMG Coherence Analysis Reveals Muscle Fatigue-Related Progressive Alterations in Corticomuscular Coupling","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5443589","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 April 2010","displayDocTitle":"Single-Trial EEG-EMG Coherence Analysis Reveals Muscle Fatigue-Related Progressive Alterations in Corticomuscular Coupling","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5443589/","volume":"18","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/5443589/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2010","accessionNumber":"11261007","pubMedId":"20371421","dateOfInsertion":"26 April 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Single-Trial EEG-EMG Coherence Analysis Reveals Muscle Fatigue-Related Progressive Alterations in Corticomuscular Coupling","sourcePdf":"tnsre-yue-2047173.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.116103S","chronDate":"April  2010","xplore-pub-id":"7333","isNumber":"5455859","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7333","citationCount":"41","xplore-issue":"5455859","articleId":"5443589","onlineDate":"05 April 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5443591,"authors":[{"name":"Jau-Horng Chen","affiliation":["Department of Engineering Science and Ocean Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Jau-Horng","lastName":"Chen","id":"37280678200"},{"name":"Hao-Shun Yang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Graduate Institute of Electronics Engineering, and Graduate Institute of Communication Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Hao-Shun","lastName":"Yang","id":"37403883200"},{"name":"Yi-Jan Emery Chen","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Graduate Institute of Electronics Engineering, and Graduate Institute of Communication Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Yi-Jan Emery","lastName":"Chen","id":"38185528100"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1531-1309"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-1764"}],"articleNumber":"5443591","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":29,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":736},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society","url":"http://www.mtt.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Pulse modulation","Digital modulation","Transmitters","Space vector pulse width modulation","Quantization","Noise level","Frequency modulation","Sampling methods","Signal resolution","Filtering"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiple access","pulse width modulation","radio transmitters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multilevel pulse modulated polar transmitter","digital pulse-width modulation","restoration transmitter","elimination transmitter","CDMA2000 IX signal","channel power ratios","frequency 836.5 MHz"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Microwave amplifiers","power amplifiers (PAs)","radio transmitters"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5443591","abstract":"This letter presents a multi-level pulse modulated polar transmitter architecture.

The high-frequency magnetic film, an amorphous CoZrTa, was integrated into standard silicon process technology. Inductors consume large amounts of chip area, but with magnetic materials, the inductors can be made smaller thereby reducing their capacitance and resistance. A novel 3-dimensional structure for reducing the inductor's resistance by an order of magnitude was also developed.

For such systems, the use of a multiple-input converter (MIC) has the advantage of simpler circuit structure and lower cost, compared to the use of several single-input converters. By decomposing converters into basic cells, namely, pulsating source cells and output filters, a set of basic rules for generating multiple-input converter topologies is proposed. Specifically, two families of multiple-input converters are systematically generated. In the first family of MICs, all the input sources can power the load simultaneously or individually. In the second family, only one power source is allowed to transfer energy to the load at a time. Furthermore, some isolated MICs are simplified for reducing the complexity of the circuit configuration.","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2010.2047273","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/63/5577584/05443596.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2010.2047273","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5577584","startPage":"2372","endPage":"2385","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Synthesis of Multiple-Input DC/DC Converters","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5443596","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Synthesis of Multiple-Input DC/DC Converters","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5443596/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 April 2010","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"25","issue":"9","publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","accessionNumber":"11527506","dateOfInsertion":"16 September 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5443596/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Synthesis of Multiple-Input DC/DC Converters","sourcePdf":"tpel-ruan-2047273-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.100976S","chronDate":"Sept.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"5577584","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"195","xplore-issue":"5577584","articleId":"5443596","onlineDate":"05 April 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-22"},{"_id":5443611,"authors":[{"name":"Hui Kong","affiliation":["Ohio State Uinversity, Columbus, OH, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/83/5510066/5443611/5443611-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Hui Kong (M'09) received the Ph.D. degree in computer vision from Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, in 2007.","He was a Postdoctoral Fellow in the Willow team of Ecole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure and the Imagine team of Ecole Nationale des Ponts from 2008 to 2009 in Paris.

This paper addresses this question by decomposing the road detection process into two steps: the estimation of the vanishing point associated with the main (straight) part of the road, followed by the segmentation of the corresponding road area based upon the detected vanishing point. The main technical contributions of the proposed approach are a novel adaptive soft voting scheme based upon a local voting region using high-confidence voters, whose texture orientations are computed using Gabor filters, and a new vanishing-point-constrained edge detection technique for detecting road boundaries. The proposed method has been implemented, and experiments with 1003 general road images demonstrate that it is effective at detecting road regions in challenging conditions.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5443611/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 April 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2010","volume":"19","issue":"8","publicationDate":"Aug. 2010","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"15 July 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5443611/","accessionNumber":"11416478","pubMedId":"20371404","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"General Road Detection From a Single Image","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"General Road Detection From a Single Image","sourcePdf":"19tip08-hkong-2045715-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.059092S","chronDate":"Aug.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"83","isNumber":"5510066","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"260","xplore-issue":"5510066","articleId":"5443611","onlineDate":"05 April 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":5443623,"authors":[{"name":"Xiao-Min Hu","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/3477/5593944/5443623/5443623-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Xiao-Min Hu (S'06) received the B.S. degree in network engineering in 2006 from Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou, China, where she is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree in computer application and technology in the Department of Computer Science.","Her current research interests include artificial intelligence, evolutionary computation, swarm intelligence, and their applications in design and optimization on wireless sensor networks, network routing technologies, and other intelligence applications."]},"firstName":"Xiao-Min","lastName":"Hu","id":"37311035700"},{"name":"Jun Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/3477/5593944/5443623/5443623-photo-2-source-small.gif","p":["Jun Zhang (M'02\u2013SM'08) received the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from the City University of Hong Kong, Kowloon, Hong Kong, in 2002.","From 2003 to 2004, he was a Brain Korean 21 Postdoctoral Fellow with the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejeon, South Korea.

Although ACO is first designed for solving discrete (combinatorial) optimization problems, the ACO procedure is also applicable to continuous optimization. This paper presents a new way of extending ACO to solving continuous optimization problems by focusing on continuous variable sampling as a key to transforming ACO from discrete optimization to continuous optimization. The proposed SamACO algorithm consists of three major steps, i.e., the generation of candidate variable values for selection, the ants' solution construction, and the pheromone update process. The distinct characteristics of SamACO are the cooperation of a novel sampling method for discretizing the continuous search space and an efficient incremental solution construction method based on the sampled values. The performance of SamACO is tested using continuous numerical functions with unimodal and multimodal features. Compared with some state-of-the-art algorithms, including traditional ant-based algorithms and representative computational intelligence algorithms for continuous optimization, the performance of SamACO is seen competitive and promising.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Ant colony optimization","Sampling methods","Design optimization","Sun","Scheduling algorithm","Testing","Computational intelligence","Particle swarm optimization","Traveling salesman problems","Routing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optimisation","sampling methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["SamACO","variable sampling ant colony optimization algorithm","continuous optimization","sampling method","continuous search space"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Ant algorithm","ant colony optimization (ACO)","ant colony system (ACS)","continuous optimization","function optimization","local search","numerical optimization"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Algorithms","Animals","Ants","Artificial Intelligence","Biomimetics","Computer Simulation","Feeding Behavior","Models, Biological"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TSMCB.2010.2043094","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part B (Cybernetics)","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part B (Cybernetics)","pdfPath":"/iel5/3477/5593944/05443623.pdf","startPage":"1555","endPage":"1566","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5593944","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSMCB.2010.2043094","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"SamACO: Variable Sampling Ant Colony Optimization Algorithm for Continuous Optimization","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5443623","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"SamACO: Variable Sampling Ant Colony Optimization Algorithm for Continuous Optimization","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5443623/","volume":"40","issue":"6","publicationDate":"Dec. 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5443623/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"11646824","pubMedId":"20371409","dateOfInsertion":"15 November 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 April 2010","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"SamACO: Variable Sampling Ant Colony Optimization Algorithm for Continuous Optimization","sourcePdf":"tsmcb-zhang-2043094-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.123935S","chronDate":"Dec.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"3477","isNumber":"5593944","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3477","citationCount":"48","xplore-issue":"5593944","articleId":"5443623","onlineDate":"05 April 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":5443625,"authors":[{"name":"Victor Rodolfo Gonzalez-Diaz","affiliation":["Optics and Electronics (INAOE), National Institute for Astrophysics Optics and Electronics, Puebla, Mexico"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8919/5592146/5443625/5443625-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Victor Rodolfo Gonzalez-Diaz (S'04\u2013M'10) was born in Puebla, Mexico.

However, as users come and go, the code tree structure will be fragmented and steeped in a high level of interference. In this situation, an active call may be dropped for not being able to reach a predefined signal quality. To solve this call-dropping problem, we propose a novel code-reassignment strategy to reallocate a low-interferenced code to the could-be-dropped call. This way, not only can this possible call-dropping event be evaded, but also, a low-interferenced 2-D code tree structure can be maintained. The simulation results show that the proposed code-reassignment method can efficiently alleviate the call-dropping problem and boost the call-survival rate simultaneously. It is believed that the proposed scheme fills up an important missing link of the dynamic call-resource management for the 2-D-spread MC-DS-CDMA system.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Downlink","Power control","Multiple access interference","Multiaccess communication","Tree data structures","Multicarrier code division multiple access","Interference elimination","Two dimensional displays","Control systems","Power system management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiple access","frequency-domain analysis","interference suppression","power control","spread spectrum communication","telecommunication network management","time-domain analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["interference-avoidance code reassignment strategy","downlink two-dimensional-spread MC-DS-CDMA systems","power control","2D time-domain system","frequency-domain system","spread multicarrier direct-sequenced code-division multiple-access system","interference level control","predefined signal quality","call-dropping problem","low-interferenced code reallocation","call-dropping event","low-interferenced 2D code tree structure","2D-spread MC-DS-CDMA system","dynamic call-resource management"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Code assignment and reassignment","interference avoidance","multiple-access interference (MAI) coefficient","multicarrier direct-sequenced code-division multiple access (MC-DS-CDMA)","power control (PC)"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5443644","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2010.2047329","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/5508587/05443644.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2010.2047329","startPage":"3104","endPage":"3108","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5508587","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Novel Interference-Avoidance Code Reassignment for Downlink Two-Dimensional-Spread MC-DS-CDMA Systems With Power Control","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A Novel Interference-Avoidance Code Reassignment for Downlink Two-Dimensional-Spread MC-DS-CDMA Systems With Power Control","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5443644/","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 April 2010","volume":"59","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/5443644/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"12 July 2010","publicationDate":"July 2010","accessionNumber":"11464904","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Novel Interference-Avoidance Code Reassignment for Downlink Two-Dimensional-Spread MC-DS-CDMA Systems With Power Control","sourcePdf":"tvt-chang-2047329-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.090665S","chronDate":"July  2010","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"5508587","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"5508587","articleId":"5443644","onlineDate":"05 April 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5443645,"authors":[{"name":"Saleh Abdel-Hafeez","affiliation":["IRBID, Jordan University of Science and Technology, Jordan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/92/5772207/5443645/5443645-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Saleh Abdel-Hafeez (M'02) received the Ph.D. degree in computer engineering from the University of Texas at El Paso, El Paso, and the M.S. degree from New Mexico State University, University Park.","He was a former Senior Member of technical staff at S3.inc and Viatechnologies.com in the area of mixed signal IC's design.

The state look-ahead path prepares the counting path's next counter state prior to the clock edge such that the clock edge triggers all modules simultaneously, thus concurrently updating the count state with a uniform delay at all counting path modules/stages with respect to the clock edge. The structure is scalable to arbitrary N-bit counter widths (2-to-2N range) using only the three module types and no fan-in or fan-out increase. The counter's delay is comprised of the initial module access time (a simple 2-bit counting stage), one three-input and-gate delay, and a D-type flip-flop setup-hold time. We implemented our proposed counter using a 0.15-\u03bc m TSMC digital cell library and verified maximum operating speeds of 2 and 1.8 GHz for 8- and 17-bit counters, respectively.

Voiced speech is sparse in the frequency domain and can be represented by sinusoidal tracks via sinusoidal modeling which provides high local signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). By utilizing the inter-channel phase differences (IPDs) between the dual channels on the sinusoidal tracks, the source localization of the mixed multiple speech sources is turned into a clustering problem on the IPD versus frequency plot. The generalized mixture decomposition algorithm (GMDA) is used to cluster the groups of points corresponding to multiple sources and thus estimate the direction of arrival (DOA) of the sources. Experiments illustrate the proposed GMDA algorithm with the Laplacian noise model can estimate the number of sources accurately and exhibits smaller DOA estimation error than the baseline histogram based DOA estimation algorithm in various scenarios including reverberant and additive white noise environments. Experiments suggest that appropriate power thresholding can be a simple and good approximation to the sinusoidal modeling, for the purpose of selecting time-frequency points with high local SNR, with slight loss in performance.","doi":"10.1109/TASL.2010.2040525","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/10376/5559658/05443663.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5559658","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TASL.2010.2040525","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","startPage":"1913","endPage":"1928","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Two Microphone-Based Approach for Source Localization of Multiple Speech Sources","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5443663","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 April 2010","displayDocTitle":"A Two Microphone-Based Approach for Source Localization of Multiple Speech Sources","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5443663/","volume":"18","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/5443663/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2010","accessionNumber":"11489145","dateOfInsertion":"30 August 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Two Microphone-Based Approach for Source Localization of Multiple Speech Sources","sourcePdf":"18tasl05-wzhang-2040525-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.097657S","chronDate":"Nov.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"10376","isNumber":"5559658","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10376","citationCount":"62","xplore-issue":"5559658","articleId":"5443663","onlineDate":"05 April 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5443665,"authors":[{"name":"Irene Y.

To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first one to propose a comprehensive solution that takes into account of all the possible crosstalk constraints for optical interconnection network fabrics. Therefore, the necessary and sufficient RNB conditions for optical interconnection networks under various crosstalk constraints are defined completely. Moreover, we found the conditions are independent from the degree of crosstalk constraint. It means the number of needed planes will not increase due to a stricter constraint by allowing a lower degree of crosstalk unless it goes down to zero crosstalk. It also signifies that a much stricter degree of crosstalk constraint could be imposed without changing the hardware fabrics. These conditions provide the useful tips for a cost-effective design of such optical interconnection networks.","doi":"10.1109/TNET.2010.2044515","publicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking","pdfPath":"/iel5/90/5602023/05443665.pdf","startPage":"1413","endPage":"1421","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNET.2010.2044515","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5602023","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Rearrangeable Nonblocking Optical Interconnection Network Fabrics With Crosstalk Constraints","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5443665","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 April 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5443665/","displayDocTitle":"Rearrangeable Nonblocking Optical Interconnection Network Fabrics With Crosstalk Constraints","volume":"18","issue":"5","publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","accessionNumber":"11581317","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5443665/","dateOfInsertion":"14 October 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Rearrangeable Nonblocking Optical Interconnection Network Fabrics With Crosstalk Constraints","sourcePdf":"tnet-ichen-2044515-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.094573S","chronDate":"Oct.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"90","isNumber":"5602023","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"90","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5602023","articleId":"5443665","onlineDate":"05 April 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5443679,"authors":[{"name":"Markus Koester","affiliation":["Department of Computing, Imperial College London, London, UK"],"bio":{"p":["Markus Koester received the Ph.D. degree from the University of Paderborn, Paderborn, Germany, in 2007, for his work on resource management for partially reconfigurable architectures.","In October 2007, he received a Post-Doctoral scholarship from the German Research Council (DFG) and continued his research on partial reconfiguration in the \"Custom Computing\" Research Group, Imperial College London, London, U.K. His works were focused on design optimizations for FPGA-based reconfigurable systems.

Dynamic system components are represented by partial reconfiguration (PR) modules. In comparison to a static system, the design of a partially reconfigurable system requires additional design steps, such as partitioning the device resources into static and dynamic regions. We present the concept of tiled PR regions, which enables a flexible online-placement of PR modules. Dynamic reconfiguration requires a suitable communication infrastructure to interconnect the static and dynamic system components. We present an embedded communication macro, a communication infrastructure that interconnects PR modules in a tiled PR region. Efficient online-placement of PR modules depends not only on the placement algorithm, but also on design-time aspects such as the chosen synthesis regions of the PR modules. We propose a design method for selecting suitable synthesis regions for the PR modules aiming to optimize their placement at run-time.","doi":"10.1109/TVLSI.2010.2044902","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/92/5772207/05443679.pdf","startPage":"1048","endPage":"1061","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVLSI.2010.2044902","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5772207","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design Optimizations for Tiled Partially Reconfigurable Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5443679","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 April 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5443679/","displayDocTitle":"Design Optimizations for Tiled Partially Reconfigurable Systems","volume":"19","issue":"6","publicationDate":"June 2011","accessionNumber":"12021678","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5443679/","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design Optimizations for Tiled Partially Reconfigurable Systems","sourcePdf":"tvlsi-koester-2044902-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.091802S","chronDate":"June  2011","xplore-pub-id":"92","isNumber":"5772207","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"38","xplore-issue":"5772207","articleId":"5443679","onlineDate":"05 April 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5443680,"authors":[{"name":"Nader Kalantari","affiliation":["ECE Department, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Nader","lastName":"Kalantari","id":"37396276600"},{"name":"James F.

This system uses a small magnet enclosed in the object to serve as excitation source, so it does not require the connection wire and power supply for the excitation signal. When the magnet moves, it establishes a static magnetic field around, whose intensity is related to the magnet's position and orientation. With the magnetic sensors, the magnetic intensities in some predetermined spatial positions can be detected, and the magnet's position and orientation parameters can be computed based on an appropriate algorithm. Here, we propose a real-time tracking system developed by a cubic magnetic sensor array made of Honeywell 3-axis magnetic sensors, HMC1043.

The near-field of the array is defined in terms of frequency and distance from the array. Directional beamforming is demonstrated given the near-field radial compensation filter, which yields a desired directional beampattern at a chosen distance from the array. This pattern deteriorates as the source draws away from the array. Next, a framework is presented for radial filter design, enabling distance discrimination between sources positioned in the same direction relative to the array. Design examples include Dolph-Chebyshev radial filtering, radial notch filtering, and numerical design. Performance is analyzed in terms of spatial response and robustness to noise. Results show radial filtering is practical for improving attenuation of far-field and near-field interfering sources relative to a desired source positioned in the same direction.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5443699/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 April 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"19","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"25 October 2010","accessionNumber":"11597481","htmlLink":"/document/5443699/","displayDocTitle":"Near-Field Spherical Microphone Array Processing With Radial Filtering","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Near-Field Spherical Microphone Array Processing With Radial Filtering","sourcePdf":"tasl-rafaely-2047421-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.11258S","chronDate":"Feb.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"10376","isNumber":"5609232","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10376","citationCount":"43","xplore-issue":"5609232","articleId":"5443699","onlineDate":"05 April 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5443705,"authors":[{"name":"Michael Stark","affiliation":["Signal Processing and Speech Communication Laboratory, Graz University of Technology, Graz, Austria"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/10376/5609232/5443705/5443705-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Michael Stark (S'07) received the M.Sc.

The objective is to find these objects. GPS information is used to roughly align the two videos and find the corresponding frame pairs. Based upon the GPS alignment, four simple but effective ideas are proposed to achieve the objective: an intersequence geometric alignment based upon homographies, which is computed by a modified RANSAC, to find all possible suspicious areas, an intrasequence geometric alignment to remove false alarms caused by high objects, a local appearance comparison between two aligned intrasequence frames to remove false alarms in flat areas, and a temporal filtering step to confirm the existence of suspicious objects. Experiments on fifteen pairs of videos show the promise of the proposed method.","doi":"10.1109/TIP.2010.2045714","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/83/5510066/05443707.pdf","startPage":"2201","endPage":"2210","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIP.2010.2045714","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5510066","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Detecting Abandoned Objects With a Moving Camera","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5443707","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 April 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5443707/","displayDocTitle":"Detecting Abandoned Objects With a Moving Camera","volume":"19","issue":"8","publicationDate":"Aug. 2010","accessionNumber":"11416473","pubMedId":"20371405","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5443707/","dateOfInsertion":"15 July 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Detecting Abandoned Objects With a Moving Camera","sourcePdf":"19tip08-hkong-2045714-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.094245S","chronDate":"Aug.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"83","isNumber":"5510066","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"34","xplore-issue":"5510066","articleId":"5443707","onlineDate":"05 April 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5443709,"authors":[{"name":"Ayman Assra","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Concordia University, Montreal, QUE, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/5508587/5443709/5443709-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Ayman Assra received the B.Sc. degree in electrical engineering from Alexandria University, Alexandria, Egypt, in 2000 and the M.Sc. degree from the Arab Academy for Science and Technology and Maritime Transport, Alexandria, in 2004.

Channel estimation based on training techniques has widely been considered throughout the literature. However, employing these training techniques in MIMO-CDMA systems degrades system performance due to multiuser interference. This degradation is clear as the diversity advantage of the MIMO system diminishes with the increased level of interference. As a remedy to this problem, we propose a channel-estimation and data-detection scheme based on the superimposed training technique for space-time spreading systems. The proposed scheme enhances the performance of the space-time system by eliminating the interference effect from both the channel and data estimates using two decorrelators: channel and data decorrelators. We investigate the performance of the proposed estimation technique considering an asynchronous CDMA uplink transmission over frequency-selective slow-fading channels. In particular, we analyze the bit-error-rate (BER) performance of the multiuser system with two-transmit-antenna and \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">V</i>\n-receive-antenna configuration over Rayleigh fading channels. Compared with other conventional estimation techniques, our results show that the proposed estimation technique is more robust to channel-estimation errors. Furthermore, both simulations and analytical results indicate that full system diversity is achieved.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2010.2047417","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/5508587/05443709.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2010.2047417","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5508587","startPage":"2830","endPage":"2844","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Channel-Estimation and Data-Detection Scheme for Multiuser MIMO-CDMA Systems in Fading Channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5443709","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A Channel-Estimation and Data-Detection Scheme for Multiuser MIMO-CDMA Systems in Fading Channels","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5443709/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 April 2010","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"59","issue":"6","publicationDate":"July 2010","accessionNumber":"11464906","dateOfInsertion":"12 July 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5443709/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Channel-Estimation and Data-Detection Scheme for Multiuser MIMO-CDMA Systems in Fading Channels","sourcePdf":"tvt-hamouda-2047417-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.131604S","chronDate":"July  2010","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"5508587","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5508587","articleId":"5443709","onlineDate":"05 April 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5443717,"authors":[{"name":"Michiel A.

The associated temperature calibration procedure is time consuming and therefore costly. This paper presents two, much faster, voltage calibration techniques. Both make use of the fact that a voltage proportional to absolute temperature (PTAT) can be accurately generated on chip. By measuring this voltage, the sensor's actual temperature can be determined, whereupon the sensor can be trimmed to correct for its dominant source of error: spread in the on-chip voltage reference. The first calibration technique consists of measuring the (small) PTAT voltage directly, while the second, more robust alternative does so indirectly, by using an external reference voltage and the on-chip ADC. Experimental results from a prototype fabricated in 0.7 \u00bfm CMOS technology show that after calibration and trimming, these two techniques result in measurement errors (\u00b13\u00bf) of \u00b10.15\u00b0C and \u00b10.25\u00b0C, respectively, in a range from -55\u00b0C to 125\u00b0C.","doi":"10.1109/JSEN.2010.2040730","publicationTitle":"IEEE Sensors Journal","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Sensors Journal","pdfPath":"/iel5/7361/5443637/05443717.pdf","startPage":"1098","endPage":"1105","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSEN.2010.2040730","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5443637","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Low-Cost Calibration Techniques for Smart Temperature Sensors","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5443717/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 April 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2010","displayDocTitle":"Low-Cost Calibration Techniques for Smart Temperature Sensors","volume":"10","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"June 2010","accessionNumber":"11208186","htmlLink":"/document/5443717/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"05 April 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low-Cost Calibration Techniques for Smart Temperature Sensors","sourcePdf":"jsen-mpertijs-2040730.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.092642S","chronDate":"June  2010","xplore-pub-id":"7361","isNumber":"5443637","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7361","citationCount":"29","xplore-issue":"5443637","articleId":"5443717","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5443719,"authors":[{"name":"Y.

with analog signals, especially in the case of the bipolar optical orthogonal frequency-division-multiplexing (O-OFDM) signal, leads to significant signal degradation due to LED nonlinearity. The LED transfer function distorts the signal amplitude and forces the lower peaks to be clipped at the LED turn-on voltage. Additionally, the upper peaks are purposely clipped before modulating the LED to avoid chip overheating. The induced distortion can be controlled by optimizing the bias point or backing-off the average O-OFDM signal power. In this letter, a model that incorporates amplitude distortion and that provides a parameterized upper clipping is proposed. Through Monte Carlo simulations, the model can be used to determine the optimum bias point and to optimize the O-OFDM signal power. In this context, a novel concept of soft-clipping of the upper peaks is presented. It is shown that soft-clipping is an effective approach to reduce nonlinearity distortion and to enhance symbol error performance.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5443738/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 April 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"June1,  2010","volume":"22","issue":"11","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11340979","dateOfInsertion":"13 May 2010","publicationDate":"June1, 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5443738/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"An LED Model for Intensity-Modulated Optical Communication Systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An LED Model for Intensity-Modulated Optical Communication Systems","sourcePdf":"lpt-helgala-2046157-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.063969S","chronDate":"June1,  2010","xplore-pub-id":"68","isNumber":"5458299","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"68","citationCount":"118","xplore-issue":"5458299","articleId":"5443738","onlineDate":"05 April 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5443743,"authors":[{"name":"Hennie Daniels","affiliation":["ERIM Institute of Advanced Management Studies, Erasmus University Rotterdam, Rotterdam, Netherlands","Center of Economic Research, Tilburg University, Tilburg, Netherlands"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/72/5475433/5443743/5443743-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Hennie Daniels received the M.S. degree (cum laude) in mathematics and computer science from the Technical University of Eindhoven, Eindhoven, The Netherlands, in 1977 and the Ph.D. degree in theoretical physics from Groningen University, Groninge, The Netherlands, in 1982.","Currently, he is a Professor of Business Intelligence at the Rotterdam School of Management, Erasmus University, Rotterdam, The Netherlands and Associate Professor at the School of Economics and Business Administration, Tilburg University, Tilburg, The Netherlands.

Monotone neural networks can be used as powerful tools to build monotone models with better accuracy and lower variance compared to ordinary nonmonotone models. Monotonicity is usually obtained by putting constraints on the parameters of the network. In this paper, we will clarify some of the theoretical results on monotone neural networks with positive weights, issues that are sometimes misunderstood in the neural network literature. Furthermore, we will generalize some of the results obtained by Sill for the so-called min-max networks to the case of partially monotone problems. The method is illustrated in practical case studies.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast

the European Commission, a consortium of 23 European partners, consisting of universities, research institutions, industries, and organizations operating in the field of emergency management, is developing a new generation of \u00bfsmart\u00bf garments for emergency-disaster personnel. Garments integrate newly developed wearable and textile solutions, such as commercial portable sensors and devices, in order to continuously monitor risks endangering rescuers' lives. The system enables detection of health-state parameters of the users (heart rate, breathing rate, body temperature, blood oxygen saturation, position, activity, and posture) and environmental variables (external temperature, presence of toxic gases, and heat flux passing through the garments), to process data and remotely transmit useful information to the operation manager. The European-integrated project, called ProeTEX (Protection e-Textiles: Micro-Nano-Structured fiber systems for Emergency-Disaster Wear) started on February, 2006 and will end on July, 2010. During this 4.5 years period, three subsequent generations of sensorized garments are being released.

The BCI system described in this work is based on the P300 wave. The P300 is a positive peak of an event-related potential (ERP) that occurs 300 ms after a stimulus. One of the best-known and most widely used P300 applications is the P300 speller designed by Farwell-Donchin in 1988. The Farwell-Donchin paradigm has been a benchmark for P300 BCIs. In this paradigm, a 6 X 6 matrix of letters and numbers is displayed, and the subject focuses on a target character while rows and columns of characters flash. Through detection of P300 for one row and one column, the target character can be identified. In this paper, it is shown that there is a human perceptual error in the Farwell-Donchin paradigm. To eliminate this error, a new region-based paradigm is presented. Using experimental results, it is shown that the new paradigm has several advantages over the Farwell-Donchin paradigm and achieves better accuracy.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A region-based P300 speller for brain-computer interface","publicationTitle":"Canadian Journal of Electrical and Computer Engineering","doi":"10.1109/CJECE.2009.5443854","displayPublicationTitle":"Canadian Journal of Electrical and Computer Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/9754/5443853/05443854.pdf","startPage":"81","endPage":"85","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CJECE.2009.5443854","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5443853","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5443854","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5443854/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Summer  2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Summer  2009","displayDocTitle":"A region-based P300 speller for brain-computer interface","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"34","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/5443854/","dateOfInsertion":"08 April 2010","publicationDate":"Summer 2009","accessionNumber":"11227773","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A region-based P300 speller for brain-computer interface","sourcePdf":"1-2006-fazel-FINAL.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.075701S","chronDate":"Summer  2009","xplore-pub-id":"9754","isNumber":"5443853","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9754","citationCount":"66","xplore-issue":"5443853","articleId":"5443854","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5443857,"authors":[{"name":"Ramtin Hadidi","affiliation":["Faculty of Engineering and Applied Science, Memorial University, Saint John's, NEW, Canada"],"bio":{"p":["Ramtin Hadidi received his B.S. degree in electrical engineering from K.N.

A near-optimal coordinated design for several PSSs is achieved using reinforcement learning. The objective of the control policy is to enhance the stability of a multi-machine power system by increasing the damping ratio of the least-damped modes. An RL method called Q-learning is applied to find a near-optimal control policy for controlling PSSs. With this control policy, the agent can change the gain of PSSs automatically in such a way that a predefined goal is nearly always satisfied. A modified Q-learning algorithm is proposed to enhance the convergence speed of the conventional algorithm toward a near-optimal policy. This is achieved by using selective initial state criteria instead of choosing the initial state randomly in each episode. The validity of the proposed method has been tested on a two-area, four-machine power system using nonlinear time-domain simulation under severe disturbances.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5443853","publicationTitle":"Canadian Journal of Electrical and Computer Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"Canadian Journal of Electrical and Computer Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/9754/5443853/05443857.pdf","doi":"10.1109/CJECE.2009.5443857","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CJECE.2009.5443857","startPage":"99","endPage":"103","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reinforcement learning approach for controlling power system stabilizers","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Summer  2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Summer  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5443857/","displayDocTitle":"Reinforcement learning approach for controlling power system stabilizers","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5443857/","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"34","issue":"3","accessionNumber":"11227776","dateOfInsertion":"08 April 2010","publicationDate":"Summer 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reinforcement learning approach for controlling power system stabilizers","sourcePdf":"4-stu-hadidi-FINAL.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.155857S","chronDate":"Summer  2009","xplore-pub-id":"9754","isNumber":"5443853","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9754","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"5443853","articleId":"5443857","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5443860,"authors":[{"name":"M.

As the precise wirelength for a given placement can only be known after routing, accurate and fast-to-compute wirelength estimates are required by FPGA placement algorithms. In this paper, a new model, called star+, is presented for estimating wirelength during FPGA placement. The proposed model is continuously differentiable and can be used with both analytic and iterative-improvement placement methods. Moreover, the time required to calculate incremental changes in cost incurred by moving/swapping blocks can always be computed in O(1) time. Results show that when incorporated into the well-known VPR framework and tested using the 20 MCNC benchmarks, the star+ model achieves a 6-9% reduction in critical-path delay compared with the half-perimeter wirelength (HPWL) model, while requiring roughly the same amount of computational effort.","displayPublicationTitle":"Canadian Journal of Electrical and Computer Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/9754/5443853/05443860.pdf","startPage":"125","endPage":"132","publicationTitle":"Canadian Journal of Electrical and Computer Engineering","doi":"10.1109/CJECE.2009.5443860","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CJECE.2009.5443860","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5443853","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5443860","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Near-linear wirelength estimation for FPGA placement","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Field programmable gate arrays","Routing","Very large scale integration","Logic arrays","Delay","Energy consumption","Logic devices","Integrated circuit interconnections","Cost function","Integrated circuit technology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","integrated circuit design","integrated circuit modelling","VLSI"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["near linear wirelength estimation","FPGA placement algorithm","integrated circuit technology","VLSI physical design automation","star+ model","iterative-improvement placement method","moving blocks","swapping blocks","incremental cost change calculation","VPR framework","20 MCNC benchmarks","critical-path delay","half-perimeter wirelength model"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5443860/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Summer  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Summer  2009","displayDocTitle":"Near-linear wirelength estimation for FPGA placement","volume":"34","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/5443860/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Summer 2009","accessionNumber":"11227779","dateOfInsertion":"08 April 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Near-linear wirelength estimation for FPGA placement","sourcePdf":"7-stu-xu-FINAL.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.188928S","chronDate":"Summer  2009","xplore-pub-id":"9754","isNumber":"5443853","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9754","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"5443853","articleId":"5443860","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5444285,"authors":[{"name":"Je-Hyoung Park","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of California, Santa Cruz, Santa Cruz, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Je-Hyoung","lastName":"Park","id":"37407048600"},{"name":"Sangho Shin","affiliation":["School of Engineering, University of California Merced, Merced, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Sangho","lastName":"Shin","id":"37291324300"},{"name":"James Christofferson","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of California, Santa Cruz, Santa Cruz, CA, USA"],"firstName":"James","lastName":"Christofferson","id":"37283997300"},{"name":"Ali Shakouri","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of California, Santa Cruz, Santa Cruz, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Ali","lastName":"Shakouri","id":"37284800600"},{"name":"Sung-Mo Kang","affiliation":["School of Engineering, University of California Merced, Merced, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Sung-Mo","lastName":"Kang","id":"37276368800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9460-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9458-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-9459-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9461-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1065-2221"},{"format":"CD","value":"1065-2221"}],"articleNumber":"5444285","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":181},"abstract":"Accurate estimation of temperature profiles from the underlying power dissipation profiles has become an important tool for chip designers and reliability engineers due to increasing power dissipation in ICs and associated thermal effects. IC's surface temperature is conventionally calculated by finite element or finite difference solvers. These methods yield accurate results but the computation time could be several hours to obtain accurate dynamic temperature profiles with high spatial resolution. Previously, we have developed an ultra fast IC temperature profile calculation technique, named as Power Blurring (PB), which dramatically reduces the computation time by a factor of more than a thousand and keeps the error within 5% comparing to finite element analysis done by ANSYS. In this paper, the power blurring method is validated against experimental measurements using a thermal test chip which was designed based on 5-stage ring oscillators. The simulation results and the measurement data show good agreements.","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 26th Annual IEEE Semiconductor Thermal Measurement and Management Symposium (SEMI-THERM)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5440519/5444271/05444285.pdf","startPage":"240","endPage":"244","publicationTitle":"2010 26th Annual IEEE Semiconductor Thermal Measurement and Management Symposium (SEMI-THERM)","doi":"10.1109/STHERM.2010.5444285","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/STHERM.2010.5444285","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5444271","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5444285","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Experimental validation of the power blurring method","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Temperature","Power dissipation","Finite element methods","Semiconductor device measurement","Reliability engineering","Design engineering","Power engineering and energy","Thermal engineering","Finite difference methods","Power engineering computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["finite element analysis","integrated circuit design","integrated circuit measurement","temperature distribution","temperature measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power blurring method","surface temperature","finite element method","finite difference solvers","spatial resolution","ultra fast IC temperature profile calculation technique","thermal test chip"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Thermal simulation","Power Blurring","Power dissipation profile (power map)","Temperature distribution (thermal profile)","Green's function technique","Finite element method (FEM)","Thermal test chip","Ring oscillator"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5444285/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-25 Feb. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Experimental validation of the power blurring method","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5444285/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2010","accessionNumber":"11230135","dateOfInsertion":"08 April 2010","conferenceDate":"21-25 Feb. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Experimental validation of the power blurring method","confLoc":"Santa Clara, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"s09p3.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069567S","chronDate":"21-25 Feb. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5440519","isNumber":"5444271","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5440519","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"5444271","articleId":"5444285","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5444353,"authors":[{"name":"Mohamad Forouzanfar","affiliation":["School of Information Technology & Engineering (SITE), University of Ottawa, Ottawa, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Mohamad","lastName":"Forouzanfar","id":"37396310300"},{"name":"Hilmi R.

Since the conventional oscillometric algorithms cannot model and extract the complex and nonlinear relationship that may exist between BP and oscillometric waveform, artificial neural networks (NNs) have been proposed as a possible alternative. However, the research on this topic has been limited to some simple architectures that directly estimate the BP from raw oscillation amplitudes (OAs). In this paper, we propose principal component analysis as a preprocessing step to decorrelate the OAs and extract the most effective components. Two architectures of NNs, namely, feed-forward and cascade-forward, are employed to estimate the BP using the preprocessed OAs. The networks are trained using the gradient descent with momentum and adaptive learning rate backpropagation algorithm and tested on a dataset of 85 BP waveforms. The performance is then compared with that of the conventional maximum amplitude algorithm and already published NN-based methods. It is found that the proposed networks achieve lower values of mean absolute error and standard deviation of error in estimation of BP compared with the other studied methods.","doi":"10.1109/TIC-STH.2009.5444353","startPage":"981","endPage":"986","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Toronto International Conference Science and Technology for Humanity

VPAT allows input of customizable coding schemes, quick and easy insertion of codes into text documents with a user-friendly interface, and extraction of codes for analysis purposes. VPAT was developed for research purposes with user-centered design methods with various stakeholders. The VPAT prototype runs in conjunction with MS Access and MS Excel.

Secondary users can perform the spectrum sensing either individually or cooperatively by exchanging local observations among them. This paper presents individual spectrum sensing challenges such as hidden terminal problem, shadowing, fading, and hardware limitations. The study also discusses the benefits gained by cooperative spectrum sensing. A detailed review of up-to-date cooperative spectrum sensing techniques is given in this work along with the various sensing schemes that implement these techniques. Out review shows that cooperative spectrum sensing can improve the cognitive radio network performance by increasing spectrum efficiency and providing a better detection accuracy. However, the benefits come at the cost of increased overhead traffic, power consumption, complexity, and the need for control channels. We believe that challenges of the cooperative sensing will be the subject of many future studies yet to be done.","doi":"10.1109/TIC-STH.2009.5444402","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Toronto International Conference Science and Technology for Humanity (TIC-STH)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5438532/5444349/05444402.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5444349","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIC-STH.2009.5444402","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Toronto International Conference Science and Technology for Humanity (TIC-STH)","startPage":"736","endPage":"741","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Spectrum sensing in cognitive radio networks: Up-to-date techniques and future challenges","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5444402","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-27 Sept. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Spectrum sensing in cognitive radio networks: Up-to-date techniques and future challenges","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5444402/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5444402/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"11229823","dateOfInsertion":"08 April 2010","conferenceDate":"26-27 Sept. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spectrum sensing in cognitive radio networks: Up-to-date techniques and future challenges","confLoc":"Toronto, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"p736hussain.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068175S","chronDate":"26-27 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5438532","isNumber":"5444349","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5438532","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"5444349","articleId":"5444402","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":5444414,"authors":[{"name":"T.

The proposed buffer achieves high-speed driving performance, draws a small quiescent current during static operation and offers a rail-to-rail common-mode input range. The circuit provides enhanced slewing capabilities with a limited power consumption by exploiting two current comparators embodied in the input stage, which sense the input signal transients to turn on the output stage transistors. A rail-to-rail stacked mirror differential amplifier is used to amplify the input signal difference and supply the bias voltages for the output stage. Post-layout simulations show that the proposed buffer can drive a 1-nF column line load within 1.8-\u00bfs settling time under a full voltage swing, while drawing only 3.5-\u00bfA static current from a 3-V power supply.

With increasing demand on the complexity of the models and scenarios that must be simulated to develop interactive applications such as surgical simulators, and given the current state of hardware, a nai\u00bfve solution strategy based on iterative finite element algorithms is not feasible. However, much advantage may be gained if the deformation response of the computational models may be characterized a priori and a radial basis function neural network (RBFN) is trained based upon this data. Once trained, the RBFN may be used during real time computations to calculate deformation fields and reaction forces with minimal computational cost. However, traditional RBFNs have zeroth order polynomial accuracy, implying that they cannot recreate polynomial fields. Since the error in the RBFN approximation is governed by the highest order of the polynomial that the approximant can reproduce, we have developed and successfully tested a higher order polynomial reproducing RBFN (HOPR-RBFN) which, compared to traditional RBFN, reduces the approximation error significantly and allows much fewer neurons to be used for comparable accuracy. Results are provided for realistic surgical scenarios with hyperelastic (neo-Hookean) material models within a fully nonlinear large deformation simulation

In order to capture tool displacements on surfaces we designed a slip sensor based on an optical mouse sensor. Calibration experiments were performed to ensure accurate readings on rigid and deformable surfaces. For slow tool movements this calibration led to very accurate slip measurements. Moreover, we extended our rendering algorithm to incorporate slip measurements. For the rendering a simple slip model was evaluated. Results revealed that the slip model was able to reproduce some slip effects, however, not all dynamic phenomena could be recreated.

This task becomes extremely difficult when the fingers are not in direct contact with the tissue, such as in laparoscopic or robot-assisted procedures. Tactile sensors have been proposed to characterize and detect lumps in robot-assisted palpation. In this work, we compare the performance of a capacitive tactile sensor with that of the human finger. We evaluate the response of the sensor as it pertains to robot-assisted palpation and compare the sensor performance to that of human subjects performing an equivalent task on the same set of artificial tissue models. Furthermore, we investigate the effects of various tissue parameters (lump size, lump depth, and surrounding tissue stiffness) on the performance of both the human finger and the tactile sensor. Using signal detection theory for determining tactile sensor lump detection thresholds, the tactile sensor outperforms the human finger in a palpation task.","doi":"10.1109/HAPTIC.2010.5444685","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Haptics Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Haptics Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/5439369/5444605/05444685.pdf","startPage":"21","endPage":"28","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/HAPTIC.2010.5444685","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5444605","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Human vs. robotic tactile sensing: Detecting lumps in soft tissue","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5444685","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-26 March 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5444685/","displayDocTitle":"Human vs. robotic tactile sensing: Detecting lumps in soft tissue","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"March 2010","accessionNumber":"11230049","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5444685/","conferenceDate":"25-26 March 2010","dateOfInsertion":"08 April 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Human vs. robotic tactile sensing: Detecting lumps in soft tissue","confLoc":"Waltham, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"021028gwilliam.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073219S","chronDate":"25-26 March 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5439369","isNumber":"5444605","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5439369","citationCount":"41","xplore-issue":"5444605","articleId":"5444685","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5444808,"authors":[{"name":"Joseph L.

In many cases, outdoor environmental conditions can dramatically alter users' color perception of user interface elements, by for example, washing out text or icon colors. As a result, users' semantic interpretation of interface elements can be compromised, rendering interface designs useless or counter-productive - an especially critical problem in application domains where color encoding is critical, such as military or medical visualization. In this paper, we present our experiences designing and constructing an optical AR testbed that emulates outdoor lighting conditions and allows us to measure the combined color of real-world backgrounds and virtual colors as projected through an optical see-through display. We present a formalization of color blending in AR, which supports further research on perceived color in AR displays. We describe an engineering study where we measure the color of light that reaches an optical see-through display user's eye under systematically varied virtual and real-world conditions. Our results further quantify the effect of lighting and background color on the color of virtual graphics, and specifically quantify how virtual colors change based on different real-world backgrounds.","doi":"10.1109/VR.2010.5444808","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5444743","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VR.2010.5444808","endPage":"86","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Virtual Reality Conference (VR)","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Virtual Reality Conference (VR)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5440859/5444743/05444808.pdf","startPage":"79","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"More than meets the eye: An engineering study to empirically examine the blending of real and virtual color spaces","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"20-24 March 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5444808/","displayDocTitle":"More than meets the eye: An engineering study to empirically examine the blending of real and virtual color spaces","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"20-24 March 2010","accessionNumber":"11230183","dateOfInsertion":"08 April 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5444808/","publicationDate":"March 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"More than meets the eye: An engineering study to empirically examine the blending of real and virtual color spaces","confLoc":"Boston, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"079086gabbard.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.076561S","chronDate":"20-24 March 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5440859","isNumber":"5444743","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5440859","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"5444743","articleId":"5444808","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5444860,"authors":[{"name":"Younes Rakhshani Fatmehsari","affiliation":["University of Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Younes Rakhshani","lastName":"Fatmehsari","id":"37671374200"},{"name":"Alireza Ghahari","affiliation":["University of Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Alireza","lastName":"Ghahari","id":"37586831500"},{"name":"Reza A.

Then by recognizing the type of traffic sign, it can warn the driver. Most of them use the HIS color space for detection of road signs. But in this paper the YCbCr color space is used. This paper proposes a new method for both detection and classification of red road signs. The strategy consists of three steps. In the first step the input image has been transferred from the RGB color space to the YCbCr color space and the red pixels are extracted. Then the road sign object is detected from those that had been extracted as red objects. In the second step this road sign image must be convolved with a bank of Gabor wavelets and extract the feature vectors for classification. Finally in the third step these feature vectors are classified by a hybrid classifier that is composed of one-vs.-rest support vector machines (OVR SVMs) and naive bayes (NBs) classifier. The proposed method was implemented for classification of four classes of red road signs and achieved the accuracy of 93.1%. Moreover the proposed method is robust against the translation, rotation, and scale.","doi":"10.1109/MCIT.2010.5444860","startPage":"25","endPage":"28","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Multimedia Computing and Information Technology (MCIT)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5439159/5444741/05444860.pdf","publicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Multimedia Computing and Information Technology (MCIT)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MCIT.2010.5444860","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5444741","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Gabor wavelet for road sign detection and recognition using a hybrid classifier","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Roads","Decision support systems","Intelligent vehicles","Image analysis","Layout","Smart cameras","Vehicle detection","Pixel","Object detection","Feature extraction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["automated highways","Bayes methods","feature extraction","Gabor filters","image colour analysis","object detection","support vector machines","wavelet transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Gabor wavelet","road sign recognition","hybrid classifier","driver support system","intelligent vehicle","road scenes image analyzation","HIS color space","YCbCr color space","red road signs detection","RGB color space","red pixels extraction","feature vectors extraction","one-vs-rest support vector machines","naive bayes classifier"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Road sign recognition","YCbCr color space","Gabor wavelet","one-vs.-rest support vector machines (OVR SVMs)","na\u00efve bayes classifier (NBs)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5444860/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-4 March 2010","displayDocTitle":"Gabor wavelet for road sign detection and recognition using a hybrid classifier","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5444860/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2010","dateOfInsertion":"08 April 2010","conferenceDate":"2-4 March 2010","accessionNumber":"11229961","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Gabor wavelet for road sign detection and recognition using a hybrid classifier","confLoc":"Sharjah, United Arab Emirates","sourcePdf":"p25rakhshanifatmehsari.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055163S","chronDate":"2-4 March 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5439159","isNumber":"5444741","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5439159","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"5444741","articleId":"5444860","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-17"},{"_id":5444872,"authors":[{"name":"Arjan Gijsenij","affiliation":["Intelligent Systems Laboratory Amsterdam (ISLA), University of Amsterdam, Netherlands"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/34/5715914/5444872/5444872-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Arjan Gijsenij received the MSc degree in computer science from the University of Groningen in 2005, and the PhD degree from the University of Amsterdam.

As a consequence, no algorithm can be considered as universal. However, with the large variety of available methods, the question is how to select the method that performs best for a specific image. To achieve selection and combining of color constancy algorithms, in this paper natural image statistics are used to identify the most important characteristics of color images. Then, based on these image characteristics, the proper color constancy algorithm (or best combination of algorithms) is selected for a specific image. To capture the image characteristics, the Weibull parameterization (e.g., grain size and contrast) is used. It is shown that the Weibull parameterization is related to the image attributes to which the used color constancy methods are sensitive. An MoG-classifier is used to learn the correlation and weighting between the Weibull-parameters and the image attributes (number of edges, amount of texture, and SNR). The output of the classifier is the selection of the best performing color constancy method for a certain image. Experimental results show a large improvement over state-of-the-art single algorithms. On a data set consisting of more than 11,000 images, an increase in color constancy performance up to 20 percent (median angular error) can be obtained compared to the best-performing single algorithm. Further, it is shown that for certain scene categories, one specific color constancy algorithm can be used instead of the classifier considering several algorithms.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel5/34/5715914/05444872.pdf","startPage":"687","endPage":"698","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","doi":"10.1109/TPAMI.2010.93","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPAMI.2010.93","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5715914","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5444872","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Color Constancy Using Natural Image Statistics and Scene Semantics","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Statistics","Layout","Computer vision","Lighting","Light sources","Diversity reception","Color","Grain size","Computer errors","Humans"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image classification","image colour analysis","image texture","Weibull distribution"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["color constancy methods","natural image statistics","scene semantics","Weibull parameterization","image characteristics","MoG-classifier","edge attribute","texture attribute","signal-to-noise ratio attribute"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Color constancy","illuminant estimation","natural image statistics","scene semantics","computer vision."]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Algorithms","Color","Image Enhancement","Image Processing, Computer-Assisted","Reproducibility of Results","Semantics","Sensitivity and Specificity"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5444872/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 April 2010","displayDocTitle":"Color Constancy Using Natural Image Statistics and Scene Semantics","volume":"33","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/5444872/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2011","accessionNumber":"11832497","pubMedId":"20421672","dateOfInsertion":"17 February 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Color Constancy Using Natural Image Statistics and Scene Semantics","sourcePdf":"ttp2011040687.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.093268S","chronDate":"April  2011","xplore-pub-id":"34","isNumber":"5715914","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"162","xplore-issue":"5715914","articleId":"5444872","onlineDate":"08 April 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5444877,"authors":[{"name":"Wen-Yen Chen","affiliation":["Yahoo, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Wen-Yen","lastName":"Chen","id":"37404846600"},{"name":"Yangqiu Song","affiliation":["Microsoft Research Asia, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yangqiu","lastName":"Song","id":"37407140300"},{"name":"Hongjie Bai","affiliation":["Google Information Technology (China) Company Limited, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Hongjie","lastName":"Bai","id":"37395712600"},{"name":"Chih-Jen Lin","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chih-Jen","lastName":"Lin","id":"37278418100"},{"name":"Edward Y.

By strobing the exposure with unique sequences within the integration time of each frame, we take coded projections of dynamic events. From a sequence of such frames, we reconstruct a high-speed video of the high-frequency periodic process. Strobing is used in entertainment, medical imaging, and industrial inspection to generate lower beat frequencies. But this is limited to scenes with a detectable single dominant frequency and requires high-intensity lighting. In this paper, we address the problem of sub-Nyquist sampling of periodic signals and show designs to capture and reconstruct such signals. The key result is that for such signals, the Nyquist rate constraint can be imposed on the strobe rate rather than the sensor rate. The technique is based on intentional aliasing of the frequency components of the periodic signal while the reconstruction algorithm exploits recent advances in sparse representations and compressive sensing. We exploit the sparsity of periodic signals in the Fourier domain to develop reconstruction algorithms that are inspired by compressive sensing.","doi":"10.1109/TPAMI.2010.87","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel5/34/5715914/05444878.pdf","startPage":"671","endPage":"686","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPAMI.2010.87","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5715914","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Coded Strobing Photography: Compressive Sensing of High Speed Periodic Videos","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5444878","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 April 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5444878/","displayDocTitle":"Coded Strobing Photography: Compressive Sensing of High Speed Periodic Videos","volume":"33","issue":"4","publicationDate":"April 2011","accessionNumber":"11832498","pubMedId":"20421670","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5444878/","dateOfInsertion":"17 February 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Coded Strobing Photography: Compressive Sensing of High Speed Periodic Videos","sourcePdf":"ttp2011040671.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.109633S","chronDate":"April  2011","xplore-pub-id":"34","isNumber":"5715914","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"97","xplore-issue":"5715914","articleId":"5444878","onlineDate":"08 April 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5444879,"authors":[{"name":"Andreas Bulling","affiliation":["Computer Laboratory, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK","School of Computing and Communications, Lancaster University, Lancaster, UK"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/34/5715914/5444879/5444879-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Andreas Bulling received the MSc degree in computer science from the Technical University of Karlsruhe, Germany, in 2006, and the PhD degree in information technology and electrical engineering from the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (ETH) Zurich, Switzerland, in 2010.

We then devise 90 different features based on these characteristics and select a subset of them using minimum redundancy maximum relevance (mRMR) feature selection. We validate the method using an eight participant study in an office environment using an example set of five activity classes: copying a text, reading a printed paper, taking handwritten notes, watching a video, and browsing the Web. We also include periods with no specific activity (the NULL class). Using a support vector machine (SVM) classifier and person-independent (leave-one-person-out) training, we obtain an average precision of 76.1 percent and recall of 70.5 percent over all classes and participants.

DNSSEC applies well-established public key cryptography to ensure data integrity and origin authenticity in the DNS system. While the cryptographic design of DNSSEC is sound and seemingly simple, its development has taken the IETF over a decade and several protocol revisions, and even today its deployment is still in the early stage of rolling out. In this paper, we provide the first systematic examination of the design, deployment, and operational challenges encountered by DNSSEC over the years. Our study reveals a fundamental gap between cryptographic designs and operational Internet systems. To be deployed in the global Internet, a cryptographic protocol must possess several critical properties including scalability, flexibility, incremental deployability, and ability to function in face of imperfect operations. We believe that the insights gained from this study can offer valuable inputs to future cryptographic designs for other Internet-scale systems.","doi":"10.1109/TDSC.2010.10","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Dependable and Secure Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Dependable and Secure Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/8858/5954680/05444890.pdf","startPage":"656","endPage":"669","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TDSC.2010.10","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5954680","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Deploying Cryptography in Internet-Scale Systems: A Case Study on DNSSEC","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5444890","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 April 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.-Oct.  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5444890/","displayDocTitle":"Deploying Cryptography in Internet-Scale Systems: A Case Study on DNSSEC","volume":"8","issue":"5","publicationDate":"Sept.-Oct. 2011","accessionNumber":"12110494","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5444890/","dateOfInsertion":"14 July 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Deploying Cryptography in Internet-Scale Systems: A Case Study on DNSSEC","sourcePdf":"ttq2011050656.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.060584S","chronDate":"Sept.-Oct.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"8858","isNumber":"5954680","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8858","citationCount":"25","xplore-issue":"5954680","articleId":"5444890","onlineDate":"08 April 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5444893,"authors":[{"name":"Radu Horaud","affiliation":["INRIA Grenoble Rh\u00f4ne-Alpes, Montbonnot Saint Martin, France"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/34/5692151/5444893/5444893-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Radu Horaud received the BSc degree in electrical engineering, the MSc degree in control engineering, and the PhD degree in computer science from the Institut National Polytechnique de Grenoble, France.

The problem is recast into a missing data framework where unknown correspondences are handled via mixture models. Adopting a maximum likelihood principle, we introduce an innovative EM-like algorithm, namely, the Expectation Conditional Maximization for Point Registration (ECMPR) algorithm. The algorithm allows the use of general covariance matrices for the mixture model components and improves over the isotropic covariance case. We analyze in detail the associated consequences in terms of estimation of the registration parameters, and propose an optimal method for estimating the rotational and translational parameters based on semidefinite positive relaxation. We extend rigid registration to articulated registration. Robustness is ensured by detecting and rejecting outliers through the addition of a uniform component to the Gaussian mixture model at hand. We provide an in-depth analysis of our method and compare it both theoretically and experimentally with other robust methods for point registration.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPAMI.2010.94","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5692151","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel5/34/5692151/05444893.pdf","endPage":"602","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Rigid and Articulated Point Registration with Expectation Conditional Maximization","doi":"10.1109/TPAMI.2010.94","startPage":"587","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5444893","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 April 2010","displayDocTitle":"Rigid and Articulated Point Registration with Expectation Conditional Maximization","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5444893/","dateOfInsertion":"17 January 2011","accessionNumber":"11759963","pubMedId":"20421669","publicationDate":"March 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5444893/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"33","issue":"3","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Rigid and Articulated Point Registration with Expectation Conditional Maximization","sourcePdf":"ttp2011030587.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.105638S","chronDate":"March  2011","xplore-pub-id":"34","isNumber":"5692151","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"126","xplore-issue":"5692151","articleId":"5444893","onlineDate":"08 April 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-08"},{"_id":5444904,"authors":[{"name":"Lei Chen","affiliation":["College of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei, China"],"firstName":"Lei","lastName":"Chen","id":"37406308400"},{"name":"Yuejin Tang","affiliation":["College of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei, China"],"firstName":"Yuejin","lastName":"Tang","id":"37308774200"},{"name":"Zhi Li","affiliation":["College of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei, China"],"firstName":"Zhi","lastName":"Li","id":"37309813500"},{"name":"Li Ren","affiliation":["College of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei, China"],"firstName":"Li","lastName":"Ren","id":"37302887200"},{"name":"Jing Shi","affiliation":["College of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei, China"],"firstName":"Jing","lastName":"Shi","id":"38247409500"},{"name":"Shijie Cheng","affiliation":["College of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei, China"],"firstName":"Shijie","lastName":"Cheng","id":"37276496800"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1051-8223"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2515"},{"format":"CD","value":"2378-7074"}],"articleNumber":"5444904","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":48,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":506},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"The IEEE Council on Superconductivity","url":"http://www.ewh.ieee.org/tc/csc/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Current limiters","Fault current limiters","Superconducting coils","Switches","Coupling circuits","Impedance","Voltage control","Arresters","Wounds","Switching circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["arresters","circuit breakers","coupled circuits","fault current limiters","superconducting coils"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["current limiting characteristics","flux-coupling type superconducting fault current limiter","superconducting coupling","metal oxide arresters","noninductive coupling characteristics","controlled switch","anti-parallel IGBT pair"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Controlled switch","flux-coupling type SFCL","MOA","non-inductive coupling characteristics"]}],"abstract":"A novel flux-coupling type superconducting fault current limiter (SFCL) is proposed in this paper. This type SFCL is composed of two superconducting coupling coils, a controlled switch and two metal oxide arresters (MOAs). The primary coil and the secondary coil, which are wound in the reverse direction and are respectively in parallel with the two MOAs, are connected in parallel through the controlled switch and a main circuit breaker. Under normal condition, due to the non-inductive coupling characteristics between the two superconducting coils, the impedance of the proposed SFCL will be too small to affect the main circuit. After the fault happens, the controlled switch will be opened from its initial closed state, and meanwhile the MOAs will prevent the two coils from being damaged by the overvoltage caused by the switching operation. Since the flux between the coils cannot cancel out each other, the non-inductive coupling will disappear, and then the limiting impedance will be triggered for current-limitation. In order to evaluate the current-limiting performance of the novel flux-coupling type SFCL, a laboratory scale prototype was made. The two superconducting coils were fabricated with Bi2223/Ag, and an anti-parallel IGBT pair was chosen as the controlled switch. According to the test results, it was found that, the fault current could be limited quickly and effectively, and there was no overvoltage during the operation process of the controlled switch.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Current Limiting Characteristics of a Novel Flux-Coupling Type Superconducting Fault Current Limiter","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Applied Superconductivity","doi":"10.1109/TASC.2010.2044651","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Applied Superconductivity","pdfPath":"/iel5/77/5471713/05444904.pdf","startPage":"1143","endPage":"1146","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TASC.2010.2044651","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5471713","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5444904","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5444904/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 April 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2010","displayDocTitle":"Current Limiting Characteristics of a Novel Flux-Coupling Type Superconducting Fault Current Limiter","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"20","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/5444904/","dateOfInsertion":"24 May 2010","publicationDate":"June 2010","accessionNumber":"11323188","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Current Limiting Characteristics of a Novel Flux-Coupling Type Superconducting Fault Current Limiter","sourcePdf":"tasc-chen-2044651.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.055957S","chronDate":"June  2010","xplore-pub-id":"77","isNumber":"5471713","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"77","citationCount":"48","xplore-issue":"5471713","articleId":"5444904","onlineDate":"08 April 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5444914,"authors":[{"name":"Oytun Turk","affiliation":["Sensory, Inc., Portland, OR, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/10376/5485195/5444914/5444914-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Oytun T\u00fcrk received the B.S. degree, M.S., and Ph.D. degrees in electrical and electronics engineering from Bogazici University, Istanbul, Turkey, in 2000, 2003, and 2007, respectively.","In 2000, he cofounded Sestek A.S., where he worked as a Lead Researcher in commercial voice conversion technology.

This paper investigates voice conversion and modification techniques to reduce database collection and processing efforts while maintaining acceptable quality and naturalness. In a factorial design, we study the relative contributions of voice quality and prosody as well as the amount of distortions introduced by the respective signal manipulation steps. The unit selection engine in our open source and modular text-to-speech (TTS) framework MARY is extended with voice quality transformation using either GMM-based prediction or vocal tract copy resynthesis. These algorithms are then cross-combined with various prosody copy resynthesis methods. The overall expressive speech generation process functions as a postprocessing step on TTS outputs to transform neutral synthetic speech into aggressive, cheerful, or depressed speech. Cross-combinations of voice quality and prosody transformation algorithms are compared in listening tests for perceived expressive style and quality. The results show that there is a tradeoff between identification and naturalness. Combined modeling of both voice quality and prosody leads to the best identification scores at the expense of lowest naturalness ratings. The fine detail of both voice quality and prosody, as preserved by the copy synthesis, did contribute to a better identification as compared to the approximate models.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5444914/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 April 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","publicationDate":"July 2010","accessionNumber":"11392225","htmlLink":"/document/5444914/","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"14 June 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"18","issue":"5","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Evaluation of Expressive Speech Synthesis With Voice Conversion and Copy Resynthesis Techniques","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Evaluation of Expressive Speech Synthesis With Voice Conversion and Copy Resynthesis Techniques","sourcePdf":"18tasl05-oturk-2041113.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.065805S","chronDate":"July  2010","xplore-pub-id":"10376","isNumber":"5485195","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10376","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"5485195","articleId":"5444914","onlineDate":"08 April 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5444944,"authors":[{"name":"Qing Ling","affiliation":["Department of Automation, University of Science and Technology, Hefei, Anhui, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/5484906/5444944/5444944-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Qing Ling received the B.S. degree in automation and the Ph.D. degree in control theory and control engineering from University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, Anhui, in 2001 and 2006, respectively.","From 2006 to 2009, he was a Postdoctoral Research Fellow with the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Michigan Technological University, Houghton.

Capitalizing on the spatial sparsity of localized phenomena, compressive data collection is enforced by turning off a fraction of sensors using a simple random node sleeping strategy, which conserves sensing energy and prolongs network lifetime. In the absence of a fusion center, sparse signal recovery via decentralized in-network processing is developed, based on a consensus optimization formulation and the alternating direction method of multipliers. In the proposed algorithm, each active sensor monitors and recovers its local region only, collaborates with its neighboring active sensors through low-power one-hop communication, and iteratively improves the local estimates until reaching the global optimum. Because each sensor monitors the local region rather than the entire large field, the iterative algorithm converges fast, in addition to being scalable in terms of transmission and computation costs.

This distributed ISAR technique is devised for two different cases: 1) multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) case with each platform carrying an active radar that transmits and receives RF waveforms and 2) multistatic case with a single platform carrying an active radar (transmitting and receiving) and the remaining platforms equipped with passive sensors (namely, receiving only). The processing chain proposed for the distributed ISAR is shown, together with the results obtained against simulated ISAR data for both the MIMO and the multistatic cases. The performance analysis shows that the proposed technique is able to provide an increase of the cross-range resolution up to the number of platforms in the multistatic case and even higher in the MIMO case, if the platforms are properly located. This is of great benefit in applications where the target rotation angle is insufficient to guarantee the desired resolution. A typical case is the imaging of ship targets with rotation induced by the sea swell structure under low sea state conditions. To make the results appealing for practical application, the performance degradation is also analyzed arising from errors in the knowledge of both the target rotation motion and the acquisition geometry.

Multiangle image registration poses two main challenges: 1) Images captured at large view angles are susceptible to resolution change and blurring, and 2) local geometric distortion caused by topographic effects and/or platform instability may be important. In this paper, we propose a two-step nonrigid automatic registration scheme for multiangle satellite images. In the first step, control points (CPs) are selected in a preregistration process based on the scale-invariant feature transform (SIFT). However, the number of CPs obtained in this first step may be too few and/or CPs may be unevenly distributed. To remediate these problems, in a second step, the preliminary registered image is subdivided into chips of 64 \u00d7 64 pixels, and each chip is matched with a corresponding chip in the reference image using normalized cross correlation (NCC). By doing so, more CPs with better spatial distribution are obtained. Two criteria are applied during the generation of CPs to identify outliers. Selected SIFT and NCC CPs are used for defining a nonrigid thin-plate-spline model. The proposed registration scheme has been tested using data from the Compact High Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (CHRIS) onboard the Project for On-Board Autonomy (Proba) satellite. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method works well in areas with little variation in topography. Application in areas with more pronounced relief would require the use of orthorectified image data in order to achieve subpixel registration accuracy.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fully Automatic Subpixel Image Registration of Multiangle CHRIS/Proba Data","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","doi":"10.1109/TGRS.2010.2042813","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel5/36/5487390/05444984.pdf","startPage":"2829","endPage":"2839","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2010.2042813","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5487390","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5444984","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5444984/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 April 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2010","displayDocTitle":"Fully Automatic Subpixel Image Registration of Multiangle CHRIS/Proba Data","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"48","issue":"7","htmlLink":"/document/5444984/","dateOfInsertion":"17 June 2010","publicationDate":"July 2010","accessionNumber":"11442174","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fully Automatic Subpixel Image Registration of Multiangle CHRIS/Proba Data","sourcePdf":"tgrs-ma-2042813.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.097676S","chronDate":"July  2010","xplore-pub-id":"36","isNumber":"5487390","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"55","xplore-issue":"5487390","articleId":"5444984","onlineDate":"08 April 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5444990,"authors":[{"name":"Ashraf Ahmed","affiliation":["School of Engineering and Computing Sciences, Science Laboratories, Durham University, Durham, UK"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/60/5635301/5444990/5444990-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Ashraf Ahmed (S'09) received the B.Sc. degree from Assiut University, Assiut, Egypt, in 1999, and the M.Sc. degree from Cairo University, Cairo, Egypt, in 2005, both in electrical engineering.

Small-scale VAWTs are attractive due to their ability to capture wind from different directions without using yaw; this simplifies the design and gives the turbine tolerance to turbulence in urban areas. One difficulty with VAWTs is to prevent overspeeding and component overloading at excessive wind velocities. This paper suggests that necessary control can be achieved by controlling the electric power in order to operate the turbine in the stall region. This control strategy attenuates the stress in the system, while smoothing the power generated. It is shown that the controller can stabilize the nonlinear system using an adaptive current feedback loop. The controller does not need wind velocity or turbine speed, but is based on the current and voltage measured on the dc side of the rectifier connected to the permanent magnet synchronous generator. Maximum power point tracking (MPPT) control is provided in normal operation. Simulation and experimental results are presented.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Geoscience"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5444990/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 April 2010","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11653664","volume":"25","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/5444990/","publicationDate":"Dec. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"New Constant Electrical Power Soft-Stalling Control for Small-Scale VAWTs","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"New Constant Electrical Power Soft-Stalling Control for Small-Scale VAWTs","sourcePdf":"tec-ahmed-2043737-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.070135S","chronDate":"Dec.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"60","isNumber":"5635301","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"60","citationCount":"44","xplore-issue":"5635301","articleId":"5444990","onlineDate":"08 April 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5444991,"authors":[{"name":"Maiying Zhong","affiliation":["Department of Inertia Technology and Navigation Guidance Instrument, Beihang University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Maiying","lastName":"Zhong","id":"37288366600"},{"name":"Steven X Ding","affiliation":["University of Duisburg-Essen, Duisburg, Germany"],"firstName":"Steven X","lastName":"Ding","id":"37287881000"},{"name":"Qing-Long Han","affiliation":["School of Computing Sciences, Central Queensland University, Rockhampton, QLD, Australia"],"firstName":"Qing-Long","lastName":"Han","id":"37274962400"},{"name":"Qiang Ding","affiliation":["School of Control Science and Engineering, Shandong University, Jinan, China"],"firstName":"Qiang","lastName":"Ding","id":"37410394000"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9286"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2523"},{"format":"CD","value":"2334-3303"}],"articleNumber":"5444991","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":51,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":869},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Control Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieeecss.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Time varying systems","Fault detection","Sufficient conditions","Phase frequency detector","Control systems","Fault diagnosis","Length measurement","Books","Design optimization","Filtering"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["discrete time systems","fault diagnosis","linear systems","time-varying systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["parity space","fault estimation","linear systems","discrete time-varying system","matrix quadratic form","maximum singular value","Frobenius norm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Fault estimation","linear time-varying system","matrix quadratic form","parity space"]}],"abstract":"This note is concerned with the problem of parity space-based fault estimation for linear discrete time-varying systems.

Here, we show that muscle reflexes could be vital to link these two observations. We develop a model of human locomotion that is controlled by muscle reflexes which encode principles of legged mechanics. Equipped with this reflex control, we find this model to stabilize into a walking gait from its dynamic interplay with the ground, reproduce human walking dynamics and leg kinematics, tolerate ground disturbances, and adapt to slopes without parameter interventions. In addition, we find this model to predict some individual muscle activation patterns known from walking experiments. The results suggest not only that the interplay between mechanics and motor control is essential to human locomotion, but also that human motor output could for some muscles be dominated by neural circuits that encode principles of legged mechanics.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5445011/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 April 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2010","volume":"18","issue":"3","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11442078","pubMedId":"20378480","dateOfInsertion":"07 June 2010","publicationDate":"June 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5445011/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A Muscle-Reflex Model That Encodes Principles of Legged Mechanics Produces Human Walking Dynamics and Muscle Activities","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Muscle-Reflex Model That Encodes Principles of Legged Mechanics Produces Human Walking Dynamics and Muscle Activities","sourcePdf":"tnsre-geyer-2047592.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.151088S","chronDate":"June  2010","xplore-pub-id":"7333","isNumber":"5482410","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7333","citationCount":"338","xplore-issue":"5482410","articleId":"5445011","onlineDate":"08 April 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-23"},{"_id":5445015,"authors":[{"name":"Lauri Connelly","affiliation":["Rehabilitation Institute of Chicago, Chicago, IL, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Lauri Connelly received the B.A. degree in psychology from the Illinois Wesleyan University, Bloomington, IL, in 1992, and the M.S. degree in occupational therapy from Rush University, Chicago, IL, in 2000.","She is currently a Clinical Research Coordinator in the Center for Rehabilitation Outcomes Research at the Rehabilitation Institute of Chicago."]},"firstName":"Lauri","lastName":"Connelly","id":"37394079500"},{"name":"Yicheng Jia","affiliation":["Rehabilitation Institute of Chicago, Chicago, IL, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Yicheng Jia received the B.E. degree in mechanical engineering from Jimei University, Xiamen, China, in 1996, and the M.S. degree in mechanical engineering from Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, in 2000.","He has worked as a software engineer for GE Healthcare and Ageia Technology.

Thus, a novel glove was developed which can provide independent extension assistance to each digit while still allowing full arm movement. This pneumatic glove, the PneuGlove, can be used for training grasp-and-release movements either with real objects or with virtual objects in a virtual reality environment. Two groups of stroke survivors, with seven subjects in each group, completed a six-week rehabilitation training protocol, consisting of three 1-h sessions held each week. One group wore the PneuGlove during training, performed both within a novel virtual reality environment and outside of it with physical objects, while the other group completed the same training without the device. Across subjects, significant improvements were observed in the Fugl-Meyer Assessment for the upper extremity ( p<;;0.001), the hand/wrist portion of the Fugl-Meyer Assessment ( p<;;0.001), the Box and Blocks test ( p<;;0.05), and palmar pinch strength ( p<;;0.05).

A comparative study of voice conversion using an ANN model and the state-of-the-art Gaussian mixture model (GMM) is conducted. The results of voice conversion, evaluated using subjective and objective measures, confirm that an ANN-based VC system performs as good as that of a GMM-based VC system, and the quality of the transformed speech is intelligible and possesses the characteristics of a target speaker. In this paper, we also address the issue of dependency of voice conversion techniques on parallel data between the source and the target speakers. While there have been efforts to use nonparallel data and speaker adaptation techniques, it is important to investigate techniques which capture speaker-specific characteristics of a target speaker, and avoid any need for source speaker's data either for training or for adaptation. In this paper, we propose a voice conversion approach using an ANN model to capture speaker-specific characteristics of a target speaker and demonstrate that such a voice conversion approach can perform monolingual as well as cross-lingual voice conversion of an arbitrary source speaker.","doi":"10.1109/TASL.2010.2047683","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/10376/5485195/05445041.pdf","startPage":"954","endPage":"964","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TASL.2010.2047683","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5485195","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Spectral Mapping Using Artificial Neural Networks for Voice Conversion","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5445041","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 April 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5445041/","displayDocTitle":"Spectral Mapping Using Artificial Neural Networks for Voice Conversion","volume":"18","issue":"5","publicationDate":"July 2010","accessionNumber":"11392226","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5445041/","dateOfInsertion":"14 June 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spectral Mapping Using Artificial Neural Networks for Voice Conversion","sourcePdf":"tasl-prahallad-2047683.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.076027S","chronDate":"July  2010","xplore-pub-id":"10376","isNumber":"5485195","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10376","citationCount":"137","xplore-issue":"5485195","articleId":"5445041","onlineDate":"08 April 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5445044,"authors":[{"name":"Shefeng Yan","affiliation":["Institute of Acoustics, Chinese Academy and Sciences, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/10376/5609232/5445044/5445044-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Shefeng Yan (M'05\u2013SM'10) received the B.Sc., M.Sc., and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi'an, China, in 1999, 2001, and 2005, respectively.","He was a Postdoctoral Research Associate with the Institute of Acoustics, Chinese Academy of Sciences (IACAS), Beijing, China, from 2005 to 2007, and with the Department of Electronics and Telecommunications, Norwegian University of Science and Technology, Trondheim, from 2007 to 2009, respectively.

The array processing problem in the spherical harmonics domain is expressed with a matrix formulation. The beamformer weight vector design problem is written as a multiply constrained problem, so that the resulting beamformer can provide a suitable trade-off among multiple conflicting performance measures such as directivity index, robustness, array gain, sidelobe level, mainlobe width, and so on. The multiply constrained problem is formulated as a convex form of second-order cone programming which is computationally tractable. We show that the pure phase-mode spherical microphone array can be viewed as a minimum variance distortionless response (MVDR) beamformer in the spherical harmonics domain for the case of spherically isotropic noise. It is shown that our approach includes the delay-and-sum beamformer and a pure phase-mode beamformer as special cases, which leads to very flexible designs. Results of simulations and experimental data processing show good performance of the proposed array pattern synthesis approach. To simplify the analysis, the assumption of equidistant spatial sampling of the wavefield by microphones on a spherical surface is used and the aliasing effects due to noncontinuous spatial sampling are neglected.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TASL.2010.2047815","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5609232","startPage":"361","endPage":"371","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/10376/5609232/05445044.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal Modal Beamforming for Spherical Microphone Arrays","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5445044/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 April 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5445044/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Optimal Modal Beamforming for Spherical Microphone Arrays","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2011","accessionNumber":"11597477","dateOfInsertion":"25 October 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"19","issue":"2","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal Modal Beamforming for Spherical Microphone Arrays","sourcePdf":"18tasl07-syan-2047815-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.080684S","chronDate":"Feb.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"10376","isNumber":"5609232","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10376","citationCount":"88","xplore-issue":"5609232","articleId":"5445044","onlineDate":"08 April 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5445045,"authors":[{"name":"Hussein Atoui","affiliation":["Department of Methodologies of Information Processing in Cardiology, Institut National des Sciences Appliqu\u00e9es (INSA-Lyon), Institut National de la Sant\u00e9 et de la Recherche M\u00e9dicale (INSERM), Universit\u00e9 Lyon 1, Bron, France"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4233/5475408/5445045/5445045-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Hussein Atoui received the B.S. degree in computer science from Lebanese University, Beirut, Lebanon, in 2001, and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in informatics from the Institut National des Sciences Appliqu\u00e9es de Lyon (INSA-Lyon), Lyon, France, in 2002 and 2006, respectively.","From 2002 to 2008, he has been with the M\u00e9thodologies de Traitement de l'Information en Cardiologie (MTIC) Research Laboratory of INSA-Lyon and Universit\u00e9 Lyon 1, Lyon.

This paper presents and assesses a novel approach for deriving 12-lead ECGs from a pseudoorthogonal three-lead subset via generic and patient-specific nonlinear reconstruction methods based on the use of artificial neural-networks (ANNs) committees. We train and test the ANN on a set of serial ECGs from 120 cardiac inpatients from the intensive care unit of the Cardiology Hospital of Lyon. We then assess the similarity between the synthesized ECGs and the original ECGs at the quantitative level in comparison with generic and patient-specific multiple-regression-based methods. The ANN achieved accurate reconstruction of the 12-lead ECGs of the study population using both generic and patient-specific ANN transforms, showing significant improvements over generic (\n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">p</i>\n -value \u00bf 0.05) and patient-specific ( \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">p</i>\n-value \u00bf 0.01) multiple-linear-regression-based models.

Gaussian mixture model (GMM)-based conversion is commonly used, but it is subject to overfitting. In this paper, we propose to use partial least squares (PLS)-based transforms in voice conversion. To prevent overfitting, the degrees of freedom in the mapping can be controlled by choosing a suitable number of components. We propose a technique to combine PLS with GMMs, enabling the use of multiple local linear mappings. To further improve the perceptual quality of the mapping where rapid transitions between GMM components produce audible artefacts, we propose to low-pass filter the component posterior probabilities. The conducted experiments show that the proposed technique results in better subjective and objective quality than the baseline joint density GMM approach. In speech quality conversion preference tests, the proposed method achieved 67% preference score against the smoothed joint density GMM method and 84% preference score against the unsmoothed joint density GMM method. In objective tests the proposed method produced a lower Mel-cepstral distortion than the reference methods.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Voice Conversion Using Partial Least Squares Regression","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","doi":"10.1109/TASL.2010.2041699","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/10376/5485195/05445056.pdf","startPage":"912","endPage":"921","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TASL.2010.2041699","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5485195","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5445056","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5445056/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 April 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2010","displayDocTitle":"Voice Conversion Using Partial Least Squares Regression","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"18","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/5445056/","dateOfInsertion":"14 June 2010","publicationDate":"July 2010","accessionNumber":"11392231","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Voice Conversion Using Partial Least Squares Regression","sourcePdf":"tasl-helander-2041699.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.091766S","chronDate":"July  2010","xplore-pub-id":"10376","isNumber":"5485195","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10376","citationCount":"114","xplore-issue":"5485195","articleId":"5445056","onlineDate":"08 April 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5445065,"authors":[{"name":"Lei Tang","affiliation":["Arizona State University, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Lei Tang is a doctoral candidate in computer science and engineering at Arizona State University.

These schemes have been evaluated for a number of hardware platforms, in particular, single-precision GPUs as accelerators to the general purpose CPU. This paper reevaluates the situation with new mixed precision solvers that run entirely on the GPU: We demonstrate that mixed precision schemes constitute a significant performance gain over native double precision. Moreover, we present a new implementation of cyclic reduction for the parallel solution of tridiagonal systems and employ this scheme as a line relaxation smoother in our GPU-based multigrid solver. With an alternating direction implicit variant of this advanced smoother, we can extend the applicability of the GPU multigrid solvers to very ill-conditioned systems arising from the discretization on anisotropic meshes, that previously had to be solved on the CPU. The resulting mixed-precision schemes are always faster than double precision alone, and outperform tuned CPU solvers consistently by almost an order of magnitude.","doi":"10.1109/TPDS.2010.61","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/71/5644739/05445081.pdf","startPage":"22","endPage":"32","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPDS.2010.61","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5644739","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cyclic Reduction Tridiagonal Solvers on GPUs Applied to Mixed-Precision Multigrid","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5445081","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 April 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5445081/","displayDocTitle":"Cyclic Reduction Tridiagonal Solvers on GPUs Applied to Mixed-Precision Multigrid","volume":"22","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2011","accessionNumber":"11670137","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"29 November 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cyclic Reduction Tridiagonal Solvers on GPUs Applied to Mixed-Precision Multigrid","sourcePdf":"ttd2011010022.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.055518S","chronDate":"Jan.  2011","isNumber":"5644739","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"71","citationCount":"62","articleId":"5445081","onlineDate":"08 April 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5445086,"authors":[{"name":"Gabriel Falcao","affiliation":["Instituto de Telecomunica\u00e7\u00f5es and the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Coimbra, Coimbra, Portugal"],"firstName":"Gabriel","lastName":"Falcao","id":"37394052900"},{"name":"Leonel Sousa","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Instituto Superior T\u00e9cnico, Technical University of Lisbon, INESC-ID Lisboa, Lisboa, Portugal"],"firstName":"Leonel","lastName":"Sousa","id":"37265872100"},{"name":"Vitor Silva","affiliation":["Instituto de Telecomunica\u00e7\u00f5es and the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Coimbra, Coimbra, Portugal"],"firstName":"Vitor","lastName":"Silva","id":"37287128100"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1045-9219"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2183"},{"format":"CD","value":"2161-9883"}],"articleNumber":"5445086","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":72,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":1780},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computer Society","url":"http://www.computer.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Parity check codes","Decoding","Multicore processing","Throughput","Computer architecture","Very large scale integration","Data structures","Parallel processing","Parallel algorithms","Graphics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer graphic equipment","coprocessors","multiprocessing systems","parallel algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["low-density parity-check code","multicore architectures","software-based LDPC decoders","parallel algorithms","x86 processors","graphics processing units","Cell broadband engine"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["LDPC","data-parallel computing","multicore","graphics processing units","GPU","CUDA","CELL","OpenMP."]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5445086","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/71/5676134/05445086.pdf","startPage":"309","endPage":"322","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPDS.2010.66","doi":"10.1109/TPDS.2010.66","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5676134","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Massively LDPC Decoding on Multicore Architectures","abstract":"Unlike usual VLSI approaches necessary for the computation of intensive Low-Density Parity-Check (LDPC) code decoders, this paper presents flexible software-based LDPC decoders. Algorithms and data structures suitable for parallel computing are proposed in this paper to perform LDPC decoding on multicore architectures. To evaluate the efficiency of the proposed parallel algorithms, LDPC decoders were developed on recent multicores, such as off-the-shelf general-purpose x86 processors, Graphics Processing Units (GPUs), and the CELL Broadband Engine (CELL/B.E.). Challenging restrictions, such as memory access conflicts, latency, coalescence, or unknown behavior of thread and block schedulers, were unraveled and worked out. Experimental results for different code lengths show throughputs in the order of 1 ~ 2 Mbps on the general-purpose multicores, and ranging from 40 Mbps on the GPU to nearly 70 Mbps on the CELL/B.E. The analysis of the obtained results allows to conclude that the CELL/B.E. performs better for short to medium length codes, while the GPU achieves superior throughputs with larger codes. They achieve throughputs that in some cases approach very well those obtained with VLSI decoders. From the analysis of the results, we can predict a throughput increase with the rise of the number of cores.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5445086/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 April 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2011","volume":"22","issue":"2","accessionNumber":"11704459","dateOfInsertion":"23 December 2010","publicationDate":"Feb. 2011","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Massively LDPC Decoding on Multicore Architectures","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Massively LDPC Decoding on Multicore Architectures","sourcePdf":"ttd2011020309.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.048047S","chronDate":"Feb.  2011","isNumber":"5676134","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"71","citationCount":"72","articleId":"5445086","onlineDate":"08 April 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5445087,"authors":[{"name":"Esam El-Araby","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, George Washington University, Ashburn, VA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/71/5644739/5445087/5445087-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Esam El-Araby received the BSc degree in electronics and telecommunication engineering and a higher diploma in automatic control and computer engineering from Assiut University, Egypt, in 1991 and 1997, respectively.

Their acceptance, however, has been hindered by productivity challenges arising from increased design complexity, a wide array of custom design languages and tools, and often overblown sales literature. This paper presents a review and taxonomy of High-Level Languages (HLLs) and a framework for the comparative analysis of their features. It also introduces new metrics and a model based on computational effort. The proposed concepts are inspired by Netwon's equations of motion and the notion of work and power in an abstract multidimensional space of design specifications. The metrics are devised to highlight two aspects of the design process: the total time-to-solution and the efficient utilization of user and computing resources at discrete time steps along the development path. The study involves analytical and experimental evaluations demonstrating the applicability of the proposed model.","doi":"10.1109/TPDS.2010.67","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/71/5644739/05445087.pdf","startPage":"33","endPage":"45","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPDS.2010.67","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5644739","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Framework for Evaluating High-Level Design Methodologies for High-Performance Reconfigurable Computers","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5445087","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 April 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5445087/","displayDocTitle":"A Framework for Evaluating High-Level Design Methodologies for High-Performance Reconfigurable Computers","volume":"22","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2011","accessionNumber":"11670135","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5445087/","dateOfInsertion":"29 November 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Framework for Evaluating High-Level Design Methodologies for High-Performance Reconfigurable Computers","sourcePdf":"ttd2011010033.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.084183S","chronDate":"Jan.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"71","isNumber":"5644739","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"71","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"5644739","articleId":"5445087","onlineDate":"08 April 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5445094,"authors":[{"name":"Wei-keng Liao","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Northwestern University, Evanston, IL, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/71/5676134/5445094/5445094-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Wei-keng Liao is a research associate professor in the Electrical Engineering and Computer Science Department at Northwestern University.

Its implementation commonly uses a two-phase I/O strategy that partitions a file into disjoint file domains, assigns each domain to a unique process, redistributes the I/O data based on their locations in the domains, and has each process perform I/O for the assigned domain. The partitioning quality determines the maximal performance achievable by the underlying file system, as the shared-file I/O has long been impeded by the cost of file system's data consistency control, particularly due to the conflicted locks. This paper proposes a few file domain partitioning methods designed to reduce lock conflicts under the extent-based file locking protocol. Experiments from four I/O benchmarks on the IBM GPFS and Lustre parallel file systems show that the partitioning method producing minimum lock conflicts wins the highest performance. The benefit of removing conflicted locks can be so significant that more than thirty times of write bandwidth differences are observed between the best and worst methods.","doi":"10.1109/TPDS.2010.74","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/71/5676134/05445094.pdf","startPage":"260","endPage":"272","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPDS.2010.74","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5676134","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design and Evaluation of MPI File Domain Partitioning Methods under Extent-Based File Locking Protocol","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5445094/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 April 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2011","displayDocTitle":"Design and Evaluation of MPI File Domain Partitioning Methods under Extent-Based File Locking Protocol","volume":"22","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2011","accessionNumber":"11704461","htmlLink":"/document/5445094/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"23 December 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design and Evaluation of MPI File Domain Partitioning Methods under Extent-Based File Locking Protocol","sourcePdf":"ttd2011020260.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.078936S","chronDate":"Feb.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"71","isNumber":"5676134","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"71","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"5676134","articleId":"5445094","onlineDate":"08 April 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5445165,"authors":[{"name":"Arutyun I.

These storage clouds let anyone with a credit card purchase storage capacity online, paying a monthly fee for the storage they use.

These are liable to induce errors and/or missing packets on the received data. Therefore the recovering of missing samples for biomedical signals is of great interest. This paper proposes a reconstruction method for ECG signals which is a combination of a left-sided and right-sided autoregressive (AR) model, and the well-known Gerchberg-Papoulis (GP) method. The proposed interpolation algorithm takes into account the samples before and after the missing ones to estimate a forward and a backward AR model. These estimates are used as an initialization of the original GP method. Results show that this interpolation method represents a really suitable technique to ECG reconstruction in a possible corrupted transmission.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE

proposes a computer aided system that aims to recognize frustration/mental fatigue in a student/individual and thereby be able to predict the student's learning/cognition ability. The objective is to recognize the existence of frustration based on the subjects ECG data. Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) is applied on an individual's ECG data as well as on the Heart Rate Variability (HRV) to extract features such as standard deviation, median, entropy and energy. In this experiment, a mental workload is given to 4 subjects who are subjected to a series of test which targets the cognitive ability of the individual. Based on the analysis of the ECG collected efforts are focused towards assessing the existence of the frustration/mental fatigue and its correlation with subject's cognition ability. The results of the two methods applied in this paper show that it is possible to distinguish between an ECG sample when the individual is calm and an ECG sample when the individual is frustrated.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Frustration Detection with Electrocardiograph Signal Using Wavelet Transform","publicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Biosciences","doi":"10.1109/BioSciencesWorld.2010.19","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Biosciences","pdfPath":"/iel5/5445538/5445551/05445563.pdf","startPage":"91","endPage":"94","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/BioSciencesWorld.2010.19","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5445551","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5445563","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5445563/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-13 March 2010","displayDocTitle":"Frustration Detection with Electrocardiograph Signal Using Wavelet Transform","conferenceDate":"7-13 March 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5445563/","dateOfInsertion":"12 April 2010","publicationDate":"March 2010","accessionNumber":"11242653","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Frustration Detection with Electrocardiograph Signal Using Wavelet Transform","confLoc":"Cancun, Mexico","sourcePdf":"3968a091.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.090836S","chronDate":"7-13 March 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5445538","isNumber":"5445551","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5445538","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"5445551","articleId":"5445563","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5445588,"authors":[{"name":"Zahra Haddad Derafshi","affiliation":["Microelectronic & Microsensor Laboratory, University of Tabriz, Tabriz, Iran"],"firstName":"Zahra Haddad","lastName":"Derafshi","id":"37393606900"},{"name":"Hamed Taghipour","affiliation":["Islamic Azad University, Ilkhchi, Iran"],"firstName":"Hamed","lastName":"Taghipour","id":"37393608300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6080-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6079-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5445588","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":276},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Field programmable gate arrays","Wireless communication","MIMO","Signal processing algorithms","Application software","Colored noise","Clocks","Iterative algorithms","Filters","Covariance matrix"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","MIMO communication","radio receivers","signal processing","white noise"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FPGA","noise whitening algorithm","wireless MIMO communication systems","multi-input multi-output techniques","colored noise","hardware implementation","Virtex-4 LX25"]}],"abstract":"Multi-input multi-output (MIMO)techniques are of significant research interest due to their capability to dramatically increase the data rate achievable over a wireless channel without requiring additional transmit power or bandwidth.

Both models developed gave similar result with models developed using fuzzy logic approach performed slightly better compared to feed-forward artificial neural network model.","doi":"10.1109/ICCEA.2010.217","pdfPath":"/iel5/5445539/5445587/05445667.pdf","startPage":"340","endPage":"343","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 Second International Conference on Computer Engineering and Applications","publicationTitle":"2010 Second International Conference on Computer Engineering and Applications","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCEA.2010.217","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5445587","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Comparison between Neural Network Based and Fuzzy Logic Models for Chlorophll-a Estimation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5445667/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-21 March 2010","displayDocTitle":"A Comparison between Neural Network Based and Fuzzy Logic Models for Chlorophll-a Estimation","isConference":true,"volume":"2","dateOfInsertion":"12 April 2010","accessionNumber":"11242733","publicationDate":"March 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5445667/","conferenceDate":"19-21 March 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Comparison between Neural Network Based and Fuzzy Logic Models for Chlorophll-a Estimation","confLoc":"Bali, Indonesia","sourcePdf":"3982b340.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068835S","chronDate":"19-21 March 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5445539","isNumber":"5445587","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5445539","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5445587","articleId":"5445667","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5445695,"authors":[{"name":"Hassan Mathkour","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, College of Computer & Information Sciences, King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia"],"firstName":"Hassan","lastName":"Mathkour","id":"37353020200"},{"name":"Muneer Ahmad","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, College of Computer & Information Sciences, King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia"],"firstName":"Muneer","lastName":"Ahmad","id":"37392642200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6080-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6079-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5445695","dbTime":"19 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":202},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Proteins","Artificial neural networks","Bioinformatics","Sequences","Genomics","DNA","Peptides","Engines","Drugs","Biotechnology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biology computing","DNA","genomics","Java","molecular biophysics","molecular configurations","neural nets","proteins"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["protein structure prediction","artificial neural network","tri-nucleotide base patterns","DNA strands","peptide regions","genomic sequences","transcription engine","raw data purification","Java object oriented neural network","segmented data","sigmoid layers"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["JOONE","hidden layers","sigmoid","transcription","peptide","data filters"]}],"abstract":"Protein prediction is a fundamental problem in Bioinformatics. Protein structure prediction has vital importance in drug design and biotechnology. Huge amount of biological importance data is being produced and there is great need to transcribe the DNA sequences into amino acid sequences because peptide functions perform important role in body functions of species. Exponential growth of genomic data and complex structure of protein make it challenging to predict its structure. In this paper, we are proposing an integrated approach for the prediction of tri-nucleotide base patterns in DNA strands leading to transcription of peptide regions in genomic sequences. The approach comprise of preprocessing of data, transcription engine and post processing of output. The task has been carried out using series of filters that purify the raw data and assign weights to bases for further feeding to central engine. JOONE (Java Object Oriented Neural network) takes input in the form of segmented data and assign to processes at sigmoid layers. Each layer contains processes and feed forward and back propagation techniques make it possible to predict the sample pattern from genomic sequences of variant sizes.","doi":"10.1109/ICCEA.2010.243","publicationTitle":"2010 Second International Conference on Computer Engineering and Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 Second International Conference on Computer Engineering and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5445539/5445587/05445695.pdf","startPage":"484","endPage":"488","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCEA.2010.243","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5445587","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Integrated Approach for Protein Structure Prediction Using Artificial Neural Network","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5445695","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-21 March 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5445695/","displayDocTitle":"An Integrated Approach for Protein Structure Prediction Using Artificial Neural Network","volume":"2","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"March 2010","accessionNumber":"11242760","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5445695/","conferenceDate":"19-21 March 2010","dateOfInsertion":"12 April 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Integrated Approach for Protein Structure Prediction Using Artificial Neural Network","confLoc":"Bali, Indonesia","sourcePdf":"3982b484.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.078872S","chronDate":"19-21 March 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5445539","isNumber":"5445587","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5445539","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"5445587","articleId":"5445695","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5445763,"authors":[{"name":"Ali Jafari","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Member of Scientific Society of Islamic Azad University, Bushehr, Iran"],"firstName":"Ali","lastName":"Jafari","id":"37087068510"},{"name":"Maryam Zekri","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Isfahan University of Technology, Isfahan, Iran"],"firstName":"Maryam","lastName":"Zekri","id":"37397762800"},{"name":"Saeed Sadri","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Isfahan University of Technology, Isfahan, Iran"],"firstName":"Saeed","lastName":"Sadri","id":"37392004600"},{"name":"Alireza Mallahzadeh","affiliation":["Dept. of Electr.

For 8-bit symbol memory system, the code has the coding gain of 1.8 dB and the bandwidth of 1.07 Gbps when operated at 290 MHz with the power consumption of 26.4 mW.","doi":"10.1109/ICCEA.2010.63","publicationTitle":"2010 Second International Conference on Computer Engineering and Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 Second International Conference on Computer Engineering and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5445539/5445634/05445821.pdf","startPage":"281","endPage":"285","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCEA.2010.63","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5445634","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Product Reed-Solomon Codes for Implementing NAND Flash Controller on FPGA Chip","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"19-21 March 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5445821/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-21 March 2010","displayDocTitle":"Product Reed-Solomon Codes for Implementing NAND Flash Controller on FPGA Chip","dateOfInsertion":"12 April 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5445821/","accessionNumber":"11242877","volume":"1","publicationDate":"March 2010","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Product Reed-Solomon Codes for Implementing NAND Flash Controller on FPGA Chip","confLoc":"Bali, Indonesia","sourcePdf":"3982a281.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.114632S","chronDate":"19-21 March 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5445539","isNumber":"5445634","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5445539","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"5445634","articleId":"5445821","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5445837,"authors":[{"name":"Azlee Zabidi","affiliation":["Faculty of Electrical Engineering, University Technology Mara, Shah Alam, Selangor Darul Ehsan, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Azlee","lastName":"Zabidi","id":"37320486000"},{"name":"Lee Yoot Khuan","affiliation":["Faculty of Electrical Engineering, University Technology Mara, Shah Alam, Selangor Darul Ehsan, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Lee Yoot","lastName":"Khuan","id":"37322416600"},{"name":"Wahidah Mansor","affiliation":["Faculty of Electrical Engineering, University Technology Mara, Shah Alam, Selangor Darul Ehsan, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Wahidah","lastName":"Mansor","id":"37320486300"},{"name":"Ihsan Mohd Yassin","affiliation":["Faculty of Electrical Engineering, University Technology Mara, Shah Alam, Selangor Darul Ehsan, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Ihsan Mohd","lastName":"Yassin","id":"38286220000"},{"name":"Rohilah Sahak","affiliation":["Faculty of Electrical Engineering, University Technology Mara, Shah Alam, Selangor Darul Ehsan, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Rohilah","lastName":"Sahak","id":"37320487600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6080-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6079-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5445837","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":16,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":328},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Asphyxia","Multilayer perceptrons","Neural networks","Multi-layer neural network","Pediatrics","Artificial neural networks","Cepstral analysis","Filter bank","Pattern recognition","Performance analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["acoustic signal processing","feature extraction","least squares approximations","medical computing","multilayer perceptrons","neurophysiology","pattern classification"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["asphyxia","infant cry signals","neurological level disturbance","pattern classifier","artificial neural network","multilayer perceptron classifier","MLP","feature reduction algorithm","orthogonal lest square analysis","mel frequency cepstrum analysis","feature extraction"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Asphyxia","Mel Frequency Cepstrum Coefficient (MFCC)","Artificial Neural Network(ANN)","Multilayer Perceptron(MLP)","Orthogonal Least Square(OLS)"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5445837","abstract":"Asphyxia occurs in infants with neurological level disturbance, which is found to affect sound of cry produced by infants. The infant cry signals with asphyxia have distinct patterns which can be recognized with pattern classifiers such as Artificial Neural Network (ANN). This study investigates the performance of the Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) classifier in discriminating between healthy and infants with asphyxia from their cries, of ages from zero to seven months old, with an input feature reduction algorithm, Orthogonal Lest Square (OLS) analysis, in contrast to direct selection. The infant cry waveform served as input to Mel Frequency Cepstrum (MFC) analysis for feature extraction. The MLP classifier performance was examined with different combination in number of coefficients, filter bank and hidden nodes. It is found that the OLS algorithm is effective in enhancing the accuracy of MLP classifier while reducing the computation load. Both the average and highest MLP classification accuracies with coefficients being ranked by OLS algorithm have consistently displayed better score than those by direct selection. The highest MLP classification accuracy of 94% is obtained with 40 filter banks, 12 highly ranked MFC coefficients and 15 hidden nodes.","doi":"10.1109/ICCEA.2010.47","startPage":"204","endPage":"208","publicationTitle":"2010 Second International Conference on Computer Engineering and Applications","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCEA.2010.47","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5445634","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 Second International Conference on Computer Engineering and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5445539/5445634/05445837.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Classification of Infant Cries with Asphyxia Using Multilayer Perceptron Neural Network","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5445837/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Classification of Infant Cries with Asphyxia Using Multilayer Perceptron Neural Network","isConference":true,"volume":"1","htmlLink":"/document/5445837/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11242893","publicationDate":"March 2010","dateOfInsertion":"12 April 2010","conferenceDate":"19-21 March 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-21 March 2010","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Classification of Infant Cries with Asphyxia Using Multilayer Perceptron Neural Network","confLoc":"Bali, Indonesia","sourcePdf":"3982a204.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057694S","chronDate":"19-21 March 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5445539","isNumber":"5445634","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5445539","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"5445634","articleId":"5445837","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-03"},{"_id":5445876,"authors":[{"name":"Hameed Hussain","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, COMSATS Institute of Information Technology, Islamabad, Pakistan"],"firstName":"Hameed","lastName":"Hussain","id":"37411413100"},{"name":"Maqbool Uddin Shaikh","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, COMSATS Institute of Information Technology, Islamabad, Pakistan"],"firstName":"Maqbool Uddin","lastName":"Shaikh","id":"37282309400"},{"name":"Saif Ur Rehman Malik","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, COMSATS Institute of Information Technology, Islamabad, Pakistan"],"firstName":"Saif Ur Rehman","lastName":"Malik","id":"37392625000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6080-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6079-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5445876","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":140},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5445876","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Text mining","Data mining","Computer science","Databases","Computer applications","Data engineering","Application software","Information technology","Natural languages","Information retrieval"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data mining","semantic networks","text analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["text mining framework","textual format","textual information","semantic network","transformation functions","specific field text","knowledge base repositories","textual data"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Proposed Framework","Knowledge discovery","Semantic network","Frames","Text mining","Knowledge base"]}],"abstract":"Every research field (domain) has a lot of data or information in textual format.

This method allows broadband input matching and without the use of inductors that are frequently required in low-noise mixer designs. The current-bleeding technique is also used so that a high conversion gain can be achieved.

Next, an example uses a multiphysics simulator to demonstrate that electrothermal nonlinearities behave as expected from the linear-nonlinear interaction model. Lastly, it illustrates how simple nonlinear models characterized with one circuit can accurately predict distortion levels when the nonlinearity is placed within a very different circuit, showing that knowledge of the interaction gives the ability to accurately predict the behavior of PIM-producing components in a variety of circuits such as resonators, filters, and matching networks.","doi":"10.1109/TMTT.2010.2045527","pdfPath":"/iel5/22/5463243/05446302.pdf","startPage":"1230","endPage":"1237","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMTT.2010.2045527","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5463243","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Linear\u2013Nonlinear Interaction and Passive Intermodulation Distortion","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5446302/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 April 2010","displayDocTitle":"Linear\u2013Nonlinear Interaction and Passive Intermodulation Distortion","volume":"58","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"27 May 2010","accessionNumber":"11285928","publicationDate":"May 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5446302/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Linear\u2013Nonlinear Interaction and Passive Intermodulation Distortion","sourcePdf":"tmtt-henrie-part1-2045527.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.082971S","chronDate":"May  2010","xplore-pub-id":"22","isNumber":"5463243","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"24","xplore-issue":"5463243","articleId":"5446302","onlineDate":"12 April 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5446312,"authors":[{"name":"Michel T.

While there is a law of conservation of energy in physics, there is no such law in information theory. Consequently, when, in information theory, reference is made (as it frequently is) to terms like energy, power, noise, or antennas, it is by no means guaranteed that their use is consistent with the physics of the communication system. Circuit theoretic multiport concepts can help in bridging the gap between the physics of electromagnetic fields and the mathematical world of information theory, so that important terms like energy or antenna are indeed used consistently through all layers of abstraction. In this paper, we develop circuit theoretic multiport models for radio communication systems. To demonstrate the utility of the circuit theoretic approach, an in-depth analysis is provided on the impact of impedance matching, antenna mutual coupling, and different sources of noise on the performance of the communication system. Interesting insights are developed about the role of impedance matching and the noise properties of the receive amplifiers, as well as the way array gain and channel capacity scale with the number of antennas in different circumstances. One particularly interesting result is that, with arrays of lossless antennas that receive isotropic background noise, efficient multistreaming can be achieved no matter how densely the antennas are packed.","doi":"10.1109/TCSI.2010.2043994","startPage":"1663","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","pdfPath":"/iel5/8919/5512812/05446312.pdf","endPage":"1683","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5512812","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSI.2010.2043994","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 April 2010","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5446312/","displayDocTitle":"Toward a Circuit Theory of Communication","volume":"57","issue":"7","dateOfInsertion":"19 July 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5446312/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11416867","publicationDate":"July 2010","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Toward a Circuit Theory of Communication","sourcePdf":"tcsi-nossek-2043994-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.128333S","chronDate":"July  2010","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"5512812","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"92","xplore-issue":"5512812","articleId":"5446312","onlineDate":"12 April 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5446314,"authors":[{"name":"Xiangning Lin","affiliation":["Electric Power Security and High Efficiency Laboratory, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"],"bio":{"p":["Xiangning Lin (SM'08) received the M.Sc. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from the Huazhong University of Science and Technology (HUST), Wuhan, China, respectively.","Currently, he is a Professor at HUST.

The results show that S-PIN diodes realized on SOI substrates are suitable for various microwave and millimeter-wave applications.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMTT.2010.2045523","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5463243","startPage":"1100","endPage":"1106","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel5/22/5463243/05446320.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Investigation of the S-PIN Diodes for Silicon Monolithic Antennas With Reconfigurable Aperture","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5446320/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 April 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5446320/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Investigation of the S-PIN Diodes for Silicon Monolithic Antennas With Reconfigurable Aperture","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2010","accessionNumber":"11285912","dateOfInsertion":"27 May 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"58","issue":"5","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Investigation of the S-PIN Diodes for Silicon Monolithic Antennas With Reconfigurable Aperture","sourcePdf":"58tmtt05-yyashchyshyn-part1-2045523.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.046381S","chronDate":"May  2010","xplore-pub-id":"22","isNumber":"5463243","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"5463243","articleId":"5446320","onlineDate":"12 April 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5446330,"authors":[{"name":"Donglin Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Calgary, Calgary, AB, Canada"],"firstName":"Donglin","lastName":"Wang","id":"37405353300"},{"name":"Michel Fattouche","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Calgary, Calgary, AB, Canada"],"firstName":"Michel","lastName":"Fattouche","id":"37332307700"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1070-9908"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2361"}],"articleNumber":"5446330","dbTime":"25 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":31,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":759},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.signalprocessingsociety.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Maximum likelihood estimation","Delay estimation","Propagation delay","AWGN","Performance analysis","Bandwidth","Discrete Fourier transforms","Baseband","Fourier transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","maximum likelihood estimation","OFDM modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["OFDM transmission","time-based range estimation","Cramer-Rao lower bound","maximum likelihood estimator","channel estimation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["CRLB","OFDM","probability of outlier","threshold region","time-based range estimation (TBRE)"]}],"abstract":"OFDM is proposed for time-based range estimation (TBRE) and analyzed with respect to its accuracy, both theoretically, in terms of its Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB), and practically, in terms of its maximum likelihood estimator (MLE).

Cardiac arrhythmia is a very common type of CVD and may indicate an increased risk of stroke or sudden cardiac death. The ECG is the most widely adopted clinical tool to diagnose and assess the risk of arrhythmia. ECGs measure and display the electrical activity of the heart from the body surface. During patients' hospital visits, however, arrhythmias may not be detected on standard resting ECG machines, since the condition may not be present at that moment in time. While Holter-based portable monitoring solutions offer 24-48 h ECG recording, they lack the capability of providing any real-time feedback for the thousands of heart beats they record, which must be tediously analyzed offline. In this paper, we seek to unite the portability of Holter monitors and the real-time processing capability of state-of-the-art resting ECG machines to provide an assistive diagnosis solution using smartphones. Specifically, we developed two smartphone-based wearable CVD-detection platforms capable of performing real-time ECG acquisition and display, feature extraction, and beat classification. Furthermore, the same statistical summaries available on resting ECG machines are provided.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5446331/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 April 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2010","publicationDate":"May 2010","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5446331/","dateOfInsertion":"01 June 2010","accessionNumber":"11328260","pubMedId":"20388600","volume":"14","issue":"3","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A Wearable Smartphone-Based Platform for Real-Time Cardiovascular Disease Detection Via Electrocardiogram Processing","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Wearable Smartphone-Based Platform for Real-Time Cardiovascular Disease Detection Via Electrocardiogram Processing","sourcePdf":"titb-oresko-2047865.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.100103S","chronDate":"May  2010","xplore-pub-id":"4233","isNumber":"5475408","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4233","citationCount":"243","xplore-issue":"5475408","articleId":"5446331","onlineDate":"12 April 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-09"},{"_id":5446335,"authors":[{"name":"Alireza Khaligh","affiliation":["Energy Harvesting and Renewable Energies Laboratory, Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Illinois Institute of Technology, Chicago, IL, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/5508587/5446335/5446335-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Alireza Khaligh (S'04\u2013M'06\u2013SM'09) received the B.S. and M.S. degrees from Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Iran, and the Ph.D. degree from Illinois Institute of Technology (IIT), Chicago, all in electrical engineering.","He is an Assistant Professor and the Director of Energy Harvesting and Renewable Energies Laboratory, Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, IIT, where he has established courses and curriculum in the areas of energy harvesting and renewable energy sources.

Energy-storage devices charge during low power demands and discharge during high power demands, acting as catalysts to provide energy boost. Batteries are the primary energy-storage devices in ground vehicles. Increasing the AER of vehicles by 15% almost doubles the incremental cost of the ESS. This is due to the fact that the ESS of HEVs requires higher peak power while preserving high energy density. Ultracapacitors (UCs) are the options with higher power densities in comparison with batteries. A hybrid ESS composed of batteries, UCs, and/or fuel cells (FCs) could be a more appropriate option for advanced hybrid vehicular ESSs. This paper presents state-of-the-art energy-storage topologies for HEVs and plug-in HEVs (PHEVs). Battery, UC, and FC technologies are discussed and compared in this paper.

The proposed approach is based on replacing the maximum-likelihood constraint with a finite set of power equality constraints (PECs), resulting in a set of nonconvex optimization problems, which can efficiently be solved using the hidden convexity methodology. Next, using specific structural properties of the proposed approach, we develop an ordered PEC algorithm, which provides a significant computational complexity reduction with no performance degradation. Based on that, an improved OPEC algorithm, which incorporates a heuristic local search, is proposed. Numerical results show that the proposed detectors significantly outperform the conventional minimum-mean-square-error (MMSE) detector in terms of bit error rate (BER) performance, with only a slightly higher complexity.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2010.2047957","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/5571765/05446336.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2010.2047957","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5571765","startPage":"3383","endPage":"3392","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"MIMO Detection With High-Level Modulations Using Power Equality Constraints","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5446336","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"MIMO Detection With High-Level Modulations Using Power Equality Constraints","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5446336/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 April 2010","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"59","issue":"7","publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","accessionNumber":"11523670","dateOfInsertion":"13 September 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5446336/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"MIMO Detection With High-Level Modulations Using Power Equality Constraints","sourcePdf":"tvt-nevat-2047957-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.064001S","chronDate":"Sept.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"5571765","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","xplore-issue":"5571765","articleId":"5446336","onlineDate":"12 April 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5446337,"authors":[{"name":"Annette Muetze","affiliation":["Institute of Electric Drives and Machines, Graz University of Technology, Graz, Austria"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/5492306/5446337/5446337-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Annette Muetze (S'03\u2013M'04\u2013SM'09) received the Dipl.-Ing. and Dr. Tech. degrees in electrical engineering from Darmstadt University of Technology, Darmstadt, Germany, in 1999 and 2004, and the Dipl.-Ing. degree in general engineering from the Ecole Centrale de Lyon, Ecully, France, in 1999.","During 2004, she was an Assistant Professor in the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison.

Increasing the power rating by minimizing switching frequency while still maintaining reasonable power quality is an important requirement and a persistent challenge for the industry. Existing solutions are discussed and analyzed based on their topologies, limitations, and control techniques. As a preferred option for future research and application, an inverter configuration based on three-level building blocks to generate five-level voltage waveforms is suggested. This paper shows that such an inverter may be operated at a very low switching frequency to achieve minimum on-state and dynamic device losses for highly efficient MV drive applications while maintaining low harmonic distortion.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5446354/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 April 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2010","volume":"57","issue":"8","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11465113","dateOfInsertion":"12 July 2010","publicationDate":"Aug. 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5446354/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Medium-Voltage Multilevel Converters\u2014State of the Art, Challenges, and Requirements in Industrial Applications","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Medium-Voltage Multilevel Converters\u2014State of the Art, Challenges, and Requirements in Industrial Applications","sourcePdf":"tie-aburub-2043039-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.266694S","chronDate":"Aug.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"5508599","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"851","xplore-issue":"5508599","articleId":"5446354","onlineDate":"12 April 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-24"},{"_id":5446357,"authors":[{"name":"Arash Salarian","affiliation":["Department of Neurology, Oregon Health and Sciences University, Portland, OR, USA","Laboratory of Movement Analysis and Measurement (LMAM), Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7333/5482410/5446357/5446357-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Arash Salarian (M'04) received the B.Sc. degree in computer engineering from Isfahan University of Technology, Isfahan, Iran (IUT), in 1993, the M.Sc. degree in computer architecture from Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Iran (SUT), in 1997, and the Ph.D. degree in biomedical engineering from Ecole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne (EPFL), in 2006.

Although TUG includes several complex subcomponents, namely: sit-to-stand, gait, 180\u00b0 turn, and turn-to-sit; the only outcome is the total time to perform the task. We have proposed an instrumented TUG, called iTUG, using portable inertial sensors to improve TUG in several ways: automatic detection and separation of subcomponents, detailed analysis of each one of them and a higher sensitivity than TUG. Twelve subjects in early stages of Parkinson's disease (PD) and 12 age matched control subjects were enrolled. Stopwatch measurements did not show a significant difference between the two groups. The iTUG, however, showed a significant difference in cadence between early PD and control subjects (111.1 \u00b1 6.2 versus 120.4 \u00b1 7.6 step/min, p <; 0.006) as well as in angular velocity of arm-swing (123 \u00b1 32.0 versus 174.0 \u00b1 50.4\u00b0/s, p <; 0.005), turning duration (2.18 \u00b1 0.43 versus 1.79 \u00b1 0.27 s, p <; 0.023), and time to perform turn-to-sits (2.96 \u00b1 0.68 versus 2.40 \u00b1 0.33 s, p <; 0.023). By repeating the tests for a second time, the test-retest reliability of iTUG was also evaluated.

These two quantities are not yet available globally or with adequate temporal or spatial sampling. It is recognized that a spaceborne L-band radiometer with a suitable antenna is the most promising way of fulfilling this gap. With these scientific objectives and technical solution at the heart of a proposed mission concept the European Space Agency (ESA) selected the Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) mission as its second Earth Explorer Opportunity Mission. The development of the SMOS mission was led by ESA in collaboration with the Centre National d'Etudes Spatiales (CNES) in France and the Centro para el Desarrollo Tecnologico Industrial (CDTI) in Spain. SMOS carries a single payload, an L-Band 2-D interferometric radiometer operating in the 1400-1427-MHz protected band . The instrument receives the radiation emitted from Earth's surface, which can then be related to the moisture content in the first few centimeters of soil over land, and to salinity in the surface waters of the oceans. SMOS will achieve an unprecedented maximum spatial resolution of 50 km at L-band over land (43 km on average over the field of view), providing multiangular dual polarized (or fully polarized) brightness temperatures over the globe. SMOS has a revisit time of less than 3 days so as to retrieve soil moisture and ocean salinity data, meeting the mission's science objectives. The caveat in relation to its sampling requirements is that SMOS will have a somewhat reduced sensitivity when compared to conventional radiometers. The SMOS satellite was launched successfully on November 2, 2009.","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5446359/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 April 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5446359/","dateOfInsertion":"06 May 2010","publicationDate":"May 2010","accessionNumber":"11340722","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"98","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"The SMOS Mission: New Tool for Monitoring Key Elements ofthe Global Water Cycle","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The SMOS Mission: New Tool for Monitoring Key Elements ofthe Global Water Cycle","sourcePdf":"jproc-kerr-2043032.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.218177S","chronDate":"May  2010","xplore-pub-id":"5","isNumber":"5461016","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"1179","xplore-issue":"5461016","articleId":"5446359","onlineDate":"12 April 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-11"},{"_id":5446379,"authors":[{"name":"Evgeni Genender","affiliation":["Electromagnetics Division, National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), Boulder, CO, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/15/5580183/5446379/5446379-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Evgeni Genender (S'08) was born in Russia, in 1984.

A practical example of the design of an EMI filter to comply with a regulatory conducted EMI limit using the proposed procedure is demonstrated and compared with the cases, where the noise source and noise termination impedances are not taken into account, or coarse estimates of them are considered. Although all approaches allow filtered SMPS to pass the regulation limits, designing EMI filters with the accurate noise source and termination impedances leads to optimal component values and avoids overdesign.","doi":"10.1109/TEMC.2010.2046419","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electromagnetic Compatibility","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electromagnetic Compatibility","pdfPath":"/iel5/15/5550281/05446382.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TEMC.2010.2046419","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5550281","startPage":"588","endPage":"598","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Systematic Electromagnetic Interference Filter Design Based on Information From In-Circuit Impedance Measurements","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5446382","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Systematic Electromagnetic Interference Filter Design Based on Information From In-Circuit Impedance Measurements","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5446382/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 April 2010","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"52","issue":"3","publicationDate":"Aug. 2010","accessionNumber":"11473300","dateOfInsertion":"16 August 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5446382/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Systematic Electromagnetic Interference Filter Design Based on Information From In-Circuit Impedance Measurements","sourcePdf":"temc-tarateeraseth-2046419-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.070437S","chronDate":"Aug.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"15","isNumber":"5550281","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"15","citationCount":"56","xplore-issue":"5550281","articleId":"5446382","onlineDate":"12 April 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-22"},{"_id":5446385,"authors":[{"name":"Akshay K.

Renewable energy, mainly wind and solar, can reduce emission from the electricity industry (mainly from power plants). Likewise, next-generation plug-in vehicles, which include plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (EVs) and EVs with vehicle-to-grid capability, referred to as \u201cgridable vehicles\u201d (GVs) by the authors, can reduce emission from the transportation industry. GVs can be used as loads, energy sources (small portable power plants), and energy storages in a smart grid integrated with renewable energy sources (RESs). Smart grid operation to reduce both cost and emission simultaneously is a very complex task considering smart charging and discharging of GVs in a distributed energy source and load environment. If a large number of GVs is connected to the electric grid randomly, peak load will be very high. The use of traditional thermal power plants will be economically and environmentally expensive to support the electrified transportation. The intelligent scheduling and control of GVs as loads and/or sources have great potential for evolving a sustainable integrated electricity and transportation infrastructure. Cost and emission reductions in a smart grid by maximum utilization of GVs and RESs are presented in this paper. Possible models for GV applications, including the smart grid model, are given, and results are presented. The smart grid model offers the best potential for maximum utilization of RESs to reduce cost and emission from the electricity industry.","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2010.2047828","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2010.2047828","startPage":"1229","endPage":"1238","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/41/5727983/05446386.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5727983","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Plug-in Vehicles and Renewable Energy Sources for Cost and Emission Reductions","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5446386/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 April 2010","displayDocTitle":"Plug-in Vehicles and Renewable Energy Sources for Cost and Emission Reductions","volume":"58","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"10 March 2011","accessionNumber":"11862375","publicationDate":"April 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5446386/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Plug-in Vehicles and Renewable Energy Sources for Cost and Emission Reductions","sourcePdf":"tie-saber-2047828-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.087416S","chronDate":"April  2011","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"5727983","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"528","xplore-issue":"5727983","articleId":"5446386","onlineDate":"12 April 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5446392,"authors":[{"name":"Shi Jin","affiliation":["National Mobile Communications Research Laboratory, School of Information Science and Engineering, South-East University, Nanjing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/5508587/5446392/5446392-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Shi Jin (S'06\u2013M'07) received the B.S. degree in communication engineering from the Guilin University of Electronic Technology, Guilin, China, in 1996, the M.S. degree from Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Nanjing, China, in 2003, and the Ph.D. degree in communication and information system from the Southeast University, Nanjing, in 2007.","Since 2007, he has been with the faculty of the National Mobile Communications Research Laboratory, School of Information Science and Engineering, Southeast University.

The sparsity pattern is assumed to change slowly with time. The key idea of our proposed solution, LS-CS-residual (LS-CS), is to replace compressed sensing (CS) on the observation by CS on the least squares (LS) residual computed using the previous estimate of the support. We bound CS-residual error and show that when the number of available measurements is small, the bound is much smaller than that on CS error if the sparsity pattern changes slowly enough. Most importantly, under fairly mild assumptions, we show \u201cstability\u201d of LS-CS over time for a signal model that allows support additions and removals, and that allows coefficients to gradually increase (decrease) until they reach a constant value (become zero). By \u201cstability,\u201d we mean that the number of misses and extras in the support estimate remain bounded by time-invariant values (in turn implying a time-invariant bound on LS-CS error). Numerical experiments, and a dynamic MRI example, backing our claims are shown.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"LS-CS-Residual (LS-CS): Compressive Sensing on Least Squares Residual","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2010.2048105","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/5508649/05446399.pdf","startPage":"4108","endPage":"4120","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2010.2048105","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5508649","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5446399","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5446399/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 April 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2010","displayDocTitle":"LS-CS-Residual (LS-CS): Compressive Sensing on Least Squares Residual","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"58","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/5446399/","dateOfInsertion":"12 July 2010","publicationDate":"Aug. 2010","accessionNumber":"11465441","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"LS-CS-Residual (LS-CS): Compressive Sensing on Least Squares Residual","sourcePdf":"tsp-nvaswani-2048105-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.171542S","chronDate":"Aug.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"5508649","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"105","xplore-issue":"5508649","articleId":"5446399","onlineDate":"12 April 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5446400,"authors":[{"name":"Mark T.

We present a novel image processing system to detect and track vehicle rear-lamp pairs in forward-facing color video. A standard low-cost camera with a complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) sensor and Bayer red-green-blue (RGB) color filter is used and could be utilized for full-color image display or other color image processing applications. The appearance of rear lamps in video and imagery can dramatically change, depending on camera hardware; therefore, we suggest a camera-configuration process that optimizes the appearance of rear lamps for segmentation. Rear-facing lamps are segmented from low-exposure forward-facing color video using a red-color threshold. Unlike previous work in the area, which uses subjective color threshold boundaries, our color threshold is directly derived from automotive regulations and adapted for real-world conditions in the hue-saturation-value (HSV) color space. Lamps are paired using color cross-correlation symmetry analysis and tracked using Kalman filtering. A tracking-based detection stage is introduced to improve robustness and to deal with distortions caused by other light sources and perspective distortion, which are common in automotive environments. Results that demonstrate the system's high detection rates, operating distance, and robustness to different lighting conditions and road environments are presented.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Vehicle detection","Color","Lamps","CMOS image sensors","Cameras","Image segmentation","Automotive engineering","Robustness","Vehicle driving","Collision mitigation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS image sensors","driver information systems","image colour analysis","image segmentation","Kalman filters","light sources","optical filters","tracking","video signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["rear lamp vehicle detection","tracking","color video","night conditions","advanced driver assistance systems","image processing system","complementary metal oxide semiconductor sensor","Bayer red-green-blue color filter","color image display","camera configuration process","image segmentation","hue saturation value color space","Kalman filtering","perspective distortion","light sources","CMOS sensor"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Computer vision","driver assistance","tail-lamp detection","vehicle detection","video processing"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TITS.2010.2045375","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/6979/5475419/05446402.pdf","startPage":"453","endPage":"462","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5475419","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TITS.2010.2045375","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Rear-Lamp Vehicle Detection and Tracking in Low-Exposure Color Video for Night Conditions","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5446402","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Rear-Lamp Vehicle Detection and Tracking in Low-Exposure Color Video for Night Conditions","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5446402/","volume":"11","issue":"2","publicationDate":"June 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5446402/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"11328305","dateOfInsertion":"01 June 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 April 2010","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Rear-Lamp Vehicle Detection and Tracking in Low-Exposure Color Video for Night Conditions","sourcePdf":"tits-omalley-2045375.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.073498S","chronDate":"June  2010","xplore-pub-id":"6979","isNumber":"5475419","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6979","citationCount":"158","xplore-issue":"5475419","articleId":"5446402","onlineDate":"12 April 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":5446405,"authors":[{"name":"Enzo C.

Although there are numerous types of motor fault, research conducted by Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI) indicated that motor bearing fault accounted for more than 40% of all types of motor fault. The main aim of this paper is to evaluate the use of MCSA for detecting bearing outer raceway defect. Stage-by-stage experimental verification shows that the method of MCSA is effective in detecting bearing fault with the use of wavelet packet transformation (WPT).

To support dynamic voltage scaling, the level converter can upconvert an input at any voltage within this range to 1.2 V.","doi":"10.1109/TCSII.2010.2043471","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSII.2010.2043471","startPage":"290","endPage":"294","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs","pdfPath":"/iel5/8920/5452111/05446412.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5452111","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Energy-Efficient Subthreshold Level Converter in 130-nm CMOS","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5446412/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 April 2010","displayDocTitle":"An Energy-Efficient Subthreshold Level Converter in 130-nm CMOS","volume":"57","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"19 April 2010","accessionNumber":"11256578","publicationDate":"April 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5446412/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Energy-Efficient Subthreshold Level Converter in 130-nm CMOS","sourcePdf":"tcsii-wooters-2043471.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.095742S","chronDate":"April  2010","xplore-pub-id":"8920","isNumber":"5452111","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8920","citationCount":"83","xplore-issue":"5452111","articleId":"5446412","onlineDate":"12 April 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5446413,"authors":[{"name":"Mehdi Kiani","affiliation":["GT-Bionics Laboratory, School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"firstName":"Mehdi","lastName":"Kiani","id":"37397488400"},{"name":"Maysam Ghovanloo","affiliation":["GT-Bionics Laboratory, School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"firstName":"Maysam","lastName":"Ghovanloo","id":"37275363200"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1549-7747"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-3791"}],"articleNumber":"5446413","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":112,"citationCountPatent":4,"totalDownloads":3466},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Circuits and Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieee-cas.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power transmission","Radiofrequency identification","Radio transmitters","Voltage","Radio frequency","Implantable biomedical devices","Coils","Circuits","Telemetry","Implants"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biomedical equipment","closed loop systems","inductive power transmission","radiofrequency identification","radiofrequency integrated circuits","telemedicine"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["RFID-based closed-loop wireless power transmission system","biomedical applications","radio-frequency identification reader","TRF7960","implantable biomedical devices","near-field wireless power transmission","RFID circuits","back telemetry","frequency 13.56 MHz"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Closed-loop inductive power transmission","implantable biomedical devices","radio-frequency identification (RFID) reader"]}],"abstract":"This brief presents a standalone closed-loop wireless power transmission system that is built around a commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) radio-frequency identification (RFID) reader (TRF7960) operating at 13.56 MHz. It can be used for inductively powering implantable biomedical devices in a closed loop. Any changes in the distance and misalignment between transmitter and receiver coils in near-field wireless power transmission can cause a significant change in the received power, which can cause either a malfunction or excessive heat dissipation. RFID circuits are often used in an open loop. However, their back telemetry capability can be utilized to stabilize the received voltage on the implant. Our measurements showed that the delivered power to the transponder was maintained at 11.2 mW over a range of 0.5 to 2 cm, while the transmitter power consumption changed from 78 mW to 1.1 W. The closed-loop system can also oppose voltage variations as a result of sudden changes in the load current.","doi":"10.1109/TCSII.2010.2043470","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs","pdfPath":"/iel5/8920/5452111/05446413.pdf","startPage":"260","endPage":"264","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5452111","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSII.2010.2043470","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An RFID-Based Closed-Loop Wireless Power Transmission System for Biomedical Applications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5446413","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2010","displayDocTitle":"An RFID-Based Closed-Loop Wireless Power Transmission System for Biomedical Applications","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5446413/","publicationDate":"April 2010","dateOfInsertion":"19 April 2010","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"11256571","pubMedId":"21179391","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5446413/","volume":"57","issue":"4","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 April 2010","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An RFID-Based Closed-Loop Wireless Power Transmission System for Biomedical Applications","sourcePdf":"tcsii-ghovanloo-2043470.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.057026S","chronDate":"April  2010","xplore-pub-id":"8920","isNumber":"5452111","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8920","citationCount":"112","xplore-issue":"5452111","articleId":"5446413","onlineDate":"12 April 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5446416,"authors":[{"name":"Marcelo Suetake","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/5711419/5446416/5446416-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Marcelo Suetake was born in Rin\u00f3polis, Brazil, in 1981.

Three different objectives, wind power output, vibration of drive train, and vibration of tower, are used to evaluate the wind turbine performance.

Data sets at two different frequencies, 10 s and 1 min, are used in this study. Computational results with the two data sets are reported. Analysis of these results points to a reduction of wind turbine vibrations potentially larger than the gains reported in the paper.

This success was mainly due to the fact that this pair of chips was able to transfer data at ~ 1 Gb/s with a deterministic latency, fixed after each power up or reset of the link. Despite this unique timing feature, Agilent discontinued the production and no compatible commercial off-the-shelf chip-sets are available. The ATLAS Level-1 Muon trigger includes some serial links based on GLink in order to transfer data from the detector to the counting room. The transmission side of the links will not be upgraded, however a replacement for the receivers in the counting room in case of failures is needed. In this paper, we present a solution to replace GLink transmitters and/or receivers. Our design is based on the gigabit serial IO (GTP) embedded in a Xilinx Virtex 5 Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA). We present the architecture and we discuss parameters of the implementation such as latency and resource occupation. We compare the GLink chip-set and the GTP-based emulator in terms of latency, eye diagram and power dissipation.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Field programmable gate arrays","Transceivers","Mesons","Delay","Timing","Production","Detectors","Transmitters","Signal analysis","Power dissipation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data acquisition","data communication","field programmable gate arrays","nuclear electronics","nuclear instrumentation","transceivers","transition radiation detectors","trigger circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["GLink chip set","FPGA serial transceivers","ATLAS Level-1 Muon Trigger","high energy physics experiments","serial links","Agilent HDMP-1032/34A serializer/deserializer chip set","data transfer","timing feature","counting room","GLink transmitters","gigabit serial IO","Xilinx Virtex 5 FPGA","field programmable gate array","latency","resource occupation","eye diagram","power dissipation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Fixed latency","FPGAs","serial links"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5446525","doi":"10.1109/TNS.2009.2036175","startPage":"467","endPage":"471","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","pdfPath":"/iel5/23/5446471/05446525.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5446471","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNS.2009.2036175","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 April 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5446525/","displayDocTitle":"Emulating the GLink Chip Set With FPGA Serial Transceivers in the ATLAS Level-1 Muon Trigger","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2010","volume":"57","issue":"2","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2010","dateOfInsertion":"12 April 2010","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"11246591","htmlLink":"/document/5446525/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Emulating the GLink Chip Set With FPGA Serial Transceivers in the ATLAS Level-1 Muon Trigger","sourcePdf":"tns-rgiordano-2036175.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.072033S","chronDate":"April  2010","xplore-pub-id":"23","isNumber":"5446471","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"5446471","articleId":"5446525","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5446535,"authors":[{"name":"Vladimir I.

The boundary between hardware drivers, system services, and user code is commonly not well defined, making the development in the target host significantly difficult. The Multithreaded Application Real-Time executor (MARTe) is a framework built over a multiplatform library that allows the execution of the same code in different operating systems. The framework provides the high-level interfaces with hardware, external configuration programs, and user interfaces, assuring at the same time hard real-time performances. End-users of the framework are required to define and implement algorithms inside a well-defined block of software, named Generic Application Module (GAM), that is executed by the real-time scheduler. Each GAM is reconfigurable with a set of predefined configuration meta-parameters and interchanges information using a set of data pipes that are provided as inputs and required as output. Using these connections, different GAMs can be chained either in series or parallel. GAMs can be developed and debugged in a non-real-time system and, only once the robustness of the code and correctness of the algorithm are verified, deployed to the real-time system. The software also supplies a large set of utilities that greatly ease the interaction and debugging of a running system. Among the most useful are a highly efficient real-time logger, HTTP introspection of real-time objects, and HTTP remote configuration. MARTe is currently being used to successfully drive the plasma vertical stabilization controller on the largest magnetic confinement fusion device in the world, with a control loop cycle of 50 ?s and a jitter under 1 ?s. In this particular project, MARTe is used with the Real-Time Application Interface (RTAI)/Linux operating system exploiting the new ?86 multicore processors technology.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"MARTe: A Multiplatform Real-Time Framework","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","doi":"10.1109/TNS.2009.2037815","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","pdfPath":"/iel5/23/5446471/05446608.pdf","startPage":"479","endPage":"486","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNS.2009.2037815","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5446471","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5446608","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5446608/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 April 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2010","displayDocTitle":"MARTe: A Multiplatform Real-Time Framework","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"57","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/5446608/","dateOfInsertion":"12 April 2010","publicationDate":"April 2010","accessionNumber":"11228926","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"MARTe: A Multiplatform Real-Time Framework","sourcePdf":"tns-neto-2037815.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.052138S","chronDate":"April  2010","xplore-pub-id":"23","isNumber":"5446471","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"112","xplore-issue":"5446471","articleId":"5446608","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5446660,"authors":[{"name":"Jon-Paul Anderson","affiliation":["NSF Center of High-Performance Reconfigurable Computing (CHREC), Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Brigham Young University, Provo, UT, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5440860/5446655/5446660/5446660-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jon-Paul Anderson received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering from Brigham Young University, Provo, UT in 2000.

A critical failure is defined as an upset whose effects can only be repaired through device reconfiguration. Cost is measured in terms of FPGA slices and BRAMs. This study finds that for BRAMs and LUTRAMs scrubbing with TMR provides the best protection.

Cascaded (multi-stage) designs of Multi-Rate FIR (MRFIR) filters are further used for large rate change ratio, in order to lower the required throughput while simultaneously achieving comparable or better performance than single-stage designs. Traditional representation and implementation of MRFIR employ polyphase decomposition of the original filter structure, whose main purpose is to compute only the needed output at the lowest possible sampling rate. In this paper, an alternative representation and implementation technique, called TD-MRFIR (Thread Decomposition MRFIR), is presented. The basic idea is to decompose MRFIR into output computational threads, in contrast to a structural decomposition of the original filter as done in the polyphase decomposition. Each thread represents an instance of the finite convolution required to produce a single output of the MRFIR. The filter is thus viewed as a finite collection of concurrent threads. The technical details of TD-MRFIR will be explained, first showing its applicability to the implementation of downsampling, upsampling, and resampling FIR filters, and then describing a general strategy to optimally allocate the number of filter taps. A particular FPGA design of multi-stage TD-MRFIR for the L-band radar of NASA's SMAP (Soil Moisture Active Passive) instrument is demonstrated; and its implementation results in several targeted FPGA devices are summarized in terms of the functional (bit width, fixed-point error) and performance (time closure, resource usage, and power estimation) parameters.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/AERO.2010.5446665","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5446655","startPage":"1","endPage":"10","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Aerospace Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5440860/5446655/05446665.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimized FPGA implementation of Multi-Rate FIR filters through Thread Decomposition","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5446665/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-13 March 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5446665/","displayDocTitle":"Optimized FPGA implementation of Multi-Rate FIR filters through Thread Decomposition","conferenceDate":"6-13 March 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2010","accessionNumber":"11258471","dateOfInsertion":"15 April 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimized FPGA implementation of Multi-Rate FIR filters through Thread Decomposition","confLoc":"Big Sky, MT, USA","sourcePdf":"z070202.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.262396S","chronDate":"6-13 March 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5440860","isNumber":"5446655","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5440860","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"5446655","articleId":"5446665","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5446684,"authors":[{"name":"A.

Although different aspects of MIMO radars have been discussed in the literature, the application of MIMO radars in target tracking problems has not been explored in depth. Target localization using MIMO radars with co-located antennas has been discussed in the literature. The main limitation of those approaches is that the number of targets that can be uniquely localized in one cell is restricted. This paper presents a new application of MIMO radars in Multi-Target Tracking (MTT) problems. The main contribution is to show that the use of prior information about the motion of targets relaxes the limitation on the number of targets that can be uniquely detected. A general MTT problem with several targets in the same resolution cell is considered. The goal is to propose a technique to estimate targets' states and the number of targets in one cell. Because multiple targets may fall in the same cell, the measurement in a cell is associated with more than one target. Measurements are outputs of matched filters and range bins that are nonlinear functions of targets' states. Multiple hypotheses are generated based on the uncertainty in target-to-cell association. Then, the best model which gives the number of new targets whose estimates are obtained by the localization algorithm, is selected according to its likelihood . Finally, due to the nonlinearity in measurement model, a UKF based method is used to update estimates of new targets and initialize new born targets. Simulation results show the superiority of the proposed method for joint localization and tracking compared to the previous localization approach suggested in the literature for unresolved targets.","doi":"10.1109/AERO.2010.5446684","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Aerospace Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Aerospace Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5440860/5446655/05446684.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/AERO.2010.5446684","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5446655","startPage":"1","endPage":"14","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Tracking multiple unresolved targets using MIMO radars","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5446684","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Tracking multiple unresolved targets using MIMO radars","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-13 March 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5446684/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"6-13 March 2010","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"March 2010","accessionNumber":"11258490","dateOfInsertion":"15 April 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5446684/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Tracking multiple unresolved targets using MIMO radars","confLoc":"Big Sky, MT, USA","sourcePdf":"z060806.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.104403S","chronDate":"6-13 March 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5440860","isNumber":"5446655","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5440860","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"5446655","articleId":"5446684","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5446687,"authors":[{"name":"Biruk K.

Unlike beam forming, which presumes a high correlation between signals either transmitted or received by an array, the MIMO system exploits the independence between signals at the array elements due to transmit diversity. Previous works focus on waveform design, signal processing and target localization with MIMO radars while no attention has been given to tracking algorithms. In this work, the problem of tracking multiple targets using MIMO radars is considered. The scenario includes multiple targets in a widely-separated MIMO architecture in which Radar-Cross-Section (RCS) diversity can be utilized. Multi target version of Track-Before-Detect (TBD) algorithm is implemented for the collected M \u00d7 N orthogonal signals at the receiver, where M is the number of transmitters and N is the number of receivers. Besides having the advantage of integrating information over time on unthresholded measurements to yield detection and tracking simultaneously, the TBD technique enables tracking and detecting targets in low Signal-to-Noise-Ratio (SNR) environments. Also, a modified multiple sensor TBD, which weights the target observability to the sensor as a result of target RCS diversity in the likelihood calculation to best fit the centralized MIMO tracking is proposed. Finally, Monte Carlo simulations are performed to evaluate the performance of the proposed tracking algorithm.","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Aerospace Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5440860/5446655/05446687.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"9","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Aerospace Conference","doi":"10.1109/AERO.2010.5446687","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/AERO.2010.5446687","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5446655","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5446687","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multitarget track before detect with MIMO radars","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Radar tracking","Radar detection","MIMO","Target tracking","Radar cross section","Signal processing algorithms","Radar signal processing","Process design","Signal design","Algorithm design and analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO radar","Monte Carlo methods","radar cross-sections","radar receivers","radar tracking","radar transmitters","target tracking"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multitarget track","MIMO radar system","multiple-input-multiple-output radar system","target detection","target localization performance","bistatic radar","multistatic radar","transmit diversity","MIMO architecture","radar-cross-section diversity","track-before-detect algorithm","orthogonal signal","receiver","transmitter","unthresholded measurement","TBD technique","signal-to-noise-ratio","SNR environment","multiple sensor TBD","target observability","Monte Carlo simulation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5446687/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-13 March 2010","displayDocTitle":"Multitarget track before detect with MIMO radars","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5446687/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2010","accessionNumber":"11258493","dateOfInsertion":"15 April 2010","conferenceDate":"6-13 March 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multitarget track before detect with MIMO radars","confLoc":"Big Sky, MT, USA","sourcePdf":"z060805.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061596S","chronDate":"6-13 March 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5440860","isNumber":"5446655","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5440860","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"5446655","articleId":"5446687","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5446694,"authors":[{"name":"D.

These satellites are being introduced recently for Satellite Mobile Digital TV broadcast purpose. Since they are designed to allow mobile users to receive satellite TV without large antennas, a sufficiently high signal power is being transmitted, making them suitable as illuminators of opportunity in a passive radar system. The possibility to resort to a quasi-stationary transmitter is shown to highly simplify the signal processing required by the passive radar system. A preliminary evaluation of the achievable SNR is conducted, showing that mid-range target detection can be achieved with reliable performance. In addition, a detailed analysis of the Doppler frequency contributions is conducted. Specifically, the Doppler frequency contribution due to the motion between target and transmitter is shown to be locally independent over the target position. The overall bistatic Doppler frequency behavior is evaluated for several possible target trajectories and some critical trajectories are identified. Finally, some remarks referred to the 2D Cross Correlation Function (2D-CCF) evaluation are reported.","doi":"10.1109/AERO.2010.5446694","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Aerospace Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5440860/5446655/05446694.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5446655","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/AERO.2010.5446694","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Aerospace Conference","startPage":"1","endPage":"11","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Space-based passive radar enabled by the new generation of geostationary broadcast satellites","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5446694","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-13 March 2010","displayDocTitle":"Space-based passive radar enabled by the new generation of geostationary broadcast satellites","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5446694/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5446694/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2010","accessionNumber":"11258500","dateOfInsertion":"15 April 2010","conferenceDate":"6-13 March 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Space-based passive radar enabled by the new generation of geostationary broadcast satellites","confLoc":"Big Sky, MT, USA","sourcePdf":"z060403.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051568S","chronDate":"6-13 March 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5440860","isNumber":"5446655","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5440860","citationCount":"37","xplore-issue":"5446655","articleId":"5446694","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5446700,"authors":[{"name":"Dmitriy L.

JPL has been developing a Multiangle SpectroPolarimetric Imager (MSPI) as a candidate to fill this need. A key technology development needed for MSPI is on-board signal processing to calculate polarimetry data as imaged by each of the 9 cameras forming the instrument. With funding from NASA's Advanced Information Systems Technology (AIST) Program, JPL is solving the real-time data processing requirements to demonstrate, for the first time, how signal data at 95 Mbytes/sec over 16-channels for each of the 9 multiangle cameras in the spaceborne instrument can be reduced on-board to 0.45 Mbytes/sec. This will produce the intensity and polarization data needed to characterize aerosol and cloud microphysical properties. Using the Xilinx Virtex-5 FPGA platform, a polarimetric processing least-squares fitting algorithm is under development to meet MSPI's on-board processing (OBP) requirements. The Virtex-5 FPGA is not yet space-flight qualified; however, an in-flight validation of this technology on a pre-cursor CubeSat mission is valuable toward advancing the technology readiness level for MSPI and the ACE mission. The Michigan Multipurpose Minisatellite (M-Cubed) is a CubeSat under development by students at the University of Michigan in the Student Space Systems Fabrication Lab (S3FL). The satellite meets the California Polytechnic Institute's (CalPoly's) specifications for a 1U CubeSat. MCubed's primary mission objective is to obtain quality color images of the Earth from Low Earth Orbit (LEO). MCubed's primary payload is an IDS UI-1646LE-C 1.3 MegaPixel CMOS Camera that will take the images and save them to a Colibri PXA270 Microprocessor. The camera has a resolution of 1280?1024 pixels, each with a size of 3.6 ? 3.6 micrometers. This allows for moderate to highresolution images of the Earth after post-processing. With the current system, there is enough excess volume, power, and mass to support an additional payload. In order for MCubed to carry out any additional objectives using other payloads, the attitude, power, mass, volume, and communication capabilities must be compatible. This paper describes the collaborative efforts between the University of Michigan M-Cubed team and JPL's MSPI OBP team to define an integrated CubeSat payload to demonstrate the Xilinx Virtex-5 MSPI OBP algorithm by processing images from the M-Cubed CMOS camera. The outcome of a feasibility study will be described as it pertains to design requirements, payload architecture, interface design, mission objectives, and operational scenarios to advance this collaborative concept toward implementation in 2010.","doi":"10.1109/AERO.2010.5446700","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Aerospace Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Aerospace Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5440860/5446655/05446700.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"9","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/AERO.2010.5446700","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5446655","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A CubeSat design to validate the Virtex-5 FPGA for spaceborne image processing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5446700","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-13 March 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5446700/","displayDocTitle":"A CubeSat design to validate the Virtex-5 FPGA for spaceborne image processing","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"March 2010","accessionNumber":"11258506","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5446700/","conferenceDate":"6-13 March 2010","dateOfInsertion":"15 April 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A CubeSat design to validate the Virtex-5 FPGA for spaceborne image processing","confLoc":"Big Sky, MT, USA","sourcePdf":"z060102.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061048S","chronDate":"6-13 March 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5440860","isNumber":"5446655","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5440860","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"5446655","articleId":"5446700","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5446702,"authors":[{"name":"Daniel A.

To obtain accurate predictions of component life, a variety of sensors are often needed. However, it is typically difficult to add enough sensors for reliable prognosis, due to system constraints such as cost and weight. Model-based prognostics helps to offset this problem by exploiting domain knowledge about the system, its components, and how they fail by casting the underlying physical phenomena in a physics-based model that is derived from first principles. We develop a model-based prognostics methodology using particle filters, and investigate the benefits of a model-based approach when sensor sets are diminished. We apply our approach to a detailed physics-based model of a pneumatic valve, and perform comprehensive simulation experiments to demonstrate the robustness of model-based approaches under limited sensing scenarios using prognostics performance metrics.","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Aerospace Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5440860/5446655/05446822.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"12","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Aerospace Conference","doi":"10.1109/AERO.2010.5446822","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/AERO.2010.5446822","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5446655","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5446822","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Model-based prognostics under limited sensing","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Particle filters","Filtering","Robustness","Sensor phenomena and characterization","Uncertainty","Predictive models","NASA","Batteries","Valves","Working environment noise"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["condition monitoring","maintenance engineering","particle filtering (numerical methods)","pneumatic systems","sensors","valves"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["model-based prognostics","condition-based maintenance","sensors","physics-based model","particle filters","pneumatic valve"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5446822/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-13 March 2010","displayDocTitle":"Model-based prognostics under limited sensing","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5446822/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2010","accessionNumber":"11258583","dateOfInsertion":"15 April 2010","conferenceDate":"6-13 March 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Model-based prognostics under limited sensing","confLoc":"Big Sky, MT, USA","sourcePdf":"z110503.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.077708S","chronDate":"6-13 March 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5440860","isNumber":"5446655","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5440860","citationCount":"40","xplore-issue":"5446655","articleId":"5446822","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5446826,"authors":[{"name":"Anuradha Kodali","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Connecticut, Storrs, CT, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5440860/5446655/5446826/5446826-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Anuradha Kodali is presently a PhD student in Electrical and Computer Engineering at University of Connecticut.

In our previous research, the problem of diagnosing dynamic multiple faults (DMFD) is solved by assuming that the faults are independent. Here, we extend this formulation to determine the most likely evolution of dependent fault states (NP-hard problem), the one that best explains the observed test outcomes over time. An iterative Gauss-Seidel coordinate ascent optimization method along with the coupling assumptions (mixed memory Markov model) is proposed for solving the dynamic coupled fault diagnosis (DCFD) problem. A soft Viterbi algorithm is also implemented within the framework for decoding dependent fault states over time. We demonstrate the algorithm on small-scale and real-world systems and the simulation results show that this approach improves the correct isolation rate as compared to the formulation with independent fault states (DMFD).","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Aerospace Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5440860/5446655/05446826.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"11","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Aerospace Conference","doi":"10.1109/AERO.2010.5446826","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/AERO.2010.5446826","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5446655","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5446826","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A coupled factorial hidden Markov model (CFHMM) for diagnosing coupled faults","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hidden Markov models","NP-hard problem","Testing","Iterative methods","Gaussian processes","Optimization methods","Fault diagnosis","Viterbi algorithm","Iterative decoding","Iterative algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","computerised instrumentation","fault diagnosis","Markov processes","maximum likelihood estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["coupled factorial hidden Markov Model","coupled faults diagnosis","diagnosing dynamic multiple faults","NP-hard problem","iterative Gauss-Seidel coordinate ascent optimization method","coupling assumptions","memory Markov model","dynamic coupled fault diagnosis","soft Viterbi algorithm","independent fault states"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5446826/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-13 March 2010","displayDocTitle":"A coupled factorial hidden Markov model (CFHMM) for diagnosing coupled faults","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5446826/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2010","accessionNumber":"11258587","dateOfInsertion":"15 April 2010","conferenceDate":"6-13 March 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A coupled factorial hidden Markov model (CFHMM) for diagnosing coupled faults","confLoc":"Big Sky, MT, USA","sourcePdf":"z110507.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065586S","chronDate":"6-13 March 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5440860","isNumber":"5446655","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5440860","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5446655","articleId":"5446826","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":5446832,"authors":[{"name":"Yilu Zhang","affiliation":["Electrical and Controls Integrations Laboratory, GM Research and Development Center, Warren, MI, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Yilu Zhang received his B.S., and M.S. degrees in Electrical Engineering from Zhejiang University, China, in 1994, and 1997, respectively; and his Ph.D. degree in Computer Science from Michigan State University in 2002.

A total of twenty six different tools, programs, and major technologies were used in the downlink portion of the ground system and five different tools, programs, and major technologies are used for the uplink portion. This collection of tools, programs, and technologies were not considered in the initial ground system design at the beginning of operations, but were added as they were needed to address changing requirements. During the pre-launch phase of Cassini Huygens in 1997, operations were performed in a limited capacity in the calibration facilities. After launch, process automation increased gradually, as the ground system continued to grow. New technologies were incorporated as they emerged, and were added to the ground system, although they may not have been part of the initial plans. This led to some unexpected and sometimes creative inter-connectivity solutions to ensure that they could be integrated with the existing system. This paper will document the changes in the ground system from the period just before the first instrument check-out in January 1999 through the end of 2008. We will discuss why the technologies, programs, and tools were added. Lastly, we will look at the ground system from a management perspective in an attempt to determine how the system could have been built modularly, considering that emerging technologies and other capabilities could be added at a later date.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Supply chains","Supply chain management","Costs","Humans","Space technology","Manufacturing","Space missions","Technological innovation","NASA","Aerospace industry"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["aerospace computing","aerospace robotics","ground support systems","programming languages","software tools"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Cassini CAPS ground system evolution","software tools","programming languages","downlink portion","uplink portion","Cassini Huygens","process automation","interconnectivity solutions","management perspective"]}],"doi":"10.1109/AERO.2010.5446855","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Aerospace Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Aerospace Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5440860/5446655/05446855.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"9","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5446655","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/AERO.2010.5446855","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cassini CAPS ground system evolution and lessons learned","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5446855","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Cassini CAPS ground system evolution and lessons learned","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5446855/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"March 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5446855/","accessionNumber":"11258273","conferenceDate":"6-13 March 2010","dateOfInsertion":"15 April 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-13 March 2010","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cassini CAPS ground system evolution and lessons learned","confLoc":"Big Sky, MT, USA","sourcePdf":"z120702.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.13598S","chronDate":"6-13 March 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5440860","isNumber":"5446655","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5440860","xplore-issue":"5446655","articleId":"5446855","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5446896,"authors":[{"name":"Zhijun Zhao","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Michigan Technological University, Houghton, MI, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5440860/5446655/5446896/5446896-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Zhijun Zhao received his Ph.D. degree in Electrical Engineering from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Urbana, Illinois in 2006.

For the same average received optical signal power, the degradation in BER performance is strongly dependent on the fading statistics. This paper studies channel coding using the Reed-Solomon (RS) codes for improving the FSO communication system performance and communication distance. Large-scale numerical simulations have been conducted to obtain the channel fading statistics and average received power for different receiver aperture sizes and distances of focused laser beams along the horizontal paths. The avalanche photodiode (APD) photodetector is used for direct detection, and the accurate McIntyre-Conradi model is adopted for system performance evaluation. Under codeword symbol level channel interleaving, if the channel demodulator provides channel erasure information when the channel is in deep fades, the RS codes are able to achieve more than 13 dB coding gain at BER = 10\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">-5</sup>\n and more than 17 dB coding gain at BER = 10\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">-6</sup>\n. It is also shown that for relatively weak fading channels, the channel coding using the RS codes can achieve the BER performance almost identical to that of the corresponding ideal fading-free channel. The optimal receiver aperture sizes under channel coding are also studied.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reed-Solomon coding for free-space optical communications through turbulent atmosphere","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Aerospace Conference","doi":"10.1109/AERO.2010.5446896","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Aerospace Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5440860/5446655/05446896.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"12","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/AERO.2010.5446896","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5446655","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5446896","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5446896/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-13 March 2010","displayDocTitle":"Reed-Solomon coding for free-space optical communications through turbulent atmosphere","conferenceDate":"6-13 March 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5446896/","dateOfInsertion":"15 April 2010","publicationDate":"March 2010","accessionNumber":"11258314","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reed-Solomon coding for free-space optical communications through turbulent atmosphere","confLoc":"Big Sky, MT, USA","sourcePdf":"z050302.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.099379S","chronDate":"6-13 March 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5440860","isNumber":"5446655","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5440860","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"5446655","articleId":"5446896","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5446899,"authors":[{"name":"Zhijun Zhao","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Michigan Technological University, Houghton, MI, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5440860/5446655/5446899/5446899-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Zhijun Zhao received his Ph.D. degree in Electrical Engineering from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Urbana, Illinois in 2006.

The on-off keying (OOK) method is used for laser beam modulation. The FSO communication channel is assumed to be shot-noise limited and experiences slowly time-varying power fading.

The optimal receiver aperture sizes to achieve the lowest average BER are determined.","doi":"10.1109/AERO.2010.5446899","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Aerospace Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Aerospace Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5440860/5446655/05446899.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/AERO.2010.5446899","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5446655","startPage":"1","endPage":"9","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Direct detection free-space optical communications through atmospheric turbulence","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5446899","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Direct detection free-space optical communications through atmospheric turbulence","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-13 March 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5446899/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"6-13 March 2010","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"March 2010","accessionNumber":"11258317","dateOfInsertion":"15 April 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5446899/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Direct detection free-space optical communications through atmospheric turbulence","confLoc":"Big Sky, MT, USA","sourcePdf":"z050301.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.093822S","chronDate":"6-13 March 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5440860","isNumber":"5446655","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5440860","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5446655","articleId":"5446899","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5446907,"authors":[{"name":"Yefim S.

Most of them are related to the necessity to accumulate signal energy in the capacitors of track-and-hold amplifiers (THAs) during a small fraction of the sampling interval. This limits the dynamic range and attainable bandwidth of software defined receivers (SDRs) and makes digitization close to the antenna impossible. Antialiasing filters used by conventional sampling limit adaptivity, reconfigurability, and scale of integration of SDRs. It is shown in this paper that development of sampling methods inevitably leads to the transition from the traditional interpretation of the sampling theorem to its new interpretation. It is also proven that the new interpretation directly follows from the sampling theorem. Novel sampling with internal antialiasing filtering based on the new interpretation accumulates the signal energy over several sampling intervals for each sample. This enables radical improvement of the SDR performance. The paper provides qualitative and quantitative estimation of advantages of the novel sampling for SDRs. Reconstruction of analog signals based on the new interpretation of the sampling theorem is also briefly discussed. An original approach to the analysis of the influence of nonideal integration on the transfer function of novel sampling circuits (NSCs) is presented.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5446655","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/AERO.2010.5446907","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Aerospace Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Aerospace Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5440860/5446655/05446907.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"20","doi":"10.1109/AERO.2010.5446907","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Theoretical basis and implementational challenges of sampling with internal filtering","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-13 March 2010","displayDocTitle":"Theoretical basis and implementational challenges of sampling with internal filtering","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"6-13 March 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5446907/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2010","accessionNumber":"11258325","dateOfInsertion":"15 April 2010","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5446907/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Theoretical basis and implementational challenges of sampling with internal filtering","confLoc":"Big Sky, MT, USA","sourcePdf":"z041204.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.098684S","chronDate":"6-13 March 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5440860","isNumber":"5446655","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5440860","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"5446655","articleId":"5446907","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":5446920,"authors":[{"name":"Mustafa Cenk Erturk","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of South Florida, Tampa, FL, USA"],"bio":{"p":["M.

This processing is performed subsequent to the radio frequency (RF) to intermediate frequency (IF) downconversion of the uplinked signals. Then, an analog-to-digital converter (ADC) is employed to convert the analog signals to digital signals. This conversion process can lead to spurious responses, which can act like tone interference to the uplinked modulated signals, including commonly employed quadrature phase-shift keying (QPSK) modulated signals. Additionally, there are a wide variety of other spurs that can be created by the satellite communication payload. All of these spurs can adversely affect bit error rate (BER) performance. This paper discusses the adverse effect such spurious responses have on QPSK modulated signals, and the spurs are modeled as tone interference. Results are presented, including BER curves, for the following: (1) the spur offset in frequency from the center frequency of the QPSK signal, (2) false lock of the receiver onto the spur frequency and phase, and (3) the addition of convolutional coding to the receiver and the improvement in BER that results.","doi":"10.1109/AERO.2010.5446921","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Aerospace Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Aerospace Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5440860/5446655/05446921.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/AERO.2010.5446921","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5446655","startPage":"1","endPage":"11","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Tone interference effects on the performance of QPSK modulation in communication","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5446921","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Tone interference effects on the performance of QPSK modulation in communication","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-13 March 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5446921/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"6-13 March 2010","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"March 2010","accessionNumber":"11258339","dateOfInsertion":"15 April 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5446921/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Tone interference effects on the performance of QPSK modulation in communication","confLoc":"Big Sky, MT, USA","sourcePdf":"z040906.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069542S","chronDate":"6-13 March 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5440860","isNumber":"5446655","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5440860","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5446655","articleId":"5446921","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5446927,"authors":[{"name":"Jon Hamkins","affiliation":["Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5440860/5446655/5446927/5446927-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jon Hamkins S'94, M'96, SM'03) received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering from the California Institute of Technology (Caltech), Pasadena, in 1990 and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical and computer engineering from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in 1993 and 1996, respectively.

The robust backup structure of these antennas, together with extremely large collecting apertures and milli-degree pointing capabilities suggest that dual RF/Optical communications may indeed be possible, at optical data-rates approaching 1 gigabit per second (GBPS) from typical Mars distances. Several design concepts have emerged as possible candidates, requiring modifications ranging from polishing and coating of the existing aluminum panels of the main reflector, to significant redesign involving replacement of the panels with optical reflectors. Optical receiver parameters such as collecting area, field-of-view (FOV), and immunity to reflected sunlight differ markedly for each design concept, hence will likely lead to different levels of performance in terms of data-throughput at a given BER, and in terms of the ability to point close to the sun. The communications performance of two candidate design concepts operating under realistic daytime conditions is evaluated, with particular emphasis on spatial and temporal acquisition algorithms and receiver optimization to achieve the best possible communication performance at high data rates.","doi":"10.1109/AERO.2010.5446955","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Aerospace Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Aerospace Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5440860/5446655/05446955.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/AERO.2010.5446955","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5446655","startPage":"1","endPage":"13","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optical communications performance of hybrid 34-meter microwave antennas","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5446955","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Optical communications performance of hybrid 34-meter microwave antennas","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-13 March 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5446955/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"6-13 March 2010","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"March 2010","accessionNumber":"11258373","dateOfInsertion":"15 April 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5446955/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optical communications performance of hybrid 34-meter microwave antennas","confLoc":"Big Sky, MT, USA","sourcePdf":"z040103.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.110729S","chronDate":"6-13 March 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5440860","isNumber":"5446655","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5440860","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"5446655","articleId":"5446955","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5446965,"authors":[{"name":"Suzanna Denton","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, CA, USA","Northrop Grumman Information Systems, San Diego, CA, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Suzanna Denton is a Systems Engineer at Northrop Grumman Corporation; she has directed many front-end system engineering and requirements efforts for various programs.

The resulting signal spatial structure and signal gain observed from the mobile users is significantly degraded due to other interfering signals and potential jammers.

This paper will investigate using adaptive beamforming algorithms as a front-end solution for interference rejection for a high flying airborne platform outfitted with a conventional CDMA system.

The convergence of the LLMS algorithm is analyzed, in terms of mean square error, in the presence of Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) for two different operation modes; normal referencing and self-referencing. Computer simulation results show that the convergence performance of LLMS is superior to the conventional LMS algorithms as well some of the more recent LMS based algorithms, such as constrained-stability LMS (CSLMS), and Modified Robust Variable Step Size LMS (MRVSS) algorithms. It is shown that the convergence of LLMS is quite insensitive to variations in both the input signal-to-noise ratio and the step size used. Also, the operation of the proposed algorithm remains stable even when its reference signal is corrupted by AWGN noise. Furthermore, the fidelity of the signal at the output of the LLMS beamformer is demonstrated through the Error Vector Magnitude (EVM) and the scatter plot obtained.","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Aerospace Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5440860/5446655/05446967.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"10","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Aerospace Conference","doi":"10.1109/AERO.2010.5446967","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/AERO.2010.5446967","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5446655","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5446967","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive array beamforming using a combined LMS-LMS algorithm","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Adaptive arrays","Array signal processing","Least squares approximation","Convergence","AWGN","Additive white noise","Adaptive algorithm","Application software","Algorithm design and analysis","Mean square error methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","array signal processing","AWGN","least mean squares methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive array beamforming","combined LMS-LMS algorithm","least mean square sections","mean square error","additive white Gaussian noise","AWGN","normal referencing","self-referencing","computer simulation","constrained-stability LMS","modified robust variable step size LMS","error vector magnitude"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5446967/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-13 March 2010","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive array beamforming using a combined LMS-LMS algorithm","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5446967/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2010","accessionNumber":"11258385","dateOfInsertion":"15 April 2010","conferenceDate":"6-13 March 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive array beamforming using a combined LMS-LMS algorithm","confLoc":"Big Sky, MT, USA","sourcePdf":"z030107.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.074713S","chronDate":"6-13 March 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5440860","isNumber":"5446655","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5440860","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"5446655","articleId":"5446967","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5446968,"authors":[{"name":"Raymond J.

The algorithm is based on a joint implementation of the conjugate gradient (CG) multistage Wiener filter (MWF), called the CG-MWF. This algorithm is more robust in a multiuser environment than its single user and full rank counterparts, as well as more efficient to implement, in that it requires a very low rank to adapt the beamformer weights. Multiple signals are assumed, which produce a co-channel interference (CCI) scenario. We show that the algorithm provides up to 7 dB improvement over the single user CG-MWF when the power levels of the users are similar. We demonstrate the robustness of the algorithm under dynamic conditions, such as when the number of users, their powers, and their directions-of-arrival (DoAs) change or when a user is traveling at driving speeds.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5446971/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-13 March 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2010","dateOfInsertion":"15 April 2010","accessionNumber":"11258389","htmlLink":"/document/5446971/","conferenceDate":"6-13 March 2010","displayDocTitle":"Beamforming for IEEE 802.11b using a joint conjugate gradient multistage wiener filter.","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Beamforming for IEEE 802.11b using a joint conjugate gradient multistage wiener filter.","confLoc":"Big Sky, MT, USA","sourcePdf":"z030102.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051953S","chronDate":"6-13 March 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5440860","isNumber":"5446655","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5440860","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5446655","articleId":"5446971","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5446998,"authors":[{"name":"Sandeep Mukherjee","affiliation":["University of Roma Tor Vergata, Italy"],"bio":{"p":["Sandeep Mukherjee received his B.

We put special emphasis on the generality of the VI framework, showing how it allows to tackle several interesting problems in nonlinear analysis, classical optimization, and equilibrium programming. In particular, we showed the relevance of the VI theory in studying Nash and GNE problems. The first part of the article was devoted to provide the (basic) theoretical tools and methods to analyze some fundamental issues of an equilibrium problem, such as the existence and uniqueness of a solution and the design of iterative distributed algorithms along with their convergence properties. The second part of the article made these theoretical results practical by showing how the VI framework can be successfully applied to solve several challenging equilibrium problems in ad hoc wireless (peer-to-peer wired) networks, in the emerging field of CR networks, and in multihop communication networks. We hope that this introductory article would serve as a good starting point for readers to apply VI theory and methods in their applications, as well as to locate specific references either in applications or theory.","doi":"10.1109/MSP.2010.936021","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MSP.2010.936021","startPage":"35","endPage":"49","publicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Magazine","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel5/79/5447048/05447064.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5447048","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Convex Optimization, Game Theory, and Variational Inequality Theory","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5447064/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 April 2010","displayDocTitle":"Convex Optimization, Game Theory, and Variational Inequality Theory","volume":"27","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"15 April 2010","accessionNumber":"11243433","publicationDate":"May 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5447064/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Convex Optimization, Game Theory, and Variational Inequality Theory","sourcePdf":"27msp03-scutari.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.126799S","chronDate":"May  2010","xplore-pub-id":"79","isNumber":"5447048","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"79","citationCount":"175","xplore-issue":"5447048","articleId":"5447064","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-21"},{"_id":5447065,"authors":[{"name":"John Mattingley","affiliation":["Information System Laboratory, University of Stanford, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Jacob Mattingley (jacobm@stanford.edu) is an electrical engineering Ph.D. student at the Information Systems Laboratory at Stanford University.

As we have argued herein, when those properties lie in a rich class of design criteria that are convex in the design variables, the inherent tradeoffs between these properties, and filters that attain these tradeoffs, can be reliably obtained. Furthermore, some recently developed software provides a platform that enables these tradeoffs to be obtained with little programming effort. In our examples we only considered pair-wise tradeoffs, but the extension to tradeoff surfaces in higher dimensions is straightforward, even though they tend to be more difficult to visualize. Moreover, the general-purpose convex design platform provides the flexibility to combine convex design criteria in a variety of ways. This platform also offers the opportunity to develop customized algorithms that exploit the structure of particular classes of FIR filter design problems.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5447048","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MSP.2010.936040","publicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Magazine","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel5/79/5447048/05447080.pdf","startPage":"89","endPage":"101","doi":"10.1109/MSP.2010.936040","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Enriching the Art of FIR Filter Design via Convex Optimization","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2010","displayDocTitle":"Enriching the Art of FIR Filter Design via Convex Optimization","volume":"27","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/5447080/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May 2010","accessionNumber":"11243442","dateOfInsertion":"15 April 2010","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5447080/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 April 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Enriching the Art of FIR Filter Design via Convex Optimization","sourcePdf":"27msp03-davidson.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.189887S","chronDate":"May  2010","xplore-pub-id":"79","isNumber":"5447048","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"79","citationCount":"38","xplore-issue":"5447048","articleId":"5447080","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":5447084,"authors":[{"name":"Kilian Q.

The representation of the data plays an important role in determining what types of patterns can be automatically discovered. Many algorithms for machine learning assume that the data are represented as elements in a metric space. The performance of these algorithms can depend sensitively on the manner in which distances are measured. When data are represented as points in a multidimensional vector space, simple Euclidean distances are often used to measure the dissimilarity between different examples. However, such distances often do not yield reliable judgments; in addition, they cannot highlight the distinctive features that play a role in certain types of classification, but not others. Naturally, for different types of clustering, different ways of measuring dissimilarity were needed. In particular, different metrics for computing distances between feature vectors. This paper describes two algorithms for learning such distance metrics based on recent developments in convex optimization.","doi":"10.1109/MSP.2010.936013","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MSP.2010.936013","startPage":"146","endPage":"158","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel5/79/5447048/05447084.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Magazine","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5447048","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Convex Optimizations for Distance Metric Learning and Pattern Classification [Applications Corner]","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 April 2010","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2010","displayDocTitle":"Convex Optimizations for Distance Metric Learning and Pattern Classification [Applications Corner]","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2010","dateOfInsertion":"15 April 2010","volume":"27","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5447084/","accessionNumber":"11243443","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5447084/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Convex Optimizations for Distance Metric Learning and Pattern Classification [Applications Corner]","sourcePdf":"27msp03-applications.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.064023S","chronDate":"May  2010","xplore-pub-id":"79","isNumber":"5447048","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"79","citationCount":"28","xplore-issue":"5447048","articleId":"5447084","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":5447114,"authors":[{"name":"Michael Zibulevsky","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Technion-Israel Institute of Technology, Israel"],"bio":{"p":["Michael Zibulevsky (mzib@cs.technion.ac.il) received his M.Sc. degree in electrical engineering from MIIT, Moscow, and the D.Sc. degree in operations research (nonlinear optimization) from Technion, Israel, in 1996.

Simulation results are presented to confirm the computed asymptotic thresholds.","publicationTitle":"2010 International ITG Conference on Source and Channel Coding (SCC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 International ITG Conference on Source and Channel Coding (SCC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5440858/5447116/05447121.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5447116","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Density evolution analysis of Protograph-based braided block codes on the erasure channel","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5447121/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 Jan. 2010","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Density evolution analysis of Protograph-based braided block codes on the erasure channel","conferenceDate":"18-21 Jan. 2010","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"15 April 2010","publicationDate":"Jan. 2010","accessionNumber":"11243928","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5447121/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Density evolution analysis of Protograph-based braided block codes on the erasure channel","confLoc":"Siegen, Germany","sourcePdf":"33Lentmaier.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060218S","chronDate":"18-21 Jan. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5440858","isNumber":"5447116","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5440858","xplore-issue":"5447116","articleId":"5447121","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"VDE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":5447122,"authors":[{"name":"Mark Petermann","affiliation":["Department of Communications Engineering, University of Brethemen, Bremen, Germany"],"firstName":"Mark","lastName":"Petermann","id":"37400382600"},{"name":"Dirk W\u00fcbben","affiliation":["Department of Communications Engineering, University of Brethemen, Bremen, Germany"],"firstName":"Dirk","lastName":"W\u00fcbben","id":"37269338400"},{"name":"Karl-Dirk Kammeyer","affiliation":["Department of Communications Engineering, University of Brethemen, Bremen, Germany"],"firstName":"Karl-Dirk","lastName":"Kammeyer","id":"37270666500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6872-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-3-8007-3211-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5447122","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":214},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Calibration","Transceivers","Robustness","Filters","OFDM","Forward error correction","Base stations","Downlink","Niobium","Channel state information"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["equalisers","error statistics","forward error correction","multiuser channels","OFDM modulation","time division multiplexing","transceivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["TDD mode","nonideal channel reciprocity","multiuser orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","time division duplex mode downlink preequalization","channel state information","calibration","uplink-downlink link equivalence","MU-MISO-OFDM system","nonlinear preequalization","forward error correction","coded bit error rate","transceiver mismatch"]}],"abstract":"In multi-user orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (MU-OFDM) systems operating in time division duplex (TDD) mode downlink pre-equalization can be applied relying on channel state information (CSI) from the uplink direction. Unfortunately, the prerequisite of channel reciprocity is usually not fulfilled due to non-reciprocal transceivers. Hence, this paper deals with a comparison of robust pre-equalization schemes and a calibration approach to enhance the necessary uplink-downlink link equivalence for MU-MISO-OFDM systems applying linear and non-linear pre-equalization techniques and strong forward error correction (FEC). Performance evaluations concerning coded bit error rate results show that robust pre-equalizers exclusively improve the performance in moderate non-reciprocity conditions.

Cole et al, show a fast frame error rate simulation method of LDPC codes by applying importance sampling (IS). At first, we extend Cole et aI.'s method to the BER estimation of LDPC codes. Since the simulation time of the BER evaluation version of the Cole et aI.'s method is proportional to the number of total dominant trapping sets used in the simulation, we should appropriately choose the dominant trapping sets to reduce the simulation time. To avoid the difficulty, we propose another simulation method, which selects a dominant trapping set as proportional to its upper bound.

In this work, simple helper nodes creating artificial noise are applied to improve the secrecy of a point-to-point link. In the single-antenna case, the channel parameters and SNR determine whether a helper can increase the secrecy capacity. We derive a necessary and sufficient condition for optimality of a helper. The single-antenna helper provides only limited support for the single-antenna link. Therefore, we compute the optimal beamforming vectors of the transmitter in closed form for the multiple antenna link under ideal assumption of perfectly informed transmitters. The optimal beamforming vectors of the helpers are characterized and an algorithm is proposed which jointly optimizes transmitter and helper beamformers. It is shown that with increasing number of helpers the secrecy capacity approaches the capacity of the peaceful multiple-antenna link without secrecy constraints. Finally, numerical simulations illustrate the secrecy capacity gain by these simple helpers.","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 International ITG Conference on Source and Channel Coding (SCC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5440858/5447116/05447128.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5447116","publicationTitle":"2010 International ITG Conference on Source and Channel Coding (SCC)","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Secrecy capacity of single- and multi-antenna channels with simple helpers","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5447128","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 Jan. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Secrecy capacity of single- and multi-antenna channels with simple helpers","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5447128/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5447128/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2010","accessionNumber":"11243935","dateOfInsertion":"15 April 2010","conferenceDate":"18-21 Jan. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Secrecy capacity of single- and multi-antenna channels with simple helpers","confLoc":"Siegen, Germany","sourcePdf":"29Jorswieck.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049415S","chronDate":"18-21 Jan. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5440858","isNumber":"5447116","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5440858","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"5447116","articleId":"5447128","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"VDE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5447130,"authors":[{"name":"Stefan Nowak","affiliation":["Communication Technology Institute, Department of Electrical Engineering and Information Technology, Dortmund University, Dortmund, Germany"],"firstName":"Stefan","lastName":"Nowak","id":"37396426300"},{"name":"R\u00fcdiger Kays","affiliation":["Communication Technology Institute, Department of Electrical Engineering and Information Technology, Dortmund University, Dortmund, Germany"],"firstName":"R\u00fcdiger","lastName":"Kays","id":"37267615100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6872-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-3-8007-3211-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5447130","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":470},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5447130","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interleaved codes","Parity check codes","Modulation coding","Iterative decoding","Forward error correction","Communications technology","Rayleigh channels","Error correction codes","Wireless LAN","Information technology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["AWGN channels","binary codes","decoding","interleaved codes","iterative methods","parity check codes","quadrature amplitude modulation","Rayleigh channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["interleaving scheme","binary LDPC coded higher-order modulation","low- density parity-check coded modulation","AWGN","Rayleigh channels","higher-order modulation","unequal error protection","bit node","decoding process","iterations","256-QAM","Gray mapping","IEEE 802.11","signal-to-noise ratios"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["BICM","Low-density parity-check codes","Higher-order modulation","Interleaving"]}],"abstract":"This paper addresses bit-interleaving for low-density parity-check (LDPC) coded modulation in AWGN and Rayleigh channels.

This paper deals with the application of bipartite graphs to a different problem. More specifically, the bipartite graph description is applied to the iterative interference cancelation process of a recently introduced random access scheme named contention resolution diversity slotted ALOHA. Contention resolution diversity slotted ALOHA relies on MAC bursts repetition and on interference cancelation to increase the throughput of a classic slotted ALOHA access scheme. The graph representation permits to establish a bridge between the iterative interference cancelation process and the iterative erasure recovery process of graph-based codes. Assuming ideal interference cancelation, it is shown how the use of irregular bipartite graphs allows achieving a throughput close to 0.97 packets/slot with a maximum burst repetition rate equal to 16. The iterative interference cancelation analysis is further extended to the case of non-ideal interference cancelation. A discussion on the normalized efficiency is provided as well, considering the average power used by the different approaches.","pdfPath":"/iel5/5440858/5447116/05447152.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 International ITG Conference on Source and Channel Coding (SCC)","publicationTitle":"2010 International ITG Conference on Source and Channel Coding (SCC)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5447116","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A slotted ALOHA scheme based on bipartite graph optimization","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5447152/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 Jan. 2010","displayDocTitle":"A slotted ALOHA scheme based on bipartite graph optimization","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"15 April 2010","accessionNumber":"11243959","publicationDate":"Jan. 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5447152/","conferenceDate":"18-21 Jan. 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A slotted ALOHA scheme based on bipartite graph optimization","confLoc":"Siegen, Germany","sourcePdf":"08Liva.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.095267S","chronDate":"18-21 Jan. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5440858","isNumber":"5447116","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5440858","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5447116","articleId":"5447152","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"VDE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":5447211,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaocui Lou","affiliation":["Math. & Syst.

The proposed technique is a new model of encoding that results as transforming no more than twelve zero and processing information which are all in low PAPR according to the principle of coding method proposed in the book of OFDM[2]. The obtained results show that this pre-coding method is not only reducing the PAPR with low complexity, also has well performance in Bit Error Rate(BER) since it has no effect on the magnitude.

It has been one of the most hot research topics. Now many corporations have involved in the cloud computing related techniques and many cloud computing platforms have been put forward. This is a favorable situation to study and application of cloud computing related techniques. Though interesting, there are also some problems for so many flatforms. For to a novice or user with little knowledge about cloud computing, it is still very hard to make a reasonable choice.

A set of monocular stereo system which uses a five-dimensional manipulator carrying a CCD camera was established on the NC milling machine. Projective rectification was used to stereo match in virtue of dimension reduction of match search. 3D reconstruction of the on-machine workpiece are carried out including steps of system calibration, projective rectification, image transformation, image matching and depth calculation. The application results show that this method can make full use of digital controlled machine tool feed movements to realize the measuring and manufacturing integration.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Second International Symposium on Information Science and Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/5446611/5447160/05447246.pdf","startPage":"392","endPage":"395","publicationTitle":"2009 Second International Symposium on Information Science and Engineering","doi":"10.1109/ISISE.2009.12","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISISE.2009.12","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5447160","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5447246","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On-Machine 3D Reconstruction Using Monocular Stereo Vision System","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Stereo vision","Image reconstruction","Reconstruction algorithms","Charge coupled devices","Charge-coupled image sensors","Metalworking machines","Stereo image processing","Calibration","Image matching","Digital control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CCD image sensors","image matching","manipulators","milling machines","robot vision","stereo image processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["monocular stereo vision system","CCD camera","NC milling machine","system calibration","projective rectification","image transformation","image matching","digital controlled machine tool","onmachine 3D reconstruction method"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["3D Reconstruction","on-machine workpiece","monocular stereo vision","projective rectification"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5447246/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-28 Dec. 2009","displayDocTitle":"On-Machine 3D Reconstruction Using Monocular Stereo Vision System","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5447246/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","accessionNumber":"11244988","dateOfInsertion":"15 April 2010","conferenceDate":"26-28 Dec. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On-Machine 3D Reconstruction Using Monocular Stereo Vision System","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"3991a392.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050814S","chronDate":"26-28 Dec. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5446611","isNumber":"5447160","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5446611","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5447160","articleId":"5447246","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5447302,"authors":[{"name":"Yuxiang Li","affiliation":["Coll. of Sci., Harbin Eng.

One solution is to execute code from a secondary memory, cheaper, denser, but slower, such as NAND Flash. Solutions based on Demand-Paging and using a cache in main memory, began to be proposed and implemented in the domain of mobile phones, but consume too much RAM yet, compared to what can provide a smart card. In this paper, we show that we can dramatically increase performance by reducing the size of pages in the cache. This solution then allows a more intelligent access to the NAND. We also show that our solution allows to use Demand-Paging within limits of smart cards memories, where a conventional approach, offering too low bandwidth, makes impossible code execution from this kind of secondary memory.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5447502/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-18 Feb. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"Feb. 2010","accessionNumber":"11258994","htmlLink":"/document/5447502/","dateOfInsertion":"15 April 2010","conferenceDate":"15-18 Feb. 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Impact of Pages Sizes to Execute Code Using Demand Paging and NAND Flash at Smart Card Scale","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Impact of Pages Sizes to Execute Code Using Demand Paging and NAND Flash at Smart Card Scale","confLoc":"Krakow, Poland","sourcePdf":"3967a794.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06523S","chronDate":"15-18 Feb. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5446610","isNumber":"5447239","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5446610","xplore-issue":"5447239","articleId":"5447502","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5447510,"authors":[{"name":"W.T.

Content of interest is filtered using a collection of binary classifiers that are deployed on distributed resource-constrained infrastructure. In this paper, we focus on selecting the optimal topology (chain) of classifiers, and present algorithms for classifier ordering and configuration, to tradeoff accuracy of feature identification with filtering delay. The order selection is dependent on the data characteristics, system resource constraints as well as the performance and complexity characteristics of each classifier. We first develop centralized algorithms for joint ordering and individual classifier operating point selection. We then propose a decentralized approach and use reinforcement learning methods to design a dynamic routing based order selection strategy. We investigate different learning strategies that lead to rapid convergence, while requiring minimum coordination and message exchange.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4200690/5464447/05447618.pdf","startPage":"620","endPage":"636","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/JSTSP.2009.2039180","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSTSP.2009.2039180","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5464447","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5447618","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive Topologic Optimization for Large-Scale Stream Mining","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Large-scale systems","Streaming media","Information retrieval","Topology","Filtering algorithms","Delay","Learning","Design methodology","Routing","Convergence"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data mining","learning (artificial intelligence)","optimisation","pattern classification","topology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive topologic optimization","large-scale stream mining","large scale multimedia analysis","binary classifier","feature identification","filtering delay","reinforcement learning","centralized algorithms","classifier ordering","classifier configuration","dynamic routing","order selection strategy"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Classifier topology construction","large-scale stream mining","multi-concept detection","optimization"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5447618/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 April 2010","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive Topologic Optimization for Large-Scale Stream Mining","volume":"4","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/5447618/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2010","accessionNumber":"11293219","dateOfInsertion":"13 May 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive Topologic Optimization for Large-Scale Stream Mining","sourcePdf":"jstsp-turaga-2039180-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.121592S","chronDate":"June  2010","xplore-pub-id":"4200690","isNumber":"5464447","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4200690","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"5464447","articleId":"5447618","onlineDate":"15 April 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5447621,"authors":[{"name":"Christian D.

In sparse reconstruction, one wishes to recover a sparse amplitude vector from a measurement that is described as a linear combination of a small number of discrete additive components. Recent results in the compressive sensing literature have provided fast sparse reconstruction algorithms with guaranteed performance bounds for problems with certain structure. In this paper, we show an explicit connection between sparse reconstruction and parameter/order estimation and demonstrate how sparse reconstruction may be used to solve model order selection and parameter estimation problems. The structural assumption used in compressive sensing to guarantee reconstruction performance-the Restricted Isometry Property-is not satisfied in the general parameter estimation context. Nonetheless, we develop a method for selecting sparsity parameters such that sparse reconstruction mimics classic order selection criteria such as Akaike information criterion (AIC) and Bayesian information criterion (BIC). We compare the performance of the sparse reconstruction approach with traditional model order selection/parameter estimation techniques for a sinusoids-in-noise example. We find that the two methods have comparable performance in most cases, and that sparse linear modeling performs better than traditional model-based parameter/order estimation for closely spaced sinusoids with low signal-to-noise ratio.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the Relation Between Sparse Reconstruction and Parameter Estimation With Model Order Selection","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/JSTSP.2009.2038313","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4200690/5464447/05447621.pdf","startPage":"560","endPage":"570","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSTSP.2009.2038313","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5464447","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5447621","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5447621/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 April 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2010","displayDocTitle":"On the Relation Between Sparse Reconstruction and Parameter Estimation With Model Order Selection","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"4","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/5447621/","dateOfInsertion":"13 May 2010","publicationDate":"June 2010","accessionNumber":"11293218","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the Relation Between Sparse Reconstruction and Parameter Estimation With Model Order Selection","sourcePdf":"04jstsp03-caustin-2038313.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.078476S","chronDate":"June  2010","xplore-pub-id":"4200690","isNumber":"5464447","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4200690","citationCount":"56","xplore-issue":"5464447","articleId":"5447621","onlineDate":"15 April 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5447627,"authors":[{"name":"Jaime De La Ree","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, Virginia Technology, Blacksburg, VA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5165411/5467281/5447627/5447627-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jaime De La Ree (S'80\u2013M'80\u2013SM'94) received the B.S.E.E. degree with honors from The Instituto Tecnologico y de Estudios Superiores de Monterrey in 1980 and the M.S.E.E. and Ph.D. degree from University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA, in 1981 and 1984 respectively.","In 1984, he joined the ECE Department at Virginia Tech, Blacksburg, where he is currently the Associate Department Head.

However, the four times oversampling process increases the computational complexity. In this paper, we propose a new low-complexity method to efficiently estimate the PAPR value of the OFDM signal. The proposed scheme uses an interpolator to find the peak of the four times oversampled OFDM signal around some searched samples of the original discrete-time OFDM signal using oversampling with a factor lower than four. Some criteria are derived to determine the interpolation filter length and the threshold of sample power for the search process. As compared to the method with four times oversampling, the proposed PAPR estimation scheme achieves close performance with only about half of the computational complexity. It is also shown that the proposed approach can easily be combined with the selected mapping method for PAPR reduction, where the complexity is significantly reduced but the performance is degraded only slightly.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4200690/5464447/05447638.pdf","startPage":"637","endPage":"645","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/JSTSP.2009.2038311","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSTSP.2009.2038311","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5464447","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5447638","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Low-Complexity PAPR Estimation Scheme for OFDM Signals and Its Application to SLM-Based PAPR Reduction","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Peak to average power ratio","OFDM","Interpolation","Signal processing","Filters","Digital video broadcasting","Frequency estimation","Computational complexity","Vehicular and wireless technologies","Wireless LAN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["estimation theory","OFDM modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["low-complexity PAPR estimation scheme","OFDM signals","SLM-based PAPR Reduction","peak-to-average power ratio reduction methods","low-complexity method"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Interpolator","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM)","peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) estimation","PAPR reduction","selected mapping (SLM)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5447638/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 April 2010","displayDocTitle":"A Low-Complexity PAPR Estimation Scheme for OFDM Signals and Its Application to SLM-Based PAPR Reduction","volume":"4","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/5447638/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2010","accessionNumber":"11293205","dateOfInsertion":"13 May 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Low-Complexity PAPR Estimation Scheme for OFDM Signals and Its Application to SLM-Based PAPR Reduction","sourcePdf":"jstsp-wang-2038311-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.078386S","chronDate":"June  2010","xplore-pub-id":"4200690","isNumber":"5464447","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4200690","citationCount":"26","xplore-issue":"5464447","articleId":"5447638","onlineDate":"15 April 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5447639,"authors":[{"name":"Raj Rao Nadakuditi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4200690/5464447/5447639/5447639-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Raj Rao Nadakuditi received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering from Lafayette College, Easton, PA, in 1999, and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering and oceanographic engineering from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution Joint Program in Applied Ocean Science and Engineering in 2001 and 2007, respectively.","He joined the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, in September 2009, where he is currently an Assistant Professor.

This problem arises in the context of applications as diverse as radar, sonar, wireless communications, bioinformatics, and machine learning and is the critical first step in the subsequent signal parameter estimation phase. The signal detection problem can be naturally posed in terms of the sample generalized eigenvalues. The sample generalized eigenvalues correspond to the eigenvalues of the matrix formed by ?whitening? the signal-plus-noise sample covariance matrix with the noise-only sample covariance matrix. In this paper, we prove a fundamental asymptotic limit of sample generalized eigenvalue-based detection of signals in arbitrarily colored noise when there are relatively few signal bearing and noise-only samples. Specifically, we show why when the (eigen) signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is below a critical value, that is a simple function of n , m, and N, then reliable signal detection, in an asymptotic sense, is not possible. If, however, the eigen-SNR is above this critical value then a simple, new random matrix theory-based algorithm, which we present here, will reliably detect the signal even at SNRs close to the critical value.

Residuals are synthesized by using nonlinear observers followed from a directional characterization. First, it is observed that the IM model can be written in a recurrent decoupled structure by taking the stator currents and mechanical velocity as outputs. In this way, residuals can be insensitive to load torque and operating conditions, and simultaneous faults can be addressed. A pulsewidth modulation three-phase inverter is studied as power actuator for the IM. Hence, in order to isolate faults related to the six switching devices, a directional residual evaluation in the -frame is employed. Hence, three residuals are constructed to isolate the faulty switches.

The coverage range of UWB systems is then confined to within a few meters. Dual-hop relaying or multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) technology is one possible way of achieving greater UWB system coverage. This paper presents the design of dual-hop UWB MIMO relay systems (in which a source, relay, and destination have multiple antennas) according to the availability of channel state information (CSI) and their performance analysis over a UWB multipath fading channel. In particular, the decouple-and-forward and decode-and-forward relay systems are proposed when partial CSI is only available at the receiver side. On the other hand, with partial CSI being available at the transmitter side, we propose the amplify-and-forward and detect-and-forward relay systems. The exact formulas for the outage probabilities of those systems are derived. Furthermore, we evaluate, in closed form, the amount of fading and bit error rate expressions under sufficiently high signal-to-noise ratio and verify them through comparison with the simulation results. The effect of spatial correlation on the performance of our proposed systems is also studied. Numerical examples of the results provide valuable insights into the design of UWB MIMO relay systems.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2010.2048347","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/5508587/05447688.pdf","startPage":"2906","endPage":"2920","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2010.2048347","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5508587","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design and Performance of Dual-Hop MIMO UWB Transmissions","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5447688","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 April 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5447688/","displayDocTitle":"Design and Performance of Dual-Hop MIMO UWB Transmissions","volume":"59","issue":"6","publicationDate":"July 2010","accessionNumber":"11464869","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5447688/","dateOfInsertion":"12 July 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design and Performance of Dual-Hop MIMO UWB Transmissions","sourcePdf":"tvt-maichalernnukul-2048347-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.120576S","chronDate":"July  2010","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"5508587","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"5508587","articleId":"5447688","onlineDate":"15 April 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5447689,"authors":[{"name":"Lingyang Song","affiliation":["Peking University, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/5508587/5447689/5447689-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Lingyang Song (M\u201909) received the B.S. degree in communication engineering from Jilin University, Changchun, China, in 2002 and the Ph.D. degree in differential space\u2013time codes and multiple-input\u2013multiple-output from the University of York, York, U.K., in 2007.","He was a Postdoctoral Research Fellow with the University of Oslo, Oslo, Norway, until rejoining Philips Research U.K. in March 2008.

A joint relay-selection and analog-network coding using differential modulation (RS-ANC-DM) is proposed. In the proposed scheme, the two sources employ differential modulations and transmit the differential modulated symbols to all relays at the same time. The signal received at the relay is a superposition of two transmitted symbols, which we call analog network-coded symbols. Then, a single relay that has minimum-sum symbol error rate (SER) is selected out of \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">N</i>\n relays to forward the ANC signals to both sources. To facilitate the selection process, in this paper, we also propose a simple suboptimal Min-Max criterion for relay selection, where a single relay that minimizes the maximum SER of two source nodes is selected. Simulation results show that the proposed Min-Max selection has almost the same performance as the optimal selection but is much simpler. The performance of the proposed RS-ANC-DM scheme is analyzed, and a simple asymptotic SER expression is derived. The analytical results are verified through simulations.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5447689/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 April 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"59","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2010","dateOfInsertion":"12 July 2010","accessionNumber":"11464866","htmlLink":"/document/5447689/","displayDocTitle":"Joint Relay Selection and Analog Network Coding Using Differential Modulation in Two-Way Relay Channels","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint Relay Selection and Analog Network Coding Using Differential Modulation in Two-Way Relay Channels","sourcePdf":"tvt-song-2048225-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.133439S","chronDate":"July  2010","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"5508587","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"90","xplore-issue":"5508587","articleId":"5447689","onlineDate":"15 April 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5447699,"authors":[{"name":"Clive Cheong Took","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Imperial College London, London, UK"],"firstName":"Clive","lastName":"Cheong Took","id":"37392028300"},{"name":"Danilo P.

Analog beamformers operating in the RF domain can reduce the number of antenna signals to a feasible number of baseband channels. Subsequently, digital beamforming is used to capture the desired user signal. In this paper, we consider the design of the analog and digital beamforming coefficients, for the case of narrowband signals. We aim to cancel interfering signals in the analog domain, thus minimizing the required ADC resolution. For a given resolution, we will propose the optimal analog beamformer to minimize the mean squared error between the desired user and its receiver estimate. Practical analog beamformers employ only a quantized number of phase shifts. For this case, we propose a design technique to successively approximate the desired overall beamformer by a linear combination of implementable analog beamformers. Finally, an online channel estimation technique is introduced to estimate the required statistics of the wireless channel on which the optimal beamformers are based.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2010.2048321","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5508649","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2010.2048321","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/5508649/05447703.pdf","startPage":"4131","endPage":"4143","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analog Beamforming in MIMO Communications With Phase Shift Networks and Online Channel Estimation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 April 2010","displayDocTitle":"Analog Beamforming in MIMO Communications With Phase Shift Networks and Online Channel Estimation","volume":"58","issue":"8","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2010","dateOfInsertion":"12 July 2010","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5447703/","publicationDate":"Aug. 2010","accessionNumber":"11465460","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5447703/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analog Beamforming in MIMO Communications With Phase Shift Networks and Online Channel Estimation","sourcePdf":"tsp-vvenkateswaran-2048321-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.081193S","chronDate":"Aug.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"5508649","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"260","xplore-issue":"5508649","articleId":"5447703","onlineDate":"15 April 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5447704,"authors":[{"name":"Takao Matsumoto","affiliation":["Graduate School of Science and Technology, Kumamoto University, Kumamoto, Japan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/27/5596160/5447704/5447704-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Takao Matsumoto (M'09) was born in Fukuoka, Japan, on September 21, 1984.

Since a pulsewidth of applied voltage has a strong influence on the energy efficiency of the removal of pollutants, the development of a short-pulse generator is of paramount importance for practical applications. In this paper, a nanosecond (ns) pulse generator which has a 5-ns pulse duration in output pulsed voltage is developed, and NO-removal experiments using ns pulsed discharge were conducted. The experimental results of the NO removal showed 100% of NO-removal ratio at 7 pps of pulse repetition rate and the extremely high energy efficiency, which is 0.43 mol/kWh (12.9 g-NO/kWh) for NO removal (initial NO concentration = 200 ppm; gas flow = 2.0 l/min ). The result of deriving energy efficiency for NO removal indicated that the ns pulsed discharge has great advantage in energy efficiency for NO removal to the conventional discharge methods. By this research, the utility of the ns pulse plasma process was proven, and the influence of shorter pulse duration on NO-removal energy efficiency was confirmed.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5596160","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPS.2010.2045903","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Plasma Science","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Plasma Science","pdfPath":"/iel5/27/5596160/05447704.pdf","startPage":"2639","endPage":"2643","doi":"10.1109/TPS.2010.2045903","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Energy Efficiency Improvement of Nitric Oxide Treatment Using Nanosecond Pulsed Discharge","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2010","displayDocTitle":"Energy Efficiency Improvement of Nitric Oxide Treatment Using Nanosecond Pulsed Discharge","volume":"38","issue":"10","htmlLink":"/document/5447704/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","accessionNumber":"11574175","dateOfInsertion":"07 October 2010","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5447704/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 April 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy Efficiency Improvement of Nitric Oxide Treatment Using Nanosecond Pulsed Discharge","sourcePdf":"tps-matsumoto-2045903-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.095598S","chronDate":"Oct.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"27","isNumber":"5596160","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"27","citationCount":"66","xplore-issue":"5596160","articleId":"5447704","onlineDate":"15 April 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-12"},{"_id":5447711,"authors":[{"name":"Maxim Kuschnerov","affiliation":["University of Federal Armed Forces Munich, Neubiberg, Germany"],"firstName":"Maxim","lastName":"Kuschnerov","id":"37314128800"},{"name":"M.

Next-generation systems will require a scalable and modular design for higher order modulation formats. Due to the nature of the fiber channel and the required parallelization in high-speed receivers, data-aided and blind algorithms call for a general reassessment when used in coherent optic receivers employing higher order modulation formats. In this paper, blind and data-aided receivers are compared for coherent single-carrier optical systems in terms of complexity, tracking ability, and convergence speed. Methods for equalization are discussed for time-domain- and frequency-domain-based receivers covering the most important algorithms. The general superiority of data-aided frequency-domain equalization is demonstrated.","doi":"10.1109/JPHOT.2010.2048308","publicationTitle":"IEEE Photonics Journal","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Photonics Journal","pdfPath":"/iel5/4563994/5473176/05447711.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JPHOT.2010.2048308","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5473176","startPage":"387","endPage":"403","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Data-Aided Versus Blind Single-Carrier Coherent Receivers","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5447711","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Data-Aided Versus Blind Single-Carrier Coherent Receivers","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5447711/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 April 2010","isJournal":true,"isOpenAccess":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"2","issue":"3","publicationDate":"June 2010","accessionNumber":"11328476","dateOfInsertion":"01 June 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5447711/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Data-Aided Versus Blind Single-Carrier Coherent Receivers","sourcePdf":"jphot-kuschnerov-2048308.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.13253S","chronDate":"June  2010","xplore-pub-id":"4563994","isNumber":"5473176","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4563994","citationCount":"80","xplore-issue":"5473176","articleId":"5447711","onlineDate":"15 April 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5447730,"authors":[{"name":"Manav R.

The resulting algorithm is based on the space alternating generalized expectation maximization (SAGE) technique which is particularly well suited to multicarrier signal formats leading to a receiver structure that also incorporates interchannel interference (ICI) cancelation. In order to reduce the computational complexity of the algorithm, band-limited, discrete cosine orthogonal basis functions are employed to represent the rapidly time-varying fading channel by the discrete cosine serial expansion coefficients. It is shown that, depending on the normalized Doppler frequency, only a small number of expansion coefficients is sufficient to approximate the channel perfectly and there is no need to know the correlation function of the input signal. In this way, the resulting reduced dimensional channel coefficients are estimated and the data symbols detected iteratively with tractable complexity. The proposed SAGE joint detection algorithm updates the data sequences serially and the channel parameters are updated in parallel, leading to a receiver structure that also incorporates ICI cancelation. Computer simulations show that the cosine transformation represents the time-varying channel very effectively and the proposed algorithm has excellent symbol error rate and channel estimation performance even with a very small number of channel expansion coefficients employed in the algorithm, resulting in substantial reduction of the computational complexity.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/5508649/05447736.pdf","startPage":"4225","endPage":"4238","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2010.2048317","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2010.2048317","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5508649","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5447736","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint Channel Estimation, Equalization, and Data Detection for OFDM Systems in the Presence of Very High Mobility","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Channel estimation","OFDM","Computational complexity","Frequency estimation","Time varying systems","Interchannel interference","Interference cancellation","Fading","Detection algorithms","Computer simulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adjacent channel interference","channel estimation","computational complexity","equalisers","fading channels","interference suppression","OFDM modulation","radio receivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["joint channel estimation","equalization","data detection","OFDM systems","uplink orthogonal frequency division multiplexing systems","time varying channels","space alternating generalized expectation maximization technique","multicarrier signal","receiver structure","interchannel interference cancelation","computational complexity","discrete cosine orthogonal basis function","time-varying fading channel","discrete cosine serial expansion coefficients","normalized Doppler frequency"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Intercarrier interference suppression","joint data detection and channel estimation","orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM)","rapidly varying wireless channels","space alternating generalized expectation maximization (SAGE) algorithm"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5447736/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 April 2010","displayDocTitle":"Joint Channel Estimation, Equalization, and Data Detection for OFDM Systems in the Presence of Very High Mobility","volume":"58","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/5447736/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2010","accessionNumber":"11465470","dateOfInsertion":"12 July 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint Channel Estimation, Equalization, and Data Detection for OFDM Systems in the Presence of Very High Mobility","sourcePdf":"tsp-panayirci-2048317-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.106566S","chronDate":"Aug.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"5508649","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"75","xplore-issue":"5508649","articleId":"5447736","onlineDate":"15 April 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5447766,"authors":[{"name":"Xiufeng Song","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Connecticut, Storrs, CT, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/5508649/5447766/5447766-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Xiufeng Song (S'08) received the B.S. degree from Xidian University, Xi'an, China, in 2005 and the M.S. degree from the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), Beijing, in 2008, both in electrical engineering.","He is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree with the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Connecticut, Storrs.

However, the mutual interference among the waveforms may lead to performance degradation in resolving spatially close returns. In this paper, we consider the use of space-time coding (STC) to mitigate the waveform cross-correlation effects in MIMO radar. First, it turns out that a joint waveform optimization problem can be decoupled into a set of individual waveform design problems. Second, a number of monostatic waveforms can be directly used in a MIMO radar system, which offers flexibility in waveform selection. We provide conditions for the elimination of waveform cross correlation, and discuss four kinds of space time codes. In addition, we also extend the model to partial waveform cross-correlation removal based on waveform set division. Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of STC in MIMO radar for waveform decorrelation.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/5508649/05447766.pdf","startPage":"4213","endPage":"4224","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2010.2048207","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2010.2048207","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5508649","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5447766","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reducing the Waveform Cross Correlation of MIMO Radar With Space\u2013Time Coding","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Spaceborne radar","Object detection","Parameter estimation","Interference","Degradation","Spatial resolution","Design optimization","Space time codes","Decorrelation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["interference suppression","MIMO radar","radar interference","space-time codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["waveform cross correlation reduction","MIMO radar system","space-time coding","multiple-input multiple-output radar","target detection","parameter identification","target classification","mutual interference","waveform optimization problem","waveform design problems","monostatic waveforms","waveform set division"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Clutter reduction","multiple input multiple output (MIMO) radar","pulse compression","space\u2013time coding (STC)","waveform cross-correlation elimination (CCE)","waveform design","waveform set division"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5447766/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 April 2010","displayDocTitle":"Reducing the Waveform Cross Correlation of MIMO Radar With Space\u2013Time Coding","volume":"58","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/5447766/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2010","accessionNumber":"11465473","dateOfInsertion":"12 July 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reducing the Waveform Cross Correlation of MIMO Radar With Space\u2013Time Coding","sourcePdf":"tsp-xsong-2048207-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.108352S","chronDate":"Aug.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"5508649","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"74","xplore-issue":"5508649","articleId":"5447766","onlineDate":"15 April 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5447768,"authors":[{"name":"Mohsen Eslami","affiliation":["TRLabs, Edmonton, AB, Canada","Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/5508649/5447768/5447768-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Mohsen Eslami (S'03\u2013M'09) received the B.Sc. and M.Sc. degrees from University of Tehran, Tehran, Iran, in 2000 and 2002, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree from University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB, Canada, in 2009, all in electrical engineering.","He is currently an NSERC Industrial R&D Fellow at TRLabs, Edmonton, AB, Canada.

To take advantage of diversity and multiplexing while mitigating interference, we design a low complexity efficient detector called unified successive interference cancellation (SIC) detector for SM-MC-CDM communications. Further performance improvement is achieved by adopting in conjunction with the unified SIC the iterative subcarrier reconstruction-detection algorithm originally proposed for single antenna systems. The results demonstrate significant performance improvement over other existing methods of comparable complexity.

We also find that the LCT of a white noise is still a white one. For the FRFT of a stationary process, the ambiguity function (AF) is a tilted line and the Wigner distribution function (WDF) is invariant along a certain direction. We also define the \u201cfractional stationary random process\u201d and find that a nonstationary random process can be expressed by a summation of fractional stationary random processes. In addition, after performing the filter designed in the FRFT domain for a white noise, we can use the segment length of the \u03c9 -axis on the WDF plane to estimate the power of the noise and use the area circled by cutoff lines to estimate its energy. Thus, in communication, to reduce the effect of the white noise, the \u201carea\u201d of the WDF of the transmitted signal should be as small as possible.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fractional Fourier Transform, Wigner Distribution, and Filter Design for Stationary and Nonstationary Random Processes","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2010.2048206","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/5508649/05447770.pdf","startPage":"4079","endPage":"4092","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2010.2048206","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5508649","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5447770","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5447770/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 April 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2010","displayDocTitle":"Fractional Fourier Transform, Wigner Distribution, and Filter Design for Stationary and Nonstationary Random Processes","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"58","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/5447770/","dateOfInsertion":"12 July 2010","publicationDate":"Aug. 2010","accessionNumber":"11465472","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fractional Fourier Transform, Wigner Distribution, and Filter Design for Stationary and Nonstationary Random Processes","sourcePdf":"tsp-spei-2048206-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.115425S","chronDate":"Aug.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"5508649","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"53","xplore-issue":"5508649","articleId":"5447770","onlineDate":"15 April 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5447785,"authors":[{"name":"Neil Higgins","affiliation":["ENERGEX, Brisbane, QLD, Australia"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5326/5669216/5447785/5447785-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Neil Higgins (M\u201988) received the B.E.

Previous studies have focused on single and multiunit activity (MUA), as well as low-frequency local field potentials (LFPs), but have not explored higher frequency (>200 Hz) LFPs. In addition, the potential to decode 3-D reach and grasp kinematics based on LFPs has not been demonstrated. Here, we use mutual information and decoding analyses to probe the information content about 3-D reaching and grasping of seven different LFP frequency bands in the range of 0.3-400 Hz. LFPs were recorded via 96-microelectrode arrays in primary motor cortex (M1) of two monkeys performing free reaching to grasp moving objects. Mutual information analyses revealed that higher frequency bands (e.g., 100-200 and 200-400 Hz) carried the most information about the examined kinematics. Furthermore, Kalman filter decoding revealed that broad-band high frequency LFPs, likely reflecting MUA, provided the best decoding performance as well as substantial accuracy in reconstructing reach kinematics, grasp aperture, and aperture velocity. These results indicate that LFPs, especially high frequency bands, could be useful signals for neural interfaces controlling 3-D reach and grasp kinematics.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Decoding 3-D Reach and Grasp Kinematics From High-Frequency Local Field Potentials in Primate Primary Motor Cortex","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","doi":"10.1109/TBME.2010.2047015","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/10/5484937/05447797.pdf","startPage":"1774","endPage":"1784","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TBME.2010.2047015","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5484937","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5447797","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5447797/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 April 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2010","displayDocTitle":"Decoding 3-D Reach and Grasp Kinematics From High-Frequency Local Field Potentials in Primate Primary Motor Cortex","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"57","issue":"7","htmlLink":"/document/5447797/","dateOfInsertion":"14 June 2010","publicationDate":"July 2010","accessionNumber":"11442096","pubMedId":"20403782","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Decoding 3-D Reach and Grasp Kinematics From High-Frequency Local Field Potentials in Primate Primary Motor Cortex","sourcePdf":"tbme-truccolo-2047015.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.098557S","chronDate":"July  2010","xplore-pub-id":"10","isNumber":"5484937","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"120","xplore-issue":"5484937","articleId":"5447797","onlineDate":"15 April 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5447815,"authors":[{"name":"Mangesh Borage","affiliation":["Raja Ramanna Centre for Advanced Technology, Indore, India"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/5711419/5447815/5447815-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Mangesh Borage received the B.E. degree in electrical engineering from Shivaji University, Kolhapur, India, in 1993 and the M.Tech. degree in electrical engineering with specialization in power electronics from Banaras Hindu University, Varanasi, India, in 1996.","He joined the 38th batch of training school at Bhabha Atomic Research Centre (BARC), Mumbai, India, in 1994.

The operating point and the design condition, under which these topologies exhibit immittance conversion characteristics, are derived. The suitability of these topologies in terms of absorbing parasitic components and providing inherent dc blocking to the transformer is examined.

Our approach offers and dynamically maintains multiple differentiated availability guarantees to each different application despite failures. We employ a virtual economy, where each data partition acts as an individual optimizer and chooses whether to migrate, replicate or remove itself based on net benefit maximization regarding the utility offered by the partition and its storage and maintenance cost.

In this paper, we show how to employ FPGAs to provide an efficient and high-performance solution for the frequent item problem. We discuss three design alternatives, each one of them exploiting different FPGA features, and we provide an exhaustive evaluation of their performance characteristics. The first design is a one-to-one mapping of the Space-Saving algorithm (shown to be the best approach in software [1]), built on special features of FPGAs: content-addressable memory and dual-ported BRAM. The two other implementations exploit the flexibility of digital circuits to implement parallel lookups and pipelining strategies, resulting in significant improvements in performance. On low-cost FPGA hardware, the fastest of our designs can process 80 million items per second-three times as much as the best known result. Moreover, and unlike in software approaches where performance is directly related to the skew factor of the Zipf distribution, the high throughput is independent of the skew of the distribution of the input. In the paper we discuss as well several design trade-offs that are relevant when implementing database functionality on FPGAs. In particular, we look at resource consumption and the levels of data and task parallelism of three different designs.","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE 26th International Conference on Data Engineering (ICDE 2010)","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE 26th International Conference on Data Engineering (ICDE 2010)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5443872/5447611/05447856.pdf","startPage":"669","endPage":"680","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICDE.2010.5447856","doi":"10.1109/ICDE.2010.5447856","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5447611","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"FPGA acceleration for the frequent item problem","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"FPGA acceleration for the frequent item problem","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5447856/","conferenceDate":"1-6 March 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5447856/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"15 April 2010","publicationDate":"March 2010","accessionNumber":"11258741","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-6 March 2010","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FPGA acceleration for the frequent item problem","confLoc":"Long Beach, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"0549.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.074716S","chronDate":"1-6 March 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5443872","isNumber":"5447611","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5443872","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"5447611","articleId":"5447856","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5447902,"authors":[{"name":"Ning Shang","affiliation":["Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, USA"],"firstName":"Ning","lastName":"Shang","id":"37408830100"},{"name":"Mohamed Nabeel","affiliation":["Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, USA"],"firstName":"Mohamed","lastName":"Nabeel","id":"37397139800"},{"name":"Federica Paci","affiliation":["Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, USA"],"firstName":"Federica","lastName":"Paci","id":"37318100200"},{"name":"Elisa Bertino","affiliation":["Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, USA"],"firstName":"Elisa","lastName":"Bertino","id":"37276645000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5446-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5445-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5444-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6382"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2375-026X"}],"articleNumber":"5447902","dbTime":"21 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":41,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":558},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Access control","Protection","Broadcasting","Cryptography","Privacy","Subscriptions","Content management","Identity management systems","Internet","Law"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["authorisation","data privacy","document handling","public key cryptography"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["privacy preserving","policy based content dissemination","group key management scheme","document broadcasting","access control policies","decryption keys"]}],"abstract":"We propose a novel scheme for selective distribution of content, encoded as documents, that preserves the privacy of the users to whom the documents are delivered and is based on an efficient and novel group key management scheme. Our document broadcasting approach is based on access control policies specifying which users can access which documents, or subdocuments. Based on such policies, a broadcast document is segmented into multiple subdocuments, each encrypted with a different key. In line with modern attribute-based access control, policies are specified against identity attributes of users. However our broadcasting approach is privacy-preserving in that users are granted access to a specific document, or subdocument, according to the policies without the need of providing in clear information about their identity attributes to the document publisher. Under our approach, not only does the document publisher not learn the values of the identity attributes of users, but it also does not learn which policy conditions are verified by which users, thus inferences about the values of identity attributes are prevented. Moreover, our key management scheme on which the proposed broadcasting approach is based is efficient in that it does not require to send the decryption keys to the users along with the encrypted document. Users are able to reconstruct the keys to decrypt the authorized portions of a document based on subscription information they have received from the document publisher. The scheme also efficiently handles new subscription of users and revocation of subscriptions.","doi":"10.1109/ICDE.2010.5447902","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE 26th International Conference on Data Engineering (ICDE 2010)","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE 26th International Conference on Data Engineering (ICDE 2010)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5443872/5447611/05447902.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICDE.2010.5447902","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5447611","startPage":"944","endPage":"955","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A privacy-preserving approach to policy-based content dissemination","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5447902","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A privacy-preserving approach to policy-based content dissemination","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-6 March 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5447902/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"1-6 March 2010","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"March 2010","accessionNumber":"11244827","dateOfInsertion":"15 April 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5447902/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A privacy-preserving approach to policy-based content dissemination","confLoc":"Long Beach, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"0197.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.105151S","chronDate":"1-6 March 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5443872","isNumber":"5447611","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5443872","citationCount":"41","xplore-issue":"5447611","articleId":"5447902","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5447938,"authors":[{"name":"Yew-Soon Ong","affiliation":["Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"firstName":"Yew-Soon","lastName":"Ong","id":"37298277000"},{"name":"Meng Hiot Lim","affiliation":["Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"firstName":"Meng Hiot","lastName":"Lim","id":"37277106000"},{"name":"Xianshun Chen","affiliation":["Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"firstName":"Xianshun","lastName":"Chen","id":"37403976100"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1556-603X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1556-6048"}],"articleNumber":"5447938","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":332,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1614},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computational Intelligence Society","url":"http://www.ieee-cis.org/"}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Memetic Computation\u2014Past, Present & Future [Research Frontier]","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Computational Intelligence Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel5/10207/5447934/05447938.pdf","startPage":"24","endPage":"31","publicationTitle":"IEEE Computational Intelligence Magazine","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MCI.2010.936309","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5447934","doi":"10.1109/MCI.2010.936309","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Unmanned aerial vehicles","Computational intelligence","Design optimization","Evolutionary computation","Job shop scheduling","Processor scheduling","Dynamic scheduling","Dynamic programming","Aerodynamics","Problem-solving"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["evolutionary computation","problem solving","search problems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["memetic computation","operational meme-inspired algorithms","problem solving"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5447938","abstract":"Taking a lead from the multi-faceted definitions and roles of the term \"meme\" in memetics, a plethora of potentially rich memetic computing methodologies, frameworks and operational memeinspired algorithms have been developed with considerable success in several realworld domains in the last two decades.

The goal is to solve a complex optimization problem by using a control card related to portable devices, e.g. for the control of commercial robots. In order to handle this class of optimization problems, a novel Memetic Computing approach is presented. The proposed algorithm employs a Differential Evolution framework which instead of processing an actual population of candidate solutions, makes use of a statistical representation of the population which evolves over time. In addition, the framework uses a stochastic local search algorithm which attempts to enhance the performance of the elite. In this way, the memetic logic of performing the optimization by observing the decision space from complementary perspectives can be integrated within computational devices characterized by a limited memory. The proposed algorithm, namely Memetic compact Differential Evolution (McDE), has been tested and compared with other algorithms belonging to the same category for a real-world industrial application, i.e. the control system design of a cartesian robot for variable mass movements. For this real-world application, the proposed McDE displays high performance and has proven to considerably outperform other compact algorithms representing the current state-of-the-art in this sub-field of computational intelligence.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Memetic Compact Differential Evolution for Cartesian Robot Control","publicationTitle":"IEEE Computational Intelligence Magazine","doi":"10.1109/MCI.2010.936305","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Computational Intelligence Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel5/10207/5447934/05447943.pdf","startPage":"54","endPage":"65","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MCI.2010.936305","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5447934","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5447943","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5447943/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 April 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2010","displayDocTitle":"Memetic Compact Differential Evolution for Cartesian Robot Control","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"5","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/5447943/","dateOfInsertion":"15 April 2010","publicationDate":"May 2010","accessionNumber":"11243265","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Memetic Compact Differential Evolution for Cartesian Robot Control","sourcePdf":"05mci02-neri.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.101045S","chronDate":"May  2010","xplore-pub-id":"10207","isNumber":"5447934","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10207","citationCount":"137","xplore-issue":"5447934","articleId":"5447943","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5447975,"authors":[{"name":"Zhigang Tian","affiliation":["Concordia Institute of Information Systems Engineering, Concordia University, Montreal, QUE, Canada"],"bio":{"p":["Zhigang Tian is currently an Assistant Professor in Concordia Institute for Information Systems Engineering at Concordia University, Canada.

However, most reported ANN methods only utilize condition monitoring data from failure histories, and ignore data obtained from suspension histories in which equipments are taken out of service before they fail. Suspension history condition monitoring data contains useful information revealing the degradation of equipment, and will help to achieve more accurate remaining useful life prediction if properly used, particularly when there are very limited failure histories, which is the case in many applications. In this paper, we develop an ANN approach utilizing both failure and suspension condition monitoring histories. The ANN model uses age and condition monitoring data as inputs and the life percentage as output. For each suspension history, the optimal predicted life is determined which can minimize the validation mean square error in the training process using the suspension history and the failure histories. Then the ANN is trained using the failure histories and all the suspension histories with the obtained optimal predicted life values, and the trained ANN can be used for remaining useful life prediction of other equipments. The key idea behind this approach is that the underlying relationship between the inputs and output of ANN is the same for all failure and suspension histories, and thus the optimal life for a suspension history is the one resulting in the lowest ANN validation error. The proposed approach is validated using vibration monitoring data collected from pump bearings in the field.","doi":"10.1109/RAMS.2010.5447975","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 Proceedings - Annual Reliability and Maintainability Symposium (RAMS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5443868/5447962/05447975.pdf","publicationTitle":"2010 Proceedings - Annual Reliability and Maintainability Symposium (RAMS)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RAMS.2010.5447975","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5447962","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A neural network approach for remaining useful life prediction utilizing both failure and suspension data","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","History","Artificial neural networks","Condition monitoring","Predictive models","Degradation","Prediction methods","Vibration measurement","Mean square error methods","Costs"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["condition monitoring","failure (mechanical)","machine bearings","maintenance engineering","mechanical engineering computing","neural nets","pumps","remaining life assessment","suspensions (mechanical components)","vibrations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neural network approach","remaining useful life prediction","failure data","suspension data","artificial neural network methods","condition monitoring","mean square error","ANN validation error","vibration monitoring","pump bearings"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["remaining useful life","prediction","artificial neural networks","suspension history"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5447975/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-28 Jan. 2010","displayDocTitle":"A neural network approach for remaining useful life prediction utilizing both failure and suspension data","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5447975/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"15 April 2010","conferenceDate":"25-28 Jan. 2010","accessionNumber":"11244733","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A neural network approach for remaining useful life prediction utilizing both failure and suspension data","confLoc":"San Jose, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"14A32010RM0078.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045484S","chronDate":"25-28 Jan. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5443868","isNumber":"5447962","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5443868","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"5447962","articleId":"5447975","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5448085,"authors":[{"name":"M.

The study was performed under natural field and laboratory conditions. The insulators tested included eight types of silicone rubber composite insulators, one type of hybrid silicone-ceramic insulator and one semi-conducting glazed porcelain insulator, while ordinary porcelain and glass insulators were used as reference. During the field investigation, two sets of the insulators were separately installed and energized in coastal and inland parts of Sri Lanka, being by that exposed to marine and clean tropical environments. Their performances were periodically evaluated by visual inspections and measurements of hydrophobicity class. After five years of field exposure, the insulator performances were evaluated in laboratory by measurements of leakage currents under clean fog conditions and of wet flashover voltage. A third set of the insulators was aged in laboratory for 1000 hours inside a salt fog chamber where the insulators were continuously energized and daily sprayed with salt solution for eight hours and left to rest for remaining 16 hours. This treatment represented conditions similar as those in the field i.e. insulators exposed to salt sprays during monsoons. The insulator performances were investigated by measurements of leakage currents and classifying their patterns into different categories, i.e. capacitive, resistive, non-linear, discharge and strong discharge types, by means of fast Fourier transform and short time Fourier transform analyses. It was found that the long-term field exposure yielded weaker insulator deterioration than the salt fog chamber ageing, which indicated for a possibility to increase the electric stress on silicone rubber insulators to levels higher than the ones used today on glass and porcelain counterparts.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Ageing of silicone rubber insulators in coastal and inland tropical environment","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Dielectrics and Electrical Insulation","doi":"10.1109/TDEI.2010.5448085","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Dielectrics and Electrical Insulation","pdfPath":"/iel5/94/5448081/05448085.pdf","startPage":"326","endPage":"333","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TDEI.2010.5448085","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5448081","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5448085","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5448085/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 April 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2010","displayDocTitle":"Ageing of silicone rubber insulators in coastal and inland tropical environment","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"17","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/5448085/","dateOfInsertion":"19 April 2010","publicationDate":"April 2010","accessionNumber":"11256510","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Ageing of silicone rubber insulators in coastal and inland tropical environment","sourcePdf":"p0326-fernando.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.072777S","chronDate":"April  2010","xplore-pub-id":"94","isNumber":"5448081","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"94","citationCount":"76","xplore-issue":"5448081","articleId":"5448085","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5448099,"authors":[{"name":"C.

The monitoring methodology uses different ANNs in order to predict the appearance of the white arc based on the identification, classification and analysis of the occurrence frequency of electric discharges. The results show that the ANN monitoring model developed is able to predict the onset of permanent regime under various experimental conditions. Hence, it was found that the delay between the permanent regime onset prediction delivered by the ANN model and its realization is 9 minutes on average.

Presently, the most efficient way is to clean (or replace) the heavily polluted insulators. The leakage current is the critical online quantity that can be detected. A number of laboratory experiments on 35 kV voltage class ceramic and glass insulators show that the leakage current fully reflects the entire process of contamination flashover development. The test results reveal that the process can be classified into three stages, i.e., security stage, forecast stage and danger stage. The results, that were duplicated several times, are based on three characteristics of the leakage current, i.e., the root-mean-square value, waveforms, and power spectrum estimation. In addition, the boundaries of the three stages in both time domain and power spectrum domain are also determined. All these can be used for the stage pre-warning of contamination flashovers. The security stage is most important since it precedes the contamination flashover sufficiently. The three characteristics of the leakage current in the security stage are proposed as the inputs of a neural network model together with the operating voltage, and the relative humidity in order to determine the equivalent salt deposit density (ESDD) of the insulators. The comparison of the simulated and actual (measured) results demonstrates that the ESDD prediction model has a very low relative error if the training data and the testing data both come from the security stage. The application of this research results in (1) optimal ESDD prediction inputs and (2) sufficient pre-warning time before the ultimate contamination flashover.","doi":"10.1109/TDEI.2010.5448105","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Dielectrics and Electrical Insulation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Dielectrics and Electrical Insulation","pdfPath":"/iel5/94/5448081/05448105.pdf","startPage":"490","endPage":"501","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TDEI.2010.5448105","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5448081","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Use of leakage currents of insulators to determine the stage characteristics of the flashover process and contamination level prediction","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5448105","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 April 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5448105/","displayDocTitle":"Use of leakage currents of insulators to determine the stage characteristics of the flashover process and contamination level prediction","volume":"17","issue":"2","publicationDate":"April 2010","accessionNumber":"11256485","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5448105/","dateOfInsertion":"19 April 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Use of leakage currents of insulators to determine the stage characteristics of the flashover process and contamination level prediction","sourcePdf":"p0490-li.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.077531S","chronDate":"April  2010","xplore-pub-id":"94","isNumber":"5448081","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"94","citationCount":"49","xplore-issue":"5448081","articleId":"5448105","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":5448108,"authors":[{"name":"G.

A dc test has been developed from the current ac standard and three formulations of silicone rubber tested. These materials were tested under three voltage levels (2.3, 2.7 and 3.2 kV) for both polarities. Positive dc tests have the highest average and peak leakage current and exhibit a higher degree of surface damage. The observed surface degradation pattern is heavily dependant on polarity. Consistently higher levels of erosion have been observed in the higher voltage positive cases. Erosion of the surface always starts at the bottom electrode, and spreads toward the top electrode. Puncturing of the 6 mm thick samples or deep erosion over more than half the distance between electrodes has only been observed under 2.7 and 3.2 kV positive polarity tests. Results have been analysed using a variety of leakage current analysis techniques going beyond the criteria specified in the original ac standard. The low-frequency behaviour of the leakage current was monitored using a 15 sample per second current recorder. The leakage current magnitude is investigated in a case study and is shown to follow a normal distribution. Reversing the polarity of tests shows the leakage current seen in a test is largely independent of the surface degradation pattern present, but the surface degradation pattern over the first three hours may dictate the morphology of ensuing deep erosion.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Dielectrics and Electrical Insulation","pdfPath":"/iel5/94/5448081/05448108.pdf","startPage":"521","endPage":"532","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Dielectrics and Electrical Insulation","doi":"10.1109/TDEI.2010.5448108","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TDEI.2010.5448108","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5448081","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5448108","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance of silicone rubber in DC inclined plane tracking tests","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Rubber","Leakage current","Surface morphology","Degradation","Electrodes","Voltage","Standards development","Materials testing","Monitoring","Gaussian distribution"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["HVDC power transmission","insulating materials","rubber","silicon"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["silicone rubber","DC inclined plane tracking tests","erosion test","electrode","leakage current","polarity","IEC-60587"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Silicone rubber, IEC 60587, dc, electrical discharge, tracking, erosion."]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5448108/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 April 2010","displayDocTitle":"Performance of silicone rubber in DC inclined plane tracking tests","volume":"17","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/5448108/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2010","accessionNumber":"11256505","dateOfInsertion":"19 April 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance of silicone rubber in DC inclined plane tracking tests","sourcePdf":"p0521-bruce.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.069807S","chronDate":"April  2010","xplore-pub-id":"94","isNumber":"5448081","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"94","citationCount":"48","xplore-issue":"5448081","articleId":"5448108","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-20"},{"_id":5448118,"authors":[{"name":"Stephanie Raetzke","affiliation":["Laboratory for High Voltage Technology and Power Transmission, Technische Universitat Munchen, Munich, Germany"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/94/5448081/5448118/5448118-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Stephanie Raetzke (M'04).

The silicones with filler type F1 show a high improvement of the resistance to high-voltage arcing and the resistance to tracking and erosion at very low filler contents. Furthermore, a maximum resistance to high-voltage arcing is observed for these nanocomposites at a filler content of 5% wt. In contrast to that the silicones with filler type F2 show no significant improvement for both resistances. The effects are explained by the ratio of interphase to matrix material, which is estimated by the Interphase Volume Model. The thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) shows that the resistance to thermal degradation is significantly higher for the silicones with filler type F1 already at a filler content of 0.5 wt.% compared to the material without any fillers. The resistance to thermal degradation for the materials with filler type F2 is significantly lower.

The hardware architecture is built with a 16-bit AD converter and 32-bit high speed DSP processor as the core. This analysis method and its realization based on DSP can obviously correct the synchronization error caused by the small deviation of the power network frequency, which ensures a higher accuracy of the harmonic amplitudes and phase angles.

Service restoration of distribution systems is to restore power to the blacked out but unfaulted area. Basically, it is a combinatorial optimization problem that often has a great number of candidate solutions to be evaluated by the system operators. To tackle the problem of service restoration, an EDE method which combines variable scaling DE and ant colony algorithm is employed to solve the multi-objective optimization problem. The proposed method was tested on a typical distribution system of the Taiwan Power Company (TPC) and compared with the heuristic-based fuzzy algorithm and classical DE method. Results show that the proposed method was superior to that of the existing methods in terms of convergence time and obtained restoration plans.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5448125","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APPEEC.2010.5448398","publicationTitle":"2010 Asia-Pacific Power and Energy Engineering Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 Asia-Pacific Power and Energy Engineering Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5447158/5448125/05448398.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","doi":"10.1109/APPEEC.2010.5448398","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Enhanced Differential Evolution Approach to Service Restoration of Distribution Systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-31 March 2010","displayDocTitle":"An Enhanced Differential Evolution Approach to Service Restoration of Distribution Systems","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"28-31 March 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5448398/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2010","accessionNumber":"11258156","dateOfInsertion":"15 April 2010","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5448398/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Enhanced Differential Evolution Approach to Service Restoration of Distribution Systems","confLoc":"Chengdu, China","sourcePdf":"05-203.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053492S","chronDate":"28-31 March 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5447158","isNumber":"5448125","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5447158","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5448125","articleId":"5448398","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5448424,"authors":[{"name":"Hua Ye","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Shandong University, Jinan, China"],"firstName":"Hua","lastName":"Ye","id":"37398677700"},{"name":"Yutian Liu","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Shandong University, Jinan, China"],"firstName":"Yutian","lastName":"Liu","id":"37279423700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4812-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4813-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2157-4839"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2157-4847"}],"articleNumber":"5448424","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":276},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["State-space methods","Damping","Power system modeling","Predictive models","Power system control","Power system measurements","Power systems","Control system synthesis","Wide area measurements","Frequency"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["closed loop systems","damping","power system control","power system measurement","predictive control","recursive estimation","reduced order systems","state-space methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["online recursive closed-loop state space model","damping control","identification algorithm","POEIV-MOESP","wide-area measurements","dominant low frequency oscillation modes","EIV-PAST algorithm","RLS method","predictive control","New England 10-machine 39-bus system"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5448424","abstract":"An online recursive closed-loop state space model identification algorithm, POEIV-MOESP, is proposed for power system damping control.

In this paper, a novel approach for generation rescheduling constrained to small signal stability based on neural network sensitivity analysis is presented. The proposed method considers system minimum eigenvalue as stability index for generation rescheduling. A Security Analyzer Neural Network (SANN) is trained to estimate minimum eigenvalue associated with each generation pattern. The main motivation for neural network application is its ability for sensitivity analysis of eigenvalue. For any given operating point of power system, SANN evaluates minimum eigenvalue using corresponding generation pattern as input. Then sensitivity of the minimum eigenvalue with respect to generation pattern is used as a measure for changing generator outputs in order to increase system damping. Effectiveness and applicability of proposed approach is demonstrated on WSCC 9-bus test system.","doi":"10.1109/APPEEC.2010.5448451","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 Asia-Pacific Power and Energy Engineering Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5447158/5448125/05448451.pdf","publicationTitle":"2010 Asia-Pacific Power and Energy Engineering Conference","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APPEEC.2010.5448451","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5448125","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Small Signal Stability Constrained Rescheduling Using Sensitivities Analysis by Neural Network as a Preventive Tool","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Stability analysis","Sensitivity analysis","Neural networks","Power system stability","Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","Power system security","Power system interconnection","Power system analysis computing","Frequency","Signal generators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neural nets","oscillations","power engineering computing","power generation scheduling","power system interconnection","power system security","power system stability","sensitivity analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["signal stability","rescheduling","frequency oscillations","interconnected power systems","neural network sensitivity analysis","security analysis","WSCC 9-bus test system","generation pattern"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5448451/","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-31 March 2010","displayDocTitle":"Small Signal Stability Constrained Rescheduling Using Sensitivities Analysis by Neural Network as a Preventive Tool","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5448451/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2010","dateOfInsertion":"15 April 2010","conferenceDate":"28-31 March 2010","accessionNumber":"11257034","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Small Signal Stability Constrained Rescheduling Using Sensitivities Analysis by Neural Network as a Preventive Tool","confLoc":"Chengdu, China","sourcePdf":"06-015.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053073S","chronDate":"28-31 March 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5447158","isNumber":"5448125","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5447158","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5448125","articleId":"5448451","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5448485,"authors":[{"name":"Lixia Wang","affiliation":["College of Electrical Engineering, Southwest Jiaotong University, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Lixia","lastName":"Wang","id":"37085920180"},{"name":"Zhengyou He","affiliation":["College of Electrical Engineering, Southwest Jiaotong University, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Zhengyou","lastName":"He","id":"37291353700"},{"name":"Jing Zhao","affiliation":["College of Electrical Engineering, Southwest Jiaotong University, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Jing","lastName":"Zhao","id":"37633814500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4812-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4813-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2157-4839"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2157-4847"}],"articleNumber":"5448485","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":88},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power quality","Neural networks","Fourier transforms","Feature extraction","Signal processing","Monitoring","Frequency","Signal analysis","Artificial neural networks","Testing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Fourier transforms","neural nets","power engineering computing","power supply quality"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power quality disturbance classification","rough membership neural networks","equipment damage avoidance","linear time-frequency distribution","windowed Fourier transform","S-transform"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5448485","abstract":"Building a power quality monitoring and analysis system is important to improve power quality and avoid equipment damage.

The new approach identifies most types of PQ disturbance, such as voltage sags, swells, interruptions, transients, harmonics and flickers. The new model mainly includes three steps. Firstly, S-transform is used to analyze power system disturbance signals, and 18 distinguishing features are extracted from the result of S-transform. Secondly, principal-component analysis (PCA) is used to reduce the dimensionality of features data set, mean while extract principal-components to describe nonstationary signals of power system. Finally, use the principal-components as the input vectors of BP neural network modified by adaptive learning factor, and classify the disturbances signals. The simulation results show the validity and efficiency of the proposed model.","doi":"10.1109/APPEEC.2010.5448666","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 Asia-Pacific Power and Energy Engineering Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5447158/5448125/05448666.pdf","publicationTitle":"2010 Asia-Pacific Power and Energy Engineering Conference","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APPEEC.2010.5448666","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5448125","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Power Quality Disturbances Recognition Based on PCA and BP Neural Network","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power quality","Principal component analysis","Neural networks","Power system modeling","Signal analysis","Power system transients","Power system harmonics","Power system analysis computing","Data mining","Power system simulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["backpropagation","fault diagnosis","neural nets","power engineering computing","power supply quality","principal component analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power quality disturbances recognition","PCA","BP neural network","power quality disturbances","principal-component analysis","voltage sags","voltage swells","voltage interruptions","S-transform","adaptive learning factor","disturbances signal classification"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5448666/","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-31 March 2010","displayDocTitle":"Power Quality Disturbances Recognition Based on PCA and BP Neural Network","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5448666/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2010","dateOfInsertion":"15 April 2010","conferenceDate":"28-31 March 2010","accessionNumber":"11257428","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Power Quality Disturbances Recognition Based on PCA and BP Neural Network","confLoc":"Chengdu, China","sourcePdf":"05-040.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061274S","chronDate":"28-31 March 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5447158","isNumber":"5448125","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5447158","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5448125","articleId":"5448666","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5448728,"authors":[{"name":"Haiping Liang","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, North China Electric Power University, Baoding, China"],"firstName":"Haiping","lastName":"Liang","id":"37397742500"},{"name":"Xueping Gu","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, North China Electric Power University, Baoding, China"],"firstName":"Xueping","lastName":"Gu","id":"37276605100"},{"name":"Dongwen Zhao","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, North China Electric Power University, Baoding, China"],"firstName":"Dongwen","lastName":"Zhao","id":"37402819400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4812-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4813-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2157-4839"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2157-4847"}],"articleNumber":"5448728","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":11,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":425},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power system restoration","Genetic algorithms","Power supplies","Partitioning algorithms","Power system planning","Turbines","Boilers","Time factors","Load flow","Power distribution"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithms","power distribution faults","power system restoration"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["system partitioning schemes","optimization","power system black-start restoration","genetic algorithms","power flow constraints","power distribution","IEEE 118-bus power system"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5448728","abstract":"In this paper, the strategy for black-start system partitioning is investigated by considering the optimal start-up sequence of the units in each subsystem. Meanwhile, the time and capability constraints during unit restarting are also considered. Considering the different requirements of the various kinds of units in the different stages of the restoration, this paper proposes a three-stage partitioning algorithm based on genetic algorithms. By the proposed method, a feasible scheme of system partitioning can be found with more units to be restarted-up within the time requirements and the time consumption for the whole system restoration can be reduced to a minimum value. To each subsystem, the power flow constraints are checked to ensure a feasible power distribution. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated by the numerical results on the IEEE 118-bus power system.","doi":"10.1109/APPEEC.2010.5448728","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","publicationTitle":"2010 Asia-Pacific Power and Energy Engineering Conference","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APPEEC.2010.5448728","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5448125","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 Asia-Pacific Power and Energy Engineering Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5447158/5448125/05448728.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimization of System Partitioning Schemes for Power System Black-Start Restoration Based on Genetic Algorithms","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5448728/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Optimization of System Partitioning Schemes for Power System Black-Start Restoration Based on Genetic Algorithms","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5448728/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11257669","publicationDate":"March 2010","dateOfInsertion":"15 April 2010","conferenceDate":"28-31 March 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-31 March 2010","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimization of System Partitioning Schemes for Power System Black-Start Restoration Based on Genetic Algorithms","confLoc":"Chengdu, China","sourcePdf":"05-095.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056954S","chronDate":"28-31 March 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5447158","isNumber":"5448125","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5447158","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"5448125","articleId":"5448728","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5448778,"authors":[{"name":"Kazem Haghdar","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Iran University of Science and Technology, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Kazem","lastName":"Haghdar","id":"37395540200"},{"name":"Heidar Ali Shayanfar","affiliation":["Centre of Excellence of Power System Automation and Operation, Iran University of Science and Technology, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Heidar Ali","lastName":"Shayanfar","id":"37408386900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4812-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4813-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2157-4839"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2157-4847"}],"articleNumber":"5448778","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":11,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1048},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5448778","abstract":"This article has been retracted by the publisher.","doi":"10.1109/APPEEC.2010.5448778","pdfPath":"/iel5/5447158/5448125/05448778.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 Asia-Pacific Power and Energy Engineering Conference","publicationTitle":"2010 Asia-Pacific Power and Energy Engineering Conference","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APPEEC.2010.5448778","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5448125","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Notice of Retraction: Optimal Placement and Sizing of DG and Capacitor for the Loss Reduction via Methods of Generalized Pattern Search and Genetic Algorithm","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5448778/","xploreNote":"Notice of Retraction: After careful and considered review of the content of this paper by a duly constituted expert committee, this paper has been found to be in violation of IEEE's Publication Principles.

In this paper, the classified effect of quantum neural network has been used in the fault diagnosis of transformer. Firstly, the parameter space is mapped to the fault state space rationally by updating the connection weights, and macroscopic information is collected by a classifier. Secondly, the renewed quantum intervals are smoothed, and the uncertain data can be related to different types with proper ratios, through which the accuracy of pattern recognition is improved. Through combing with rough set effectively, quantum neural network can improve the speed by reducing the redundant samples at the same time. Finally, the quantum neural network is compared with BP neural network in dealing with the actual examples, and the validity and feasibility has been proved.","doi":"10.1109/APPEEC.2010.5448911","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","publicationTitle":"2010 Asia-Pacific Power and Energy Engineering Conference","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APPEEC.2010.5448911","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5448125","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 Asia-Pacific Power and Energy Engineering Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5447158/5448125/05448911.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Application of Quantum Neural Network Based on Rough Set in Transformer Fault Diagnosis","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5448911/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Application of Quantum Neural Network Based on Rough Set in Transformer Fault Diagnosis","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5448911/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11258179","publicationDate":"March 2010","dateOfInsertion":"15 April 2010","conferenceDate":"28-31 March 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-31 March 2010","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Application of Quantum Neural Network Based on Rough Set in Transformer Fault Diagnosis","confLoc":"Chengdu, China","sourcePdf":"05-044.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049975S","chronDate":"28-31 March 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5447158","isNumber":"5448125","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5447158","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5448125","articleId":"5448911","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5448918,"authors":[{"name":"Qianjin Liu","affiliation":["College of Electric Power, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Qianjin","lastName":"Liu","id":"37290888700"},{"name":"Chuanjian Li","affiliation":["College of Electric Power, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Chuanjian","lastName":"Li","id":"37403922300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4812-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4813-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2157-4839"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2157-4847"}],"articleNumber":"5448918","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":304},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Particle swarm optimization","Multiagent systems","Convergence","Switches","Educational institutions","Birds","Testing","Reactive power","Computational modeling","Network topology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distribution networks","multi-agent systems","particle swarm optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distribution network reconfiguration","discrete particle swarm optimization","multiagent system","binary particle swarm optimization","self-learning mechanism","lattice-like environment","iteration particles","fittest mechanism","PG&E 69 nodes distribution system"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5448918","abstract":"A novel method is proposed to solve the distribution network reconfiguration. The proposed method combines the binary particle swarm optimization (BPSO) with discrete particle swarm optimization (DPSO) and multi-agent system (MAS). It also incorporates self-learning mechanism and the survival of the fittest which is a part of natural selection for reconfigure distribution network. In the algorithm, each particle is thought to be an agent and all agents live in a lattice-like environment. The competition and cooperation operator is preformed on every agent. If the agent is a loser, a new agent will occupy its lattice-point which is determined by BPSO and DPSO. If the agent is a winner, it can perform the self-learning mechanism, so as to obtain the better fitness value. Finally the next iteration particles are determined by the fitness value of previous particles, according to the survival of the fittest mechanism. The proposed method applied for reconfiguration distribution network is evaluated on a typical example of PG&E 69 nodes distribution system and compares with other methods. The result shows that the method has superior features, including good computation efficiency, good convergence characteristics, and high-quality solutions etc.","doi":"10.1109/APPEEC.2010.5448918","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","publicationTitle":"2010 Asia-Pacific Power and Energy Engineering Conference","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APPEEC.2010.5448918","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5448125","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 Asia-Pacific Power and Energy Engineering Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5447158/5448125/05448918.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Novel Hybrid Multiagent-based Particle Swarm Optimization for Distribution Network Reconfiguration","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5448918/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A Novel Hybrid Multiagent-based Particle Swarm Optimization for Distribution Network Reconfiguration","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5448918/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11258186","publicationDate":"March 2010","dateOfInsertion":"15 April 2010","conferenceDate":"28-31 March 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-31 March 2010","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Novel Hybrid Multiagent-based Particle Swarm Optimization for Distribution Network Reconfiguration","confLoc":"Chengdu, China","sourcePdf":"06-137.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.081356S","chronDate":"28-31 March 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5447158","isNumber":"5448125","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5447158","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5448125","articleId":"5448918","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5448941,"authors":[{"name":"Xinyu Dou","affiliation":["College of Information Engineering, Inner Mongolia University of Technology, Hohhot, China"],"firstName":"Xinyu","lastName":"Dou","id":"37408810700"},{"name":"Chunming Li","affiliation":["College of Information Engineering, Inner Mongolia University of Technology, Hohhot, China"],"firstName":"Chunming","lastName":"Li","id":"37403928200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4812-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4813-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2157-4839"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2157-4847"}],"articleNumber":"5448941","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":161},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Grounding","Wavelet transforms","Power system transients","Genetic mutations","Coils","Transient analysis","Wavelet domain","Frequency domain analysis","Voltage","Educational institutions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["coils","earthing","power distribution faults","wavelet transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["small current grounding system","wavelet transform magnitude","single phase ground fault line selection","distribution networks","modulus maxima","wavelet transform polarity","zero-sequence currents","relative system models","PSB","Matlab6.5","neutral nongrounding system","neutral extinction coil grounding system"]}],"abstract":"A method of single phase ground fault line selection in distribution networks with the application of wavelet transform technique is presented in this paper.

Mixed Integer Nonlinear Programming (MINLP) is used for this purpose as a useful technique for combinatorial optimization over integers and variables. This technique can provide a fast approach as well as high computational efficiency even in solving complex optimization problems. Previous works used DC power flow that has well known limitations such as reactive power balance and reactive power loss ignorance. This paper uses novel Line Flow Based (LFB) equation that employs line power flow (instead of line current) and square of the bus voltages as variables. Since control variables such as line active and reactive power flow figure directly in formulation, handling the control action of the Flexible Alternating Current Transmission Systems (FACTS) devices is directly and easily implemented. The objectives of this paper are increasing system loadability and decreasing power losses and VAr generation cost by finding the optimal location, number and initial setting of the SVCs.","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 Asia-Pacific Power and Energy Engineering Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5447158/5448125/05449067.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","publicationTitle":"2010 Asia-Pacific Power and Energy Engineering Conference","doi":"10.1109/APPEEC.2010.5449067","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APPEEC.2010.5449067","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5448125","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5449067","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal Placement of SVC Based on Line Flow Base Equation Using Mixed Integer Nonlinear Programming","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Static VAr compensators","Nonlinear equations","Reactive power","Load flow","Control systems","Power systems","Computational efficiency","Voltage","Reactive power control","Flexible AC transmission systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["flexible AC transmission systems","nonlinear programming","static VAr compensators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optimal placement","SVC","line flow base equation","mixed integer nonlinear programming","combinatorial optimization","flexible alternating current transmission systems","FACTS","power losses","VAr generation cost"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5449067/","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-31 March 2010","displayDocTitle":"Optimal Placement of SVC Based on Line Flow Base Equation Using Mixed Integer Nonlinear Programming","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5449067/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2010","accessionNumber":"11256903","dateOfInsertion":"15 April 2010","conferenceDate":"28-31 March 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal Placement of SVC Based on Line Flow Base Equation Using Mixed Integer Nonlinear Programming","confLoc":"Chengdu, China","sourcePdf":"04-109.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06098S","chronDate":"28-31 March 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5447158","isNumber":"5448125","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5447158","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5448125","articleId":"5449067","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5449083,"authors":[{"name":"I.

A major difference exists between a conventional cooperative beamforming problem and cooperative beamforming in a CR (Cognitive Radio)network due to the interference constraints imposed by primary network. These constraints can greatly increase the complexity of the related optimization problem and make it much more challenging. Here, we have assumed a typical CR network where a set of cognitive relay nodes collaboratively assist the secondary transmitter to relay its message signal to the destination in the presence of a primary transmitter-receiver pair. Each relay employs the Amplify-and-Forward (AF) protocol to retransmit the signal. In fact, the relays comprise a distributed beamformer to beamform the signal towards its destination while maintaining the QoS in the primary user. The objective is designing the beamformer in order to maximize the target SINR in the cognitive network subject to the network power limitations and interference constraints on the primary network. First, the cooperative beamforming problem has been solved and the improved performance in terms of target SINR in the secondary network has been investigated by simulations. Secondly, a parameter has been derived to demonstrate the distance between the optimal beamweights in this problem and the beamweights in a conventional beamforming problem. Simulations show that the target SINR can be dramatically increased by using cooperative beamforming. Moreover, they show that there is a great distinction between the optimal solutions in conventional cooperative beamforming and cooperative beamforming in cognitive radios.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WD.2009.5449675","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5449647","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 2nd IFIP Wireless Days (WD)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5446257/5449647/05449675.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cooperative beamforming in Cognitive Radio networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5449675/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-17 Dec. 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5449675/","displayDocTitle":"Cooperative beamforming in Cognitive Radio networks","conferenceDate":"15-17 Dec. 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","accessionNumber":"11244869","dateOfInsertion":"15 April 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cooperative beamforming in Cognitive Radio networks","confLoc":"Paris, France","sourcePdf":"1569242347.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.086089S","chronDate":"15-17 Dec. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5446257","isNumber":"5449647","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5446257","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"5449647","articleId":"5449675","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5449676,"authors":[{"name":"Chakchai So-In","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science & Engineering, Washington University of Saint Louis, Saint Louis, MO, USA"],"firstName":"Chakchai","lastName":"So-In","id":"38274911800"},{"name":"Raj Jain","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science & Engineering, Washington University of Saint Louis, Saint Louis, MO, USA"],"firstName":"Raj","lastName":"Jain","id":"37279811700"},{"name":"Abdel-Karim Al Tamimi","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science & Engineering, Washington University of Saint Louis, Saint Louis, MO, USA"],"firstName":"Abdel-Karim","lastName":"Al Tamimi","id":"38270765100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5661-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5660-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5662-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2156-9711"}],"articleNumber":"5449676","dbTime":"19 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":34,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":202},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["WiMAX","Downlink","Resource management","Mobile computing","Quality of service","Frequency conversion","Computer science","USA Councils","Strips","Bandwidth"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["communication complexity","IEEE standards","mobile radio","quality of service","resource allocation","WiMax"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["burst mapping algorithm","QoS requirements","IEEE 802.16e","mobile WiMAX networks","resource allocation","NP-complete","rectangular mapping","enumeration process","complexity"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["component","Burst Mapping","Two-dimensional downlink mapping","Mobile WiMAX","IEEE 802.16e","Scheduling"]}],"abstract":"Mobile WiMAX systems based on the IEEE 802.16e standard require all downlink allocations to be mapped to a rectangular region in the two dimensional subcarrier-time map. Many published resource allocation schemes ignore this requirement. It is possible that the allocations when mapped to rectangular regions may exceed the capacity of the downlink frame, and the QoS of some flows may be violated. The rectangle mapping problem is a variation of the bin or strip packing problem, which is known to be NP-complete. In a previous paper, an algorithm called OCSA (One Column Striping with non-increasing Area first mapping) for rectangular mapping was introduced. In this paper, we propose an enhanced version of the algorithm. Similar to OCSA, the enhanced algorithm is also simple and fast to implement; however, eOCSA considers the allocation of an additional resource to ensure the QoS. eOCSA also avoids an enumeration process and so lowers the complexity to O(n\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n).","doi":"10.1109/WD.2009.5449676","publicationTitle":"2009 2nd IFIP Wireless Days (WD)","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 2nd IFIP Wireless Days (WD)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5446257/5449647/05449676.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WD.2009.5449676","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5449647","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"eOCSA: An algorithm for burst mapping with strict QoS requirements in IEEE 802.16e Mobile WiMAX networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5449676","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"eOCSA: An algorithm for burst mapping with strict QoS requirements in IEEE 802.16e Mobile WiMAX networks","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-17 Dec. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5449676/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"15-17 Dec. 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","accessionNumber":"11244870","dateOfInsertion":"15 April 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5449676/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"eOCSA: An algorithm for burst mapping with strict QoS requirements in IEEE 802.16e Mobile WiMAX networks","confLoc":"Paris, France","sourcePdf":"1569242941.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054027S","chronDate":"15-17 Dec. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5446257","isNumber":"5449647","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5446257","citationCount":"34","xplore-issue":"5449647","articleId":"5449676","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":5449685,"authors":[{"name":"Elias Yaacoub","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, American University of Beirut, Beirut, Lebanon"],"firstName":"Elias","lastName":"Yaacoub","id":"37391781400"},{"name":"Charles Yaacoub","affiliation":["Faculty of Sciences and Computer Engineering, Holy Spirit University of Kaslik, Jounieh, Lebanon"],"firstName":"Charles","lastName":"Yaacoub","id":"37392081100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5661-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5660-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5662-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2156-9711"}],"articleNumber":"5449685","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":128},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Array signal processing","Fading","Fluctuations","Transmitting antennas","Diversity methods","Resource management","Scheduling algorithm","Signal to noise ratio","Rayleigh channels","Antenna arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","frequency division multiple access","OFDM modulation","scheduling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["uplink scheduling","OFDMA systems","opportunistic beamforming","OFDMA uplink","complexity scheduling algorithm","greedy fair utilities","proportional fair utilities","pseudorandom fashion","artificial fading variations","antenna gain"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["OFDMA","uplink","resource allocation","scheduling","opportunistic beamforming","antenna arrays"]}],"abstract":"Opportunistic beamforming is investigated in OFDMA uplink.

Furthermore, we compare TDMA with orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) and we show that the latter scheme provides large capacity gains w.r.t. TDMA both with and without CP adaptation. To simplify complexity and lower the amount of feedback, we propose to adapt over a finite set of pre-determined CP values. These values are computed using a method that is based on the analysis of the distribution of the capacity-optimal CP. For the numerical results, we have used the widely adopted channel model of the IEEE 802.11 standard, and we have found that a single value of CP for each channel class of this model is sufficient to achieve nearly optimal capacity for a wide range of distances.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improving WLAN capacity via OFDMA and cyclic prefix adaptation","publicationTitle":"2009 2nd IFIP Wireless Days (WD)","doi":"10.1109/WD.2009.5449689","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 2nd IFIP Wireless Days (WD)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5446257/5449647/05449689.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WD.2009.5449689","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5449647","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5449689","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5449689/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-17 Dec. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Improving WLAN capacity via OFDMA and cyclic prefix adaptation","conferenceDate":"15-17 Dec. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5449689/","dateOfInsertion":"15 April 2010","publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","accessionNumber":"11244883","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improving WLAN capacity via OFDMA and cyclic prefix adaptation","confLoc":"Paris, France","sourcePdf":"1569241883.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.184526S","chronDate":"15-17 Dec. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5446257","isNumber":"5449647","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5446257","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"5449647","articleId":"5449689","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5449711,"authors":[{"name":"Mohamed Kadhem Karray","affiliation":["Research and Development Division, France Telecom, Issy-Les-Moulineaux, France"],"firstName":"Mohamed Kadhem","lastName":"Karray","id":"37391440100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5661-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5660-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5662-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2156-9711"}],"articleNumber":"5449711","dbTime":"26 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":88},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Land mobile radio cellular systems","Base stations","Interference","Geometry","Shadow mapping","Resource management","Telecommunications","Research and development","Electronic mail","Propagation losses"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["approximation theory","cellular radio","radiofrequency interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wireless cellular networks","f-factor","interference to signal power ratio","hexagonal network model","base stations","regular hexagonal grid","propagation loss","transmitter","receiver"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Radio communication","Broadband communication","Communication system performance","Interference","Geometry"]}],"abstract":"The f-factor, which is roughly the interference to signal power ratio, plays a crucial role in the performance evaluation of wireless cellular networks. The objective of the present paper is to study the properties of the f-factor and establish approximations for it which we compare to previously proposed approximations. We consider the hexagonal network model, where the base stations are placed on a regular hexagonal grid which may be infinite. The propagation loss is assumed to be a power of the distance between the transmitter and the receiver. In this context, we build a reference method to calculate the f-factor to which previously proposed approximations as well as a new one are compared. It is shown that the previous approximations are not always close to the reference. One should choose the approximation carefully since the performance of cellular networks depend strongly on the f-factor. The results in our paper help to make the appropriate choice. This is particularly important for operational needs as for example dimensioning a real network.","doi":"10.1109/WD.2009.5449711","publicationTitle":"2009 2nd IFIP Wireless Days (WD)","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 2nd IFIP Wireless Days (WD)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5446257/5449647/05449711.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WD.2009.5449711","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5449647","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Study of a key factor for performance evaluation of wireless cellular networks: The f-factor","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5449711","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-17 Dec. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5449711/","displayDocTitle":"Study of a key factor for performance evaluation of wireless cellular networks: The f-factor","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","accessionNumber":"11244905","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5449711/","conferenceDate":"15-17 Dec. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"15 April 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Study of a key factor for performance evaluation of wireless cellular networks: The f-factor","confLoc":"Paris, France","sourcePdf":"1569231067.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.113844S","chronDate":"15-17 Dec. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5446257","isNumber":"5449647","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5446257","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"5449647","articleId":"5449711","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":5449717,"authors":[{"name":"Chengwen Xing","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Chengwen","lastName":"Xing","id":"37392522900"},{"name":"Shaodan Ma","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Shaodan","lastName":"Ma","id":"37280187300"},{"name":"Yik-Chung Wu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Yik-Chung","lastName":"Wu","id":"37281222900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5122-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5123-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2166-9570"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2166-9589"}],"articleNumber":"5449717","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":131},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Transceivers","MIMO","Relays","Uncertainty","Covariance matrix","Channel estimation","Robustness","Receiving antennas","Transmitting antennas","Iterative algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","iterative methods","mean square error methods","MIMO systems","transceivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["iterative LMMSE transceiver design","dual-hop AF MIMO relay systems","channel uncertainties","robust linear transceiver design","amplify-and-forward MIMO relay system","Gaussian random channel uncertainties","mean-square-error","iterative algorithm","channel estimation errors"]}],"abstract":"This paper considers the problem of robust linear transceiver design for a dual-hop amplify-and-forward (AF) MIMO relay system, with Gaussian random channel uncertainties in both hops.

To achieve higher throughput, multiple rows of the parity check matrix may be decoded in parallel, as in the Parallel-Turbo Decoding Message Passing (P-TDMP) algorithm. However, contention for globally shared memory permits only a subset of rows to be decoded in parallel thus limiting overall throughput. This paper uses a near optimal scheduling algorithm, based on graph colouring, to overcome memory contention, allowing processing of multiple rows without code modification, resulting in significant throughput gains over the standard P-TDMP algorithm. For the LDPC codes studied, throughput gains compared to the P-TDMP algorithm, of between ten and fifteen are shown to be possible.","doi":"10.1109/PIMRC.2009.5449721","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.2009.5449721","startPage":"1727","endPage":"1731","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE 20th International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5443865/5449713/05449721.pdf","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE 20th International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5449713","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High throughput layered decoding of LDPC codes","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Sept. 2009","displayDocTitle":"High throughput layered decoding of LDPC codes","conferenceDate":"13-16 Sept. 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"15 April 2010","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5449721/","accessionNumber":"11244146","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5449721/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High throughput layered decoding of LDPC codes","confLoc":"Tokyo, Japan","sourcePdf":"1569226320.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041555S","chronDate":"13-16 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5443865","isNumber":"5449713","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5443865","xplore-issue":"5449713","articleId":"5449721","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":5449723,"authors":[{"name":"Mohammad Abdul Awal","affiliation":["LRI, University Paris-Sud, CNRS, Orsay, France"],"firstName":"Mohammad Abdul","lastName":"Awal","id":"37392106600"},{"name":"Lila Boukhatem","affiliation":["LRI, University Paris-Sud, CNRS, Orsay, France"],"firstName":"Lila","lastName":"Boukhatem","id":"37391799600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5122-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5123-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2166-9570"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2166-9589"}],"articleNumber":"5449723","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":61},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Performance analysis","Feedback","Downlink","Throughput","Bit error rate","Signal analysis","Base stations","Signal to noise ratio","Least squares methods","Resonance light scattering"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["error statistics","frequency division multiple access","least squares approximations","OFDM modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feedback prediction error","OFDMA downlink transmission","feedback reduction mechanism","base station","signal-to-noise ratio","recursive least square algorithm","adaptive modulation","average spectral efficiency","bit error rate"]}],"abstract":"In this paper we analyze the OFDMA downlink transmission performance of our proposed feedback (FB) reduction mechanism, where the base station (BS) predicts the FB (in terms of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)) to reduce the FB overhead, hence increases the uplink throughput.

This leads to interference limited systems where the interference is high at the cell edges. The key ingredient to such networks are thus receivers that are able to exploit the structure of this interference instead of nulling or attenuating it. In this paper we apply such a receiver structure to a distributed multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) scenario to decode two independent data streams from two synchronized base stations. Further we show how the distributed MIMO receiver is implemented in real-time on the OpenAirInterface platform and provide results from field trials and compare them to the simulation results. Applications of the distributed MIMO receiver include single-frequency cellular as well as mesh networks. OpenAirInterface is an experimental open-source real-time hardware and software platform for experimentation in wireless communications and signal processing. Its current implementation provides a full software modem comprising physical and link layer functionalities for cellular and mesh network topologies.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE 20th

bidder group auction mechanism for dynamic spectrum access","abstract":"In order to fully utilize spectrum, auction-based dynamic spectrum access has become a promising approach which allows unlicensed wireless users to lease unused bands from spectrum license holders. Traditionally, the property of spectrum goes to a unique winner with the highest bid after the auction, and the bidders with low bids would be probably not served. This also may result in spectrum resource wasting when the assigned band is larger than the original request. In fact, because the spectrum is divisible goods, it can be shared among a group of users. In this paper, we propose a novel virtual bidder group (VBG) mechanism in spectrum auction which allows multiple winners to obtain the spectrum item simultaneously. Furthermore, a heuristic phase-optimization algorithm is proposed to reduce the crucial exponential computing time issue of band allocation optimization in double-side bandwidth auction scenario with multiple auctioneers. Simulation results prove that the VBG scheme could significantly improve the realized system data rate and the bandwidth utility, which indicates higher revenue for the spectrum license holder; meanwhile, the proposed phase-optimization algorithm exhibits relative low complexity and could provide a near-optimal performance.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Sept. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5449727/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"11244152","publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","conferenceDate":"13-16 Sept. 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5449727/","dateOfInsertion":"15 April 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Virtual bidder group auction mechanism for dynamic spectrum access","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Virtual bidder group auction mechanism for dynamic spectrum access","confLoc":"Tokyo, Japan","sourcePdf":"1569226226.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.137845S","chronDate":"13-16 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5443865","isNumber":"5449713","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5443865","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"5449713","articleId":"5449727","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5449732,"authors":[{"name":"Li Wei","affiliation":["Centre for Wireless Communications, University of Oulu, Finland"],"firstName":"Li","lastName":"Wei","id":"37085920729"},{"name":"Matti Latva-aho","affiliation":["Centre for Wireless Communications, University of Oulu, Finland"],"firstName":"Matti","lastName":"Latva-aho","id":"37270610400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5122-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5123-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2166-9570"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2166-9589"}],"articleNumber":"5449732","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":3,"totalDownloads":230},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Broadcasting","Processor scheduling","Receiving antennas","Optimal scheduling","Singular value decomposition","Matrix decomposition","Scheduling algorithm","Algorithm design and analysis","Diversity methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["broadcasting","matrix inversion","MIMO communication","precoding","singular value decomposition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["generalized zero forcing precoder","multiuser MIMO broadcast communications","user scheduling problem","singular value decomposition based block diagonalization method","sum rate maximizing problem","channel pseudo inverse matrix","block diagonal matrix","suboptimal user scheduling algorithm","receive antenna selection","greedy user"]}],"abstract":"Generalized Zero Forcing (GZF) will be used in emerging commercial systems for Multi-User MIMO (MU-MIMO) broadcast communications. In this paper, the user scheduling problem related to it is studied. Instead of using Singular Value Decomposition based Block Diagonalization (SVD-BD) method, we construct the GZF precoder that optimally solves the Sum Rate Maximizing (SRMax) problem by a product of a channel pseudo inverse matrix and a block diagonal matrix. Later a Suboptimal User Scheduling (SUS) algorithm with Receive Antenna Selection (RAS) is designed by using a greedy user and antenna selection under SRMax and other simplified criteria. As the channel pseudo inverse can be sequentially calculated, the proposed algorithm is computationally efficient. It also achieves higher average sum rate which is verified by numerical simulations.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An efficient joint user and antenna selection for MIMO broadcast communications using Generalized Zero Forcing precoder","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE 20th International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications","doi":"10.1109/PIMRC.2009.5449732","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE 20th International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5443865/5449713/05449732.pdf","startPage":"1312","endPage":"1316","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.2009.5449732","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5449713","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5449732","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5449732/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Sept. 2009","displayDocTitle":"An efficient joint user and antenna selection for MIMO broadcast communications using Generalized Zero Forcing precoder","conferenceDate":"13-16 Sept. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5449732/","dateOfInsertion":"15 April 2010","publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"11244157","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An efficient joint user and antenna selection for MIMO broadcast communications using Generalized Zero Forcing precoder","confLoc":"Tokyo, Japan","sourcePdf":"1569225816.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062959S","chronDate":"13-16 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5443865","isNumber":"5449713","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5443865","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5449713","articleId":"5449732","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5449734,"authors":[{"name":"I Gutierrez","affiliation":["Samsung Electronics Research Institute (SERI), Advanced Technology, Standards and Regulation, London, UK"],"firstName":"I","lastName":"Gutierrez","id":"37300886000"},{"name":"F.

Clipping is a simple and efficient way of reducing PAPR. A suboptimal recursive clipping and filtering (RCF) method was proposed in [5] to reduce PAPR. This paper presents an alternate RCF approach which selects an error (clipping) vector that minimizes the peaks in both I- and Q-channels while satisfying some time and frequency domain distortion bounds. We formulate the design problem as a constrained linear programming (CLP) problem and extend it to include the tonereservation option. Like the RCF method, our approach does not need side information and incurs no data rate loss. Since the error vector used in RCF has not been optimized, our approach offers improved PAPR reduction. It also provide tradeoff between PAPR reduction and bit error rate (BER) degradation.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A linear programming approach for PAPR reduction in OFDM systems","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE 20th International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications","doi":"10.1109/PIMRC.2009.5449736","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE 20th International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5443865/5449713/05449736.pdf","startPage":"1667","endPage":"1671","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.2009.5449736","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5449713","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5449736","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5449736/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Sept. 2009","displayDocTitle":"A linear programming approach for PAPR reduction in OFDM systems","conferenceDate":"13-16 Sept. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5449736/","dateOfInsertion":"15 April 2010","publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"11244161","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A linear programming approach for PAPR reduction in OFDM systems","confLoc":"Tokyo, Japan","sourcePdf":"1569225562.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050099S","chronDate":"13-16 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5443865","isNumber":"5449713","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5443865","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5449713","articleId":"5449736","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5449737,"authors":[{"name":"Yang Zhang","affiliation":["Broadband Wireless Communications Laboratory, Information Science Institute, State Key Laboratory of Integrated Service Networks, Xidian University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Yang","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37405818200"},{"name":"Jiandong Li","affiliation":["Broadband Wireless Communications Laboratory, Information Science Institute, State Key Laboratory of Integrated Service Networks, Xidian University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Jiandong","lastName":"Li","id":"37279843400"},{"name":"Lihua Pang","affiliation":["Broadband Wireless Communications Laboratory, Information Science Institute, State Key Laboratory of Integrated Service Networks, Xidian University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Lihua","lastName":"Pang","id":"37396232400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5122-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5123-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2166-9570"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2166-9589"}],"articleNumber":"5449737","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":119},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5449737","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interference cancellation","Encoding","OFDM","Fading","Partial response channels","MIMO","Frequency domain analysis","Closed-form solution","Wireless communication","Robustness"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","encoding","intercarrier interference","interference suppression","MIMO communication","OFDM modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["intercarrier interference cancellation","partial response encoding","MIMO-OFDM systems","multiple-input multiple-output antennas","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","high data rate communications","carrier-to-interference ratio","time selective fading"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Intercarrier interference","multiple input multiple output","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","partial response coding","time selective fading"]}],"abstract":"Multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) antennas combined with orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) are very attractive for high data rate communications. However, MIMO-OFDM systems are very vulnerable to time selective fading as channel time variation destroys the orthogonality among subcarriers, causing serious intercarrier interference (ICI). In this paper, we employ optimal frequency domain partial response coding (PRC) in MIMO-OFDM systems over frequency selective, fast fading channels to mitigate ICI. We focus on deriving, via an analytical approach, a tractable, closed-form expression of carrier-to-interference ratio (CIR) to quantify the impact of time selective fading and demonstrate the effectiveness of PRC in mitigating ICI in MIMO-OFDM systems. From the numerical results, PRC can effectively increase CIR and the improvement is proportional to the number of subcarriers and the coding length.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5449713","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.2009.5449737","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE 20th International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE 20th International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5443865/5449713/05449737.pdf","startPage":"241","endPage":"245","doi":"10.1109/PIMRC.2009.5449737","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A scheme for cancelling intercarrier interference using partial response encoding for MIMO-OFDM systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Sept. 2009","displayDocTitle":"A scheme for cancelling intercarrier interference using partial response encoding for MIMO-OFDM systems","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"13-16 Sept. 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5449737/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"11244162","dateOfInsertion":"15 April 2010","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5449737/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A scheme for cancelling intercarrier interference using partial response encoding for MIMO-OFDM systems","confLoc":"Tokyo, Japan","sourcePdf":"1569225575.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059731S","chronDate":"13-16 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5443865","isNumber":"5449713","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5443865","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5449713","articleId":"5449737","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5449738,"authors":[{"name":"Chunhui Liu","affiliation":["Institute of Theoretical Information Technology, RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany"],"firstName":"Chunhui","lastName":"Liu","id":"37406604900"},{"name":"Anke Schmeink","affiliation":["UMIC Research Centre, RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany"],"firstName":"Anke","lastName":"Schmeink","id":"37391595400"},{"name":"Rudolf Mathar","affiliation":["Institute of Theoretical Information Technology, RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany"],"firstName":"Rudolf","lastName":"Mathar","id":"37271899400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5122-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5123-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2166-9570"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2166-9589"}],"articleNumber":"5449738","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":55},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Resource management","OFDM","Downlink","Performance loss","Fading","Bit error rate","Quadrature amplitude modulation","Base stations","Information technology","Acceleration"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multi-access systems","OFDM modulation","radio links","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["linear complexity resource allocation method","heterogeneous multiuser OFDM downlink","heterogeneous transmission","multiuser orthogonal frequency division multiplexing downlink","real time transmission","time varying channels"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we consider the dynamic power and rate allocation for the heterogeneous transmission over multiuser orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) downlink, where users may require real time or non-real time transmission. The data rate for the real time transmission is lower bounded, while the total transmission power for both transmissions is limited to a fixed amount. Solutions to this problem must be computationally efficient in order to adapt to the fast time-varying channels in practice. To accelerate the resource allocation for the considered scenario, efficient approaches are given to update the power or rate variation while changing subcarrier assignments. By iteratively using these approaches, a resource allocation method is proposed to achieve a good balance between the performance and the complexity. Its complexity is linearly increasing in the number of subcarriers and the number of users. Simulation results demonstrate that our method has small performance loss compared to the dual optimum and achieves much better performance compared to previous works.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A linear-complexity resource allocation method for heterogeneous multiuser OFDM downlink","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE 20th International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications","doi":"10.1109/PIMRC.2009.5449738","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE 20th International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5443865/5449713/05449738.pdf","startPage":"2591","endPage":"2596","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.2009.5449738","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5449713","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5449738","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5449738/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Sept. 2009","displayDocTitle":"A linear-complexity resource allocation method for heterogeneous multiuser OFDM downlink","conferenceDate":"13-16 Sept. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5449738/","dateOfInsertion":"15 April 2010","publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"11244163","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A linear-complexity resource allocation method for heterogeneous multiuser OFDM downlink","confLoc":"Tokyo, Japan","sourcePdf":"1569225108.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073151S","chronDate":"13-16 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5443865","isNumber":"5449713","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5443865","xplore-issue":"5449713","articleId":"5449738","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5449739,"authors":[{"name":"Tadeusz Wysocki","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Information Engineering, University of Sydney, NSW, Australia"],"firstName":"Tadeusz","lastName":"Wysocki","id":"37280338700"},{"name":"Abbas Jamalipour","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Information Engineering, University of Sydney, NSW, Australia"],"firstName":"Abbas","lastName":"Jamalipour","id":"37275028900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5122-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5123-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2166-9570"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2166-9589"}],"articleNumber":"5449739","dbTime":"32 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":103},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5449739","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cognitive radio","Chromium","Interference","Vehicle dynamics","Disruption tolerant networking","Australia","Wireless networks","Routing protocols","Throughput","Potential well"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["access protocols","cognitive radio","routing protocols"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["intermittently connected cognitive radio networks","cognitive radio","information dissemination protocols","routing protocols","MAC throughput","network partition"]}],"doi":"10.1109/PIMRC.2009.5449739","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE 20th International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE 20th International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5443865/5449713/05449739.pdf","startPage":"481","endPage":"485","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.2009.5449739","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5449713","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"MAC framework for Intermittently Connected Cognitive Radio networks","abstract":"This paper presents a customizable framework for employing Cognitive Radio in Intermittently Connected Wireless Networks, which aims to maximize transmission opportunities that arise when fully connected network partitions are formed.

The technique has been extended to CDMA systems operating in multiple input multiple output (MIMO) channels. In previous work, Hadamard codes are used for spreading. In this paper, we propose assigning each user the same set of Hadamard sequences while employing a unique Gold scrambling code. This reduces the overall number of codes required while making the system more robust to frequency selective fading. Compared to a conventional MIMO-CDMA system, the proposed combination of spreading codes allows both increase in data rates and decrease number of needed spreading codes by a factor of 4.

Both analytical and simulation results show that the proposed scheme achieves a full diversity gain and outperforms the amplify-and-forward (AF) scheme significantly, owing to its efficient use of the relay transmit power and matched excellent performance of the two stages.","doi":"10.1109/PIMRC.2009.5449742","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE 20th International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE 20th International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5443865/5449713/05449742.pdf","startPage":"1717","endPage":"1721","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.2009.5449742","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5449713","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An optimized network coding scheme in two-way relay channels with multiple relay antennas","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5449742","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Sept. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5449742/","displayDocTitle":"An optimized network coding scheme in two-way relay channels with multiple relay antennas","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"11244167","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5449742/","conferenceDate":"13-16 Sept. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"15 April 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An optimized network coding scheme in two-way relay channels with multiple relay antennas","confLoc":"Tokyo, Japan","sourcePdf":"1569224910.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.081834S","chronDate":"13-16 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5443865","isNumber":"5449713","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5443865","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"5449713","articleId":"5449742","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5449743,"authors":[{"name":"Andreas Ahrens","affiliation":["Hochschule Wismar, Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of Technology, Business and Design, Wismar, Germany"],"firstName":"Andreas","lastName":"Ahrens","id":"37331107900"},{"name":"C\u00e9sar Benavente-Peces","affiliation":["E.U.I.T de Telecomunicaci\u00f3n, Universidad Polit\u00e9cnica de Madrid, Madrid, Spain"],"firstName":"C\u00e9sar","lastName":"Benavente-Peces","id":"38276407300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5122-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5123-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2166-9570"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2166-9589"}],"articleNumber":"5449743","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":38},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Constraint optimization","Throughput","Frequency","Interleaved codes","Modulation coding","Constellation diagram","Signal mapping","Information analysis","Convergence"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["frequency selective surfaces","interleaved codes","iterative decoding","MIMO communication","radio links"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO-BICM schemes","power assignment","frequency selective MIMO links","spatio-temporal vector coding","bit-interleaved coded irregular modulation","extrinsic information transfer charts","iterative demapping"]}],"abstract":"In this contribution we jointly optimize the number of activated MIMO layers and the number of bits per symbol along with the appropriate allocation of the transmit power under the constraint of a given fixed data throughput and integrity.

By contrast, frequency selective MIMO links require substantial further research, where spatio-temporal vector coding (STVC) introduced by Raleigh seems to be an appropriate candidate for broadband transmission channels. In analogy to bit-interleaved coded irregular modulation, we introduce a MIMO-BICM scheme, where different signal constellations and mappings are used within a single codeword.

The optimal user selection algorithm is to try all the combinations of users to find the user group that can achieve the multiuser diversity. However, the calculation amount of the optimal algorithm is too large to implement. Thus, instead of the optimal algorithm, some suboptimal user selection algorithms were proposed based on semiorthogonality of user channel vectors. The purpose of this paper is to achieve multiuser diversity with a small amount of calculation. For this purpose, we propose a user selection algorithm that can improve the orthogonality of a selected user group. Simulation results show that the proposed user selection algorithm achieves higher sum rate capacity than the SUS (Semiorthogonal User Selection) algorithm. As the result of a discussion on the calculation complexity, the proposed algorithm is shown to have a calculation complexity almost equal to that of the SUS algorithm, and they are much lower than that of the optimal user selection algorithm.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE 20th International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5443865/5449713/05449749.pdf","startPage":"192","endPage":"196","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE 20th International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications","doi":"10.1109/PIMRC.2009.5449749","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.2009.5449749","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5449713","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5449749","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An improved user selection algorithm in multiuser MIMO broadcast","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Broadcasting","Interference","Computer science","Base stations","Predictive models","Channel state information"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["broadcasting","communication complexity","diversity reception","MIMO communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["user selection algorithm","multiuser MIMO broadcast","multiple-input multiple- output broadcasting","multiuser diversity","suboptimal user selection algorithms","semiorthogonal user selection","calculation complexity"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5449749/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Sept. 2009","displayDocTitle":"An improved user selection algorithm in multiuser MIMO broadcast","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5449749/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"11244174","dateOfInsertion":"15 April 2010","conferenceDate":"13-16 Sept. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An improved user selection algorithm in multiuser MIMO broadcast","confLoc":"Tokyo, Japan","sourcePdf":"1569223684.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.037241S","chronDate":"13-16 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5443865","isNumber":"5449713","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5443865","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"5449713","articleId":"5449749","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":5449750,"authors":[{"name":"Pengfei Sun","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University of Leeds, Leeds, UK"],"firstName":"Pengfei","lastName":"Sun","id":"37396760300"},{"name":"Li Zhang","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University of Leeds, Leeds, UK"],"firstName":"Li","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37280172300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5122-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5123-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2166-9570"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2166-9589"}],"articleNumber":"5449750","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":67},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Frequency estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["communication complexity","convergence","frequency division multiple access","frequency estimation","interference suppression","iterative methods","OFDM modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["tile-based iterative carrier frequency estimation","OFDMA uplink transmissions","orthogonal frequency division multiple access uplink systems","subcarrier allocation","tile-structure based iterative multiCFO estimation technique","multiuser interference compression","interference cancellation scheme","fast convergence","subcarrier assignment schemes","Cramer Rao bound"]}],"abstract":"This paper examines the carrier frequency offset (CFO) estimation problem in the orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) uplink systems, which is very challenging due to the presence of multiple CFOs. The existing solutions to this problem are either too complex to implement or not flexible in subcarrier allocation. To solve these problems, this paper proposes a tile-structure based iterative multi-CFO estimation technique. The proposed method is developed based on a special training sequence with repetitive structure. The inherent multi-user interference (MUI) compression provided by the tile structure allows us to utilize the repetitive property of the training sequence to jointly estimate the CFOs in the frequency domain with low complexity. Combining the CFO estimation with an interference cancellation scheme and performing iteratively, the algorithm achieves high estimation accuracy and fast convergence. The proposed algorithm is suitable for any subcarrier assignment schemes. In addition, as compared with other existing time domain based algorithms, which achieve the Cramer Rao Bound (CRB) at the price of unaffordable complexity, it closely matches their performance with over 70% computational saving.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Tile-based iterative carrier frequency estimation for OFDMA uplink transmissions","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE 20th International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications","doi":"10.1109/PIMRC.2009.5449750","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE 20th International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5443865/5449713/05449750.pdf","startPage":"1992","endPage":"1996","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.2009.5449750","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5449713","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5449750","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5449750/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Sept. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Tile-based iterative carrier frequency estimation for OFDMA uplink transmissions","conferenceDate":"13-16 Sept. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5449750/","dateOfInsertion":"15 April 2010","publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"11244216","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Tile-based iterative carrier frequency estimation for OFDMA uplink transmissions","confLoc":"Tokyo, Japan","sourcePdf":"1569223326.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.099643S","chronDate":"13-16 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5443865","isNumber":"5449713","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5443865","xplore-issue":"5449713","articleId":"5449750","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5449751,"authors":[{"name":"Patrick Hosein","affiliation":["Huawei Technologies Company Limited, San Diego, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Patrick","lastName":"Hosein","id":"37269132200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5122-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5123-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2166-9570"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2166-9589"}],"articleNumber":"5449751","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":124},"abstract":"We consider the downlink of an Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access (OFDMA) network. OFDMA transmission technology will be used in the next generation of wireless networks such as the LTE (Long Term Evolution) and WiMAX wireless standards. In such a channel, multiple User Equipments (UE) may each be allocated multiple Resource Blocks (RBs) in each frame. A RB is a collection of subcarriers spanned over all symbols that are available for data transmission. For each UE we assign a utility function that depends on the UE's average throughput. Such a function can be used to achieve specified Quality of Service (QoS) guarantees of the UE. We are concerned with the optimal allocation of power and bandwidth in each sector with the objective of maximizing the sum utility over all UEs in all sectors. Note that since we are considering sector-wide performance then the influence of intersector interference is also taken into account. In general, this problem is intractable and so we focus on the two-sector case. We determine an upper bound on performance for any set of utility functions and for any strategy for scheduling, power control and interference management. This bound can therefore be used to evaluate the optimality of any particular strategy.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE 20th International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5443865/5449713/05449751.pdf","startPage":"1376","endPage":"1380","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE 20th International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications","doi":"10.1109/PIMRC.2009.5449751","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.2009.5449751","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5449713","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5449751","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"System capacity of a two-sector OFDMA downlink with QoS constraints","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Downlink","Quality of service","Interference","Frequency conversion","Next generation networking","Wireless networks","Long Term Evolution","WiMAX","Resource management","Data communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bandwidth allocation","channel capacity","data communication equipment","frequency division multiple access","OFDM modulation","quality of service","resource allocation","telecommunication control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["orthogonal frequency division multiple access","OFDMA","next generation wireless networks","multiple user equipments","multiple resource block allocation","data transmission","quality of service","optimal bandwidth allocation","optimal power allocation","power control","system capacity","QoS"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5449751/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Sept. 2009","displayDocTitle":"System capacity of a two-sector OFDMA downlink with QoS constraints","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5449751/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"11244217","dateOfInsertion":"15 April 2010","conferenceDate":"13-16 Sept. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"System capacity of a two-sector OFDMA downlink with QoS constraints","confLoc":"Tokyo, Japan","sourcePdf":"1569223454.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056734S","chronDate":"13-16 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5443865","isNumber":"5449713","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5443865","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5449713","articleId":"5449751","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5449755,"authors":[{"name":"Chen-Jiu Hsu","affiliation":["Department of Communication Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chen-Jiu","lastName":"Hsu","id":"37402566500"},{"name":"Wern-Ho Sheen","affiliation":["Department of Communication Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Wern-Ho","lastName":"Sheen","id":"37277915500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5122-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5123-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2166-9570"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2166-9589"}],"articleNumber":"5449755","dbTime":"16 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":119},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Receivers","Radio transmitters","Frequency estimation","Transmitting antennas","MIMO","OFDM","Receiving antennas","Chaotic communication","Frequency division multiplexing","Radio transceivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["least squares approximations","MIMO communication","OFDM modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compensation","transmitter radio impairments","receiver radio impairments","MIMO-OFDM receivers","multiple input multiple output systems","least squares estimation","transmit antennas","receive antennas","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing systems"]}],"abstract":"This paper aims to improve the performance of estimation and compensation for both the transmitter and receiver radio impairments in the MIMO-OFDM (multiple-input, multiple-output orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing) systems.

Spectrum sensing is the key functionality to make sure that the cognitive radio is aware and will not disturb the operation of the licensed users. Collaborative spectrum sensing is needed to overcome deleterious channel effects such as fading or the hidden node problem and to increase sensing reliability and accuracy. This paper presents a novel optimisation framework for collaborative spectrum sensing in the presence of imperfect reporting channels. It is also shown in this paper that in fading channels spectrum sensing performance can be significantly improved by using multiple antennas at the cognitive radio terminal. A weighted optimised collaborative spectrum sensing scheme with multiple antenna cognitive terminals, which maximises global probability of detection at the fusion centre using genetic algorithm is presented. Based on an individual user local conditions, the algorithm assigns optimal weight to the user observation at the fusion centre.

In practical systems, the precoding matrix is computed at the receiver, and then fed back to the transmitter. To reduce the amount of the feedback data, only the index representing a quantized precoding matrix is fed back. The quantized matrix is selected from a set of predetermined matrices called a codebook. Since the number of matrices in the codebook may be large, the search for the optimum precoder requires a high computational complexity. In this paper, we propose a low-complexity precoder searching algorithm to solve the problem.

In this paper, we will propose a low computational complexity distributed relay selection and subchannel pairing algorithms under limited channel state information.

However, the performance of the QRM-MLD algorithm will deteriorate with the increasing of the number of transmit antennas, as well as the decreasing of the number of the selected nodes in each stage due to the abandoning of some hypotheses in each step of the tree search. To solve this problem, we modify the QR decomposition method through rearranging the channel columns based on the post-detection signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), which makes the process of the abandoning more reliable.

The main design criteria for the radar component are accuracy of distance and speed measurements, whereas the communication subsystem needs to be designed such that it transmits robustly through a mobile communication channel.

To detect an event with small changes of signal subspace components, we emphasize the changes of signal subspace components by selecting an appropriate component of signal subspace with signal-subspace partition. In addition, to detect an event in the presence of the changes of signal subspace components due to some undesired movements, such as by a pet, we mask or attenuate the changes of signal subspace components by selecting an appropriate component of signal subspace with signal-subspace partition. In the proposed method, firstly, we estimate direction of arrival (DOA) to obtain the basis of the signal subspace. Next, we make the parted signal subspace by combining each base of the signal subspace. The parted signal subspace is used as the filter. The experimental results reveal that the proposed method can emphasize or mask or attenuate events using signal-subspace partition.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Signal-subspace-partition event filtering for eigenvector-based security system using radio waves","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE 20th International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications","doi":"10.1109/PIMRC.2009.5449774","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE 20th International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5443865/5449713/05449774.pdf","startPage":"2792","endPage":"2796","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.2009.5449774","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5449713","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5449774","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5449774/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Sept. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Signal-subspace-partition event filtering for eigenvector-based security system using radio waves","conferenceDate":"13-16 Sept. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5449774/","dateOfInsertion":"15 April 2010","publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"11244240","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Signal-subspace-partition event filtering for eigenvector-based security system using radio waves","confLoc":"Tokyo, Japan","sourcePdf":"1569200753.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060935S","chronDate":"13-16 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5443865","isNumber":"5449713","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5443865","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"5449713","articleId":"5449774","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5449775,"authors":[{"name":"Chun-Tao Lin","affiliation":["Department of Communication Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chun-Tao","lastName":"Lin","id":"37404174400"},{"name":"Wen-Rong Wu","affiliation":["Department of Communication Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Wen-Rong","lastName":"Wu","id":"37280430600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5122-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5123-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2166-9570"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2166-9589"}],"articleNumber":"5449775","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":244},"abstract":"Antenna selection is a simple but effective method to exploit the transmit diversity in multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) wireless communications. For maximum-likelihood (ML) detectors, the criterion for the selection is to maximize the free distance of the MIMO system. Since the optimum selection is difficult to conduct, a lower bound of the free distance is typically used as the selection criterion instead. The singular-value-decomposition (SVD) based selection criterion is well known in the literature. In this paper, we propose a QR decomposition (QRD) based selection criterion for antenna selection with the ML detector. Using some matrix properties, we theoretically prove that the lower bound achieved with the QRD-based criterion is tighter than that with the SVD-based criterion. We also propose another QRD-based criterion that can further tighten the lower bound. The proposed algorithms can be directly applied to the receive, and joint transmit/receive antenna selection schemes. Simulations show that the performance of the proposed selection criteria can significantly outperform the SVD-based selection criterion.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE 20th International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5443865/5449713/05449775.pdf","startPage":"2016","endPage":"2020","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE 20th International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications","doi":"10.1109/PIMRC.2009.5449775","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.2009.5449775","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5449713","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5449775","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"QRD-based antenna selection for maximum-likelihood MIMO detection","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Maximum likelihood detection","MIMO","Receiving antennas","Transmitting antennas","Transmitters","Wireless communication","Detectors","Matrix decomposition","Antenna feeds","Switches"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antennas","maximum likelihood detection","MIMO communication","radiocommunication","singular value decomposition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["QRD based antenna selection criterion","maximum likelihood MIMO detection","transmit diversity","multiple input multiple output wireless communication","maximum likelihood detectors","optimum selection","singular value decomposition","transmit antenna selection","receive antenna selection","SVD based selection criterion"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5449775/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Sept. 2009","displayDocTitle":"QRD-based antenna selection for maximum-likelihood MIMO detection","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5449775/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"11244241","dateOfInsertion":"15 April 2010","conferenceDate":"13-16 Sept. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"QRD-based antenna selection for maximum-likelihood MIMO detection","confLoc":"Tokyo, Japan","sourcePdf":"1569201391.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058541S","chronDate":"13-16 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5443865","isNumber":"5449713","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5443865","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"5449713","articleId":"5449775","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":5449779,"authors":[{"name":"Khiam-Boon Png","affiliation":["Institute of Infocomm Research (I2R), National University of Singapore, Singapore"],"firstName":"Khiam-Boon","lastName":"Png","id":"37264958900"},{"name":"Xiaoming Peng","affiliation":["Institute for Infocomm Research, Singapore"],"firstName":"Xiaoming","lastName":"Peng","id":"37280077300"},{"name":"Francois Chin","affiliation":["Institute for Infocomm Research, Singapore"],"firstName":"Francois","lastName":"Chin","id":"37280075500"},{"name":"Chi Chung Ko","affiliation":["National University of Singapore, Singapore"],"firstName":"Chi Chung","lastName":"Ko","id":"37279881600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5122-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5123-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2166-9570"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2166-9589"}],"articleNumber":"5449779","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":53},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5449779","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Decoding","Detectors","Bit error rate","Probability","Frequency conversion","Statistics","Computational efficiency","MIMO","Computational modeling","Frequency domain analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decoding","error statistics","frequency division multiple access","maximum likelihood detection","MIMO communication","trees (mathematics)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["soft QRD-M decoding","coded IFDMA systems","a posterior probability detector","breadth-first tree search algorithm","QR decomposition","bit error rate","MIMO system","frequency domain equalizer","BER performance","maximum channel diversity order","interleaved frequency division multiple access"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, a low complexity a posterior probability (APP) detector based on breadth-first tree search algorithm is purposed for coded interleaved frequency division multiple access (IFDMA) system.

Compared to existing detection algorithms, the proposed algorithm provides a new viewpoint of reducing the receiver detection complexity in high order MIMO systems. With the proper parameters, the OGNO can achieve the almost same performance as the optimal maximum likelihood detection (MLD) algorithm but much lower complexity. Meanwhile, the fixed computational complexity offers a practical real-time hardware implementation. The advantage of complexity reduction comes from the orthogonal grouping, which can convert a higher order MIMO system into several lower order MIMO systems, where each subsystem can also be viewed a group. These groups perform detection separately. Due to more than one candidate sequence output from each group, the overall optimal sequence is obtained through ranking combination static group search. The bit error performance evaluation of the proposed algorithm is given by computer simulation and its complexity is evaluated by measuring the total number of floating-point operations (flops). Furthermore, it will be implemented into our real-time FGPA 8\u00d78 MIMO-OFDM test-bed and the results from RF experiments will be given in the future.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Orthogonal grouping-based near optimal detection algorithm for high order MIMO systems","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE 20th International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications","doi":"10.1109/PIMRC.2009.5449781","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE 20th International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5443865/5449713/05449781.pdf","startPage":"2499","endPage":"2503","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.2009.5449781","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5449713","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5449781","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5449781/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Sept. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Orthogonal grouping-based near optimal detection algorithm for high order MIMO systems","conferenceDate":"13-16 Sept. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5449781/","dateOfInsertion":"15 April 2010","publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"11244247","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Orthogonal grouping-based near optimal detection algorithm for high order MIMO systems","confLoc":"Tokyo, Japan","sourcePdf":"1569226708.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.078169S","chronDate":"13-16 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5443865","isNumber":"5449713","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5443865","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"5449713","articleId":"5449781","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5449782,"authors":[{"name":"Eun Jin Hong","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejeon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Eun Jin","lastName":"Hong","id":"38258259000"},{"name":"Se Young Yun","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejeon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Se Young","lastName":"Yun","id":"37708937300"},{"name":"Dong-Ho Cho","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejeon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Dong-Ho","lastName":"Cho","id":"37276179200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5122-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5123-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2166-9570"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2166-9589"}],"articleNumber":"5449782","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":72,"citationCountPatent":3,"totalDownloads":1136},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power control","Femtocell networks","Game theory","Interference","Power system modeling","Macrocell networks","Computer science","Electronic mail","Steady-state","Nash equilibrium"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","decentralised control","game theory","interference suppression","mathematical analysis","power control","telecommunication control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decentralized power control scheme","game theoretic approach","closed access femtocell networks","macro cell area","macro users","down-link","noncooperative game model","interference minimization","Nash equilibrium","mathematical analysis","distributed power control scheme"]}],"abstract":"We propose a new distributed power control scheme for closed access femtocell networks.

We show that nonlinear MIMO amplitude receivers loose half the available receive diversity when the uncoded transmission rate increases above 1 bit/s/Hz, or when spatial multiplexing is performed.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Diversity and spatial multiplexing of MIMO amplitude detection receivers","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE 20th International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications","doi":"10.1109/PIMRC.2009.5449784","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE 20th International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5443865/5449713/05449784.pdf","startPage":"202","endPage":"206","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.2009.5449784","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5449713","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5449784","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5449784/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Sept. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Diversity and spatial multiplexing of MIMO amplitude detection receivers","conferenceDate":"13-16 Sept. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5449784/","dateOfInsertion":"15 April 2010","publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"11244250","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Diversity and spatial multiplexing of MIMO amplitude detection receivers","confLoc":"Tokyo, Japan","sourcePdf":"1569226753.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041553S","chronDate":"13-16 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5443865","isNumber":"5449713","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5443865","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"5449713","articleId":"5449784","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":5449789,"authors":[{"name":"Mohammad Iqbal","affiliation":["Monash University, Clayton, VIC, AU"],"firstName":"Mohammad","lastName":"Iqbal"},{"name":"Bin Shahid","affiliation":["Monash University, Clayton, VIC, AU"],"firstName":"Bin","lastName":"Shahid"},{"name":"Joarder Kamruzzaman","affiliation":["Monash University, Clayton, VIC, AU"],"firstName":"Joarder","lastName":"Kamruzzaman","id":"37280440800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5122-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5123-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2166-9570"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2166-9589"}],"articleNumber":"5449789","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":104},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Radio frequency","Fading","Shadow mapping","Cognitive radio","White spaces","Licenses","Radio transmitters","FCC","Chromium","Radio spectrum management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fading","radio spectrum management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["realistic RF environment","fixed spectrum licensing policies","RF spectrum demand","spectrum access","identical fading","shadowing channels","cooperative spectrum sensing technique","nonlicensee user contribution"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cooperative spectrum sensing in realistic RF environment","doi":"10.1109/PIMRC.2009.5449789","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5449713","endPage":"2294","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE 20th International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE 20th International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5443865/5449713/05449789.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.2009.5449789","startPage":"2290","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5449789","abstract":"Fixed spectrum licensing policies are unsuitable to meet RF spectrum demand by emerging technologies. Spectrum scarcity is hindering the enhancement of current services or deployment of new services operating in RF spectrum. On the contrary, many portions of the licensed spectrum remain unused or underused for significant period of time creating possibility of opportunistic spectrum access without license. Spectrum sensing is practiced in most of the existing opportunistic spectrum access methods. However, these methods consider identical fading or shadowing channels and ignore spatial variation of unlicensed users, hence fail to capture realistic scenario. We introduce an improved cooperative spectrum sensing technique which incorporates non-identical fading and shadowing, and weighs each non-licensee user's contribution appropriately considering the received power and positional displacements of the users. The proposed method demonstrates better detection accuracy and higher spectrum utilization with fewer cooperating users than other existing methods.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5449789/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Sept. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"15 April 2010","accessionNumber":"11244255","htmlLink":"/document/5449789/","conferenceDate":"13-16 Sept. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Cooperative spectrum sensing in realistic RF environment","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cooperative spectrum sensing in realistic RF environment","confLoc":"Tokyo, Japan","sourcePdf":"1569226838.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055139S","chronDate":"13-16 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5443865","isNumber":"5449713","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5443865","xplore-issue":"5449713","articleId":"5449789","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5449793,"authors":[{"name":"Zhenyu Zhou","affiliation":["Graduate School of Global Information and Telecommunication Studiesl, WasedaUniversity, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Zhenyu","lastName":"Zhou","id":"37404367100"},{"name":"Takuro Sato","affiliation":["Graduate School of Global Information and Telecommunication Studiesl, WasedaUniversity, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Takuro","lastName":"Sato","id":"38266678500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5122-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5123-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2166-9570"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2166-9589"}],"articleNumber":"5449793","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":225},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A blind single antenna interference cancellation algorithm for asynchronous OFDM communication systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE 20th International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5443865/5449713/05449793.pdf","startPage":"1226","endPage":"1230","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE 20th International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.2009.5449793","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5449713","doi":"10.1109/PIMRC.2009.5449793","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interference cancellation","OFDM"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antennas","blind equalisers","cochannel interference","interference suppression","least mean squares methods","maximum likelihood sequence estimation","OFDM modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["blind single antenna interference cancellation algorithm","asynchronous OFDM communication systems","cochannel interference","cellular systems","base stations","frequency channel","bit error rate","mobile receivers","CCI cancellation algorithms","asynchronous interfering signal","least mean square-blind joint maximum likelihood sequence estimation","training sequence","channel length","BER"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5449793","abstract":"In orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) based cellular systems, co-channel interference (CCI) from adjacent interfering base stations (BSs) operating and coexisting with the desired BS in the same frequency channel would greatly degrade the bit error rate (BER) performance of mobile receivers which are near to cell borders. CCI cancellation algorithms by using only one receiving antenna named single antenna interference cancellation (SAIC) have been under intense research. However, most of these algorithms require additional information from interfering signals. Furthermore, the orthogonality of a asynchronous interfering signal is destroyed and therefore, conventional SAIC algorithms cannot be applied. In this paper, we propose a blind SAIC algorithm named least mean square-blind joint maximum likelihood sequence estimation (LMS-BJMLSE) for asynchronous interference cancellation. The proposed LMS-BJMLSE algorithm is blind with respect to interfering signals and neither the training sequence (TS) nor pilot signal from interfering signals is needed. Its complexity is independent of channel length compared to the conventional time domain JMLSE algorithm. Simulation results show that the proposed LMS-BJMLSE algorithm could greatly improve the BER performance in both synchronous and asynchronous interference conditions.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5449793/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Sept. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"11244346","htmlLink":"/document/5449793/","dateOfInsertion":"15 April 2010","conferenceDate":"13-16 Sept. 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A blind single antenna interference cancellation algorithm for asynchronous OFDM communication systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A blind single antenna interference cancellation algorithm for asynchronous OFDM communication systems","confLoc":"Tokyo, Japan","sourcePdf":"1569226900.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.094135S","chronDate":"13-16 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5443865","isNumber":"5449713","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5443865","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"5449713","articleId":"5449793","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-13"},{"_id":5449795,"authors":[{"name":"Lanlan He","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Lanlan","lastName":"He","id":"37395564600"},{"name":"Shaodan Ma","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Shaodan","lastName":"Ma","id":"37280187300"},{"name":"Yik-Chung Wu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Yik-Chung","lastName":"Wu","id":"37281222900"},{"name":"Tung-Sang Ng","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Tung-Sang","lastName":"Ng","id":"37280168200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5122-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5123-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2166-9570"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2166-9589"}],"articleNumber":"5449795","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":267},"abstract":"In this paper, a joint channel estimation and data detection algorithm is proposed for OFDM systems under doubly selective channels (DSCs).

Basically, it is an iterative algorithm including two steps at each iteration. In the first step, the unknown coefficients in K-L BEM are first integrated out to obtain a function which only depends on data, and meanwhile, a maximum a posteriori (MAP) channel estimator is obtained. In the second step, data are directly detected by a novel approach based on the function obtained in the first step. Moreover, a Bayesian Cramer-Rao Lower Bound (BCRB) which is valid for any channel estimator is also derived to evaluate the performance of the proposed channel estimator.

Using distribution functions for finite dimensional matrices, we conduct exact analysis on the performance of the proposed detector. Essentially, the detection problem requires characterizing the decision threshold as a function of various parameters. The threshold optimization problem is characterized by a weighted sum of false alarm and miss detection probabilities.

The system performance degrades more severely as normalized Doppler frequency increases. In order to mitigate the effect of time-varying fading, a low-complexity iterative receiver with joint ICI cancellation and pilot-assisted channel estimation is proposed. The initial channel state information (CSI) is estimated by performing time-domain interpolation and least-square (LS) method on the received pilot symbols. The soft outputs are obtained from the decoders after low-complexity linear minimum mean-square error (LC-LMMSE) detection. In the following stages, the soft outputs are feedback to update the CSI estimation. Furthermore, a \u00bflinear statistics combining\u00bf (LSC) technique is used to improve the performance of the proposed equalizer by combining the outputs of LC-LMMSE and parallel interference canceler (PIC) with weighting coefficients estimated by maximizing the signal to interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) at the output of LSC. The complexity of system is significantly reduced by restricting the interference to neighboring subcarriers and employing the LC-LMMSE by limiting the frequency-domain CSI into diagonal region. The simulation results show that the proposed iterative receiver with estimated CSI approaches the ICI-free bound even at very high mobility scenarios.","doi":"10.1109/PIMRC.2009.5449800","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE 20th International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE 20th International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5443865/5449713/05449800.pdf","startPage":"1997","endPage":"2001","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.2009.5449800","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5449713","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A low complexity iterative receiver with joint channel estimation and ICI cancellation for multi-antenna OFDM systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5449800","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Sept. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5449800/","displayDocTitle":"A low complexity iterative receiver with joint channel estimation and ICI cancellation for multi-antenna OFDM systems","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"11244353","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5449800/","conferenceDate":"13-16 Sept. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"15 April 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A low complexity iterative receiver with joint channel estimation and ICI cancellation for multi-antenna OFDM systems","confLoc":"Tokyo, Japan","sourcePdf":"1569227065.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056596S","chronDate":"13-16 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5443865","isNumber":"5449713","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5443865","xplore-issue":"5449713","articleId":"5449800","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5449801,"authors":[{"name":"Nan Yang","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Telecommunications, University of New South Wales, NSW, Australia","School of Information and Electronics, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Nan","lastName":"Yang","id":"37407136200"},{"name":"Maged Elkashlan","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Telecommunications, University of New South Wales, NSW, Australia","Wireless Technologies Laboratory, CSIRO ICT Centre, Marsfield, NSW, Australia"],"firstName":"Maged","lastName":"Elkashlan","id":"37269057400"},{"name":"Jinhong Yuan","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Telecommunications, University of New South Wales, NSW, Australia"],"firstName":"Jinhong","lastName":"Yuan","id":"37281352700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5122-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5123-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2166-9570"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2166-9589"}],"articleNumber":"5449801","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":152},"abstract":"In this paper, we consider the performance of downlink multiuser relay networks (MRN) equipped with a single amplify-and-forward (AaF) relay.

Numerical results substantiate the validity of our analysis.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Relays","Fading","Rayleigh channels","Downlink","Wireless networks","Information analysis","Performance analysis","Australia","Channel state information","Distribution functions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Nakagami channels","probability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CSI-based amplify-and-forward relaying","Nakagami-m fading channels","downlink multiuser relay networks","outage probability","channel state information-based gain relaying","cumulative distribution function","signal-to-noise ratio"]}],"doi":"10.1109/PIMRC.2009.5449801","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE 20th International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE 20th International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5443865/5449713/05449801.pdf","startPage":"256","endPage":"260","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5449713","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.2009.5449801","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Outage analysis of multiuser relay networks with CSI-based amplify-and-forward relaying in Nakagami-m fading channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5449801","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Outage analysis of multiuser relay networks with CSI-based amplify-and-forward relaying in Nakagami-m fading channels","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5449801/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5449801/","accessionNumber":"11244354","conferenceDate":"13-16 Sept. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"15 April 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Sept. 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Outage analysis of multiuser relay networks with CSI-based amplify-and-forward relaying in Nakagami-m fading channels","confLoc":"Tokyo, Japan","sourcePdf":"1569227072.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062176S","chronDate":"13-16 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5443865","isNumber":"5449713","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5443865","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5449713","articleId":"5449801","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5449802,"authors":[{"name":"Handayani Sartono","affiliation":["Institute of Infocomm Research, Agency for Science, Technology and Research, Singapore","Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, National University of Singapore, Singapore"],"firstName":"Handayani","lastName":"Sartono","id":"37392289200"},{"name":"Yong Huat Chew","affiliation":["Institute of Infocomm Research, Agency for Science, Technology and Research, Singapore"],"firstName":"Yong Huat","lastName":"Chew","id":"37280653600"},{"name":"Woon Hau Chin","affiliation":["Telecommunications Research Laboratory, Toshiba Research Europe Limited, UK"],"firstName":"Woon Hau","lastName":"Chin","id":"37331357200"},{"name":"Chau Yuen","affiliation":["Institute of Infocomm Research, Agency for Science, Technology and Research, Singapore"],"firstName":"Chau","lastName":"Yuen","id":"37273147100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5122-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5123-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2166-9570"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2166-9589"}],"articleNumber":"5449802","dbTime":"18 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":285},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Pricing","Bandwidth","Game theory","Wireless networks","Iterative algorithms","WiMAX","Europe","Electric variables measurement","Resource management","Supply and demand"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","game theory","radio spectrum management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["joint demand-supply auction pricing strategy","dynamic spectrum sharing","radio spectrum allocation","spectrum utilization efficiency","spectrum auction game","spectrum supplier","bandwidth bidders","open bid auction theory","equilibrium point"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Non-cooperative game","Double auction","Variable supply auction","Dynamic spectrum sharing","Private commons"]}],"abstract":"Conclusion drawn from field measurement is that the allocation of radio spectrum to operators in a static manner does not make efficient use of the scarce spectrum resources. Dynamically allocating radio spectrum based on the demands using auction is one possible approach to improve spectrum utilization efficiency. In this paper, we consider a spectrum auction game, each spectrum supplier (SS) is competing against other suppliers so as to sell as much quantity as possible to maximize its own profit. On the other hand, bandwidth bidders (BBs) are also competing against each other to get the amount of demand spectrum at a lower price. In general, understanding the supply and demand relationship decides the selling price. We propose an auction game which jointly taking in consideration the competition among SSs and BBs, where the bid for the secondary reused spectrum takes place. Given that each SS knows the bandwidth available for secondary reuse over a period of time, with the assistance of a spectrum broker, our approach uses the open bid auction theory to decide the equilibrium point. Towards the end of the bidding process, suppliers and bidders will settle at an equilibrium point, whereby the selling quantities and bidding price are obtained. Our scheme can achieve a rather stable price per bandwidth when total demands do not exceed the total supply.","doi":"10.1109/PIMRC.2009.5449802","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE 20th International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5443865/5449713/05449802.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5449713","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.2009.5449802","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE 20th International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications","startPage":"833","endPage":"837","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint demand and supply auction pricing strategy in dynamic spectrum sharing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5449802","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Sept. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Joint demand and supply auction pricing strategy in dynamic spectrum sharing","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5449802/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5449802/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"11244355","dateOfInsertion":"15 April 2010","conferenceDate":"13-16 Sept. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint demand and supply auction pricing strategy in dynamic spectrum sharing","confLoc":"Tokyo, Japan","sourcePdf":"1569227077.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.07384S","chronDate":"13-16 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5443865","isNumber":"5449713","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5443865","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"5449713","articleId":"5449802","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5449807,"authors":[{"name":"Kazuto Yano","affiliation":["Department of Wireless Communication Systems, ATR Wave Engineering Laboratories, Soraku-gun, Kyoto, Japan"],"firstName":"Kazuto","lastName":"Yano","id":"37402299800"},{"name":"Satoshi Tsukamoto","affiliation":["Department of Wireless Communication Systems, ATR Wave Engineering Laboratories, Soraku-gun, Kyoto, Japan"],"firstName":"Satoshi","lastName":"Tsukamoto","id":"37394930400"},{"name":"Makoto Taromaru","affiliation":["Department of Wireless Communication Systems, ATR Wave Engineering Laboratories, Soraku-gun, Kyoto, Japan"],"firstName":"Makoto","lastName":"Taromaru","id":"37300843900"},{"name":"Masazumi Ueba","affiliation":["Department of Wireless Communication Systems, ATR Wave Engineering Laboratories, Soraku-gun, Kyoto, Japan"],"firstName":"Masazumi","lastName":"Ueba","id":"37283437400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5122-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5123-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2166-9570"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2166-9589"}],"articleNumber":"5449807","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":139},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Adaptive arrays","Throughput","Wireless LAN","Antenna arrays","Interference suppression","Wireless application protocol","Decoding","Media Access Protocol","Receiving antennas","Physical layer"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive antenna arrays","interference suppression","least mean squares methods","OFDM modulation","wireless LAN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["area throughput enhancement","OFDM-based wireless LAN","OBSS environment","physical header modification","IEEE 802.11 wireless LAN systems","overlay transmission protocol","DATA frame transmission","MMSE adaptive array antenna","sporadic interference suppression"]}],"abstract":"To improve the area throughput of OFDM-based IEEE 802.11 wireless LAN systems in an OBSS environment, this paper proposes a new overlay transmission protocol which does not require any signal/frame exchange prior to DATA frame transmission. The proposed protocol introduces a new field which containing a portion of the BSSID to which the destination node belongs in order to indicate who must listen this frame without decoding the succeeding MAC frame. This protocol can reduce the deferring time for new frame transmission and increase the transmission chances of each node with a small overhead, whereas it causes interference toward existing communications. To suppress such interference, we employ a pre-FFT type MMSE adaptive array antenna (AAA) to suppress sporadic interference at the receiver's side. The average area throughput of a system based on IEEE 802.11g ERP-OFDM in an OBSS environment is evaluated through PHY/MAC cross-layer computer simulations assuming an AWGN channel. Simulation results shows that the area throughput improvement of about 60% can be achieved at an offered load of 24Mbytes/s by employing our proposed protocol and AAA.","doi":"10.1109/PIMRC.2009.5449807","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE 20th International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE 20th International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5443865/5449713/05449807.pdf","startPage":"3059","endPage":"3063","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.2009.5449807","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5449713","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Area throughput enhancement of OFDM-based wireless LAN in OBSS environment by physical header modification and adaptive array antenna","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5449807","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Sept. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5449807/","displayDocTitle":"Area throughput enhancement of OFDM-based wireless LAN in OBSS environment by physical header modification and adaptive array antenna","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"11244360","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5449807/","conferenceDate":"13-16 Sept. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"15 April 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Area throughput enhancement of OFDM-based wireless LAN in OBSS environment by physical header modification and adaptive array antenna","confLoc":"Tokyo, Japan","sourcePdf":"1569227118.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057407S","chronDate":"13-16 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5443865","isNumber":"5449713","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5443865","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5449713","articleId":"5449807","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5449808,"authors":[{"name":"Lin Luo","affiliation":["Institute of Telecommunications Research, University of South Australia, Mawson Lakes, SA, Australia"],"firstName":"Lin","lastName":"Luo","id":"37404188800"},{"name":"Jian Zhang","affiliation":["Canberra Research Laboratory, NICTA, Canberra, ACT, Australia"],"firstName":"Jian","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37085894378"},{"name":"Zhenning Shi","affiliation":["Alcatel Lucent Shanghai Bell Company Limited, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Zhenning","lastName":"Shi","id":"37278371900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5122-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5123-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2166-9570"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2166-9589"}],"articleNumber":"5449808","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":131},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Peak to average power ratio","OFDM","Australia","Discrete Fourier transforms","Transmitting antennas","Samarium","Frequency conversion","Interference","Lakes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["equalisers","MIMO communication","OFDM modulation","space division multiplexing","space-time codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO quadrature-OFDMA systems","peak-to-average power ratio","user terminal","carrier frequency offset problems","multiinput multioutput diversity","capacity-oriented methods","Alamouti-like spacetime block code","spatial multiplexing","ZF equalizers","MMSE equalizers"]}],"abstract":"To alleviate the high peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR), high complexity in user terminal and sensitivity to carrier frequency offset (CFO) problems in current OFDMA systems, a Quadrature OFDM (Q-OFDMA) system has been recently proposed in the single-input single-output environment.

And also timing of the GI period is detected for interference mitigation. The UWB signal is emitted during GI period to mitigate the effect of interference to the OFDM system from the UWB system. The coexisting signal detection performances are evaluated by DER (Detection Error Rate), FAR (False Alarm Rate) and also RMSE (Root Mean Square Error) of detected GI period timing. The BER (Bit Error Rate) performances of the OFDM system are also evaluated to show the availability of proposed DAA technique.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Detection and Avoidance technique for UWB radio interfering to OFDM system using Guard Interval","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE 20th International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications","doi":"10.1109/PIMRC.2009.5449818","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE 20th International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5443865/5449713/05449818.pdf","startPage":"963","endPage":"967","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.2009.5449818","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5449713","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5449818","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5449818/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Sept. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Detection and Avoidance technique for UWB radio interfering to OFDM system using Guard Interval","conferenceDate":"13-16 Sept. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5449818/","dateOfInsertion":"15 April 2010","publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"11244371","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Detection and Avoidance technique for UWB radio interfering to OFDM system using Guard Interval","confLoc":"Tokyo, Japan","sourcePdf":"1569227168.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042979S","chronDate":"13-16 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5443865","isNumber":"5449713","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5443865","xplore-issue":"5449713","articleId":"5449818","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":5449822,"authors":[{"name":"Yuyuan Chang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Tokyo Institute of Technology, Meguro, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Yuyuan","lastName":"Chang","id":"38260955200"},{"name":"Kiyomichi Araki","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Tokyo Institute of Technology, Meguro, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Kiyomichi","lastName":"Araki","id":"37270249500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5122-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5123-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2166-9570"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2166-9589"}],"articleNumber":"5449822","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":285},"abstract":"Recently, attention on wireless communications has been shifted from multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems to multiuser MIMO (MU-MIMO) systems, which serve several users simultaneously in frequency and time. For a system with multiantenna users, block diagonalization (BD) is a technique, where multiuser interference can be completely canceled. For realizing the BD algorithm, the base station should know the accurate channel state information (CSI) of users. However, the CSI fed back to the base station becomes outdated due to the time-varying nature of the channels. Channel prediction is an efficient approach to combat the performance degradation due to feedback delay in single user MIMO system, but in a BD system, the multiuser interference will still remain. In this paper, we analyse the effects of the imperfect CSI caused by feedback delay on BD MIMO downlink system with channel prediction. The result is that the interference will be proportional to the mean square error (MSE) of predicted CSI. We also propose a robust scheme for this kind of systems.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE 20th International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5443865/5449713/05449822.pdf","startPage":"3089","endPage":"3093","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE 20th International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications","doi":"10.1109/PIMRC.2009.5449822","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.2009.5449822","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5449713","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5449822","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robust design for multiuser block diagonalization MIMO downlink system with CSI feedback delay","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Robustness","MIMO","Downlink","Feedback","Delay","Base stations","Wireless communication","Frequency","Interference cancellation","Channel state information"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["delays","feedback","interference suppression","MIMO communication","time-varying channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiuser block diagonalization","CSI feedback delay","wireless communications","block diagonalization","multiantenna users","multiuser interference","channel state information","single user MIMO downlink system","mean square error"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5449822/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Sept. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Robust design for multiuser block diagonalization MIMO downlink system with CSI feedback delay","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5449822/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"11244375","dateOfInsertion":"15 April 2010","conferenceDate":"13-16 Sept. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust design for multiuser block diagonalization MIMO downlink system with CSI feedback delay","confLoc":"Tokyo, Japan","sourcePdf":"1569227257.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.091131S","chronDate":"13-16 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5443865","isNumber":"5449713","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5443865","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"5449713","articleId":"5449822","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5449823,"authors":[{"name":"Jang-Ping Sheu","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Jang-Ping","lastName":"Sheu","id":"37274527100"},{"name":"Guey-Yun Chang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, National Central University, Jhongli, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Guey-Yun","lastName":"Chang","id":"37402292000"},{"name":"Yu-Wen Chen","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, National Central University, Jhongli, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Yu-Wen","lastName":"Chen","id":"37407073300"},{"name":"Wei-Hua Chen","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, National Central University, Jhongli, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Wei-Hua","lastName":"Chen","id":"37404841700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5122-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5123-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2166-9570"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2166-9589"}],"articleNumber":"5449823","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":133},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Routing protocols","Ad hoc networks","Network topology","Vehicle driving","Costs","Road vehicles","Computer science","Computer network reliability","Telecommunication network reliability","Wireless networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ad hoc networks","mobile radio","routing protocols","telecommunication network topology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["routing protocol","vehicular ad hoc networks","communication topology","VANET","virtual landmarks based approach","packet routing"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Routing protocols","VANETs","wireless networks"]}],"abstract":"How to route packets efficiently and reliably is an important issue in Vehicular Ad hoc Networks (VANETs).

The objective is to find the jointly optimal transmitter and receiver pair of a secondary system to minimize the mean squared error (MSE) at the output of the secondary receiver, subject to zero interference induced at the output samples of the primary receiver. It is assumed that both the primary and the secondary transmitters employ linear modulation and the receivers employ linear filter front-ends. Unlike prior work, the secondary user is allowed to transmit data symbols at a fraction of the primary user's symbol rate. This rate reduction technique enables the secondary user to achieve the additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) bound or the performance close to the AWGN bound even when the excess bandwidth of the primary user is very small but positive. Numerical results show that the proposed scheme significantly improves the spectral efficiency by exploiting the cyclostationarity of the primary-user signal.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An orthogonal cognitive radio for a satellite communication link","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE 20th International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications","doi":"10.1109/PIMRC.2009.5449826","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE 20th International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5443865/5449713/05449826.pdf","startPage":"3154","endPage":"3158","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.2009.5449826","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5449713","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5449826","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5449826/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Sept. 2009","displayDocTitle":"An orthogonal cognitive radio for a satellite communication link","conferenceDate":"13-16 Sept. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5449826/","dateOfInsertion":"15 April 2010","publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"11244379","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An orthogonal cognitive radio for a satellite communication link","confLoc":"Tokyo, Japan","sourcePdf":"1569227292.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068587S","chronDate":"13-16 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5443865","isNumber":"5449713","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5443865","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"5449713","articleId":"5449826","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5449828,"authors":[{"name":"Qian Chen","affiliation":["National University of Singapore, Singapore"],"firstName":"Qian","lastName":"Chen","id":"37401937200"},{"name":"Ying-Chang Liang","affiliation":["Institute for Infocomm Research, Singapore"],"firstName":"Ying-Chang","lastName":"Liang","id":"37275171800"},{"name":"Mehul Motani","affiliation":["National University of Singapore, Singapore"],"firstName":"Mehul","lastName":"Motani","id":"37278670800"},{"name":"Wai-Choong Wong","affiliation":["National University of Singapore, Singapore"],"firstName":"Wai-Choong","lastName":"Wong","id":"37279177400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5122-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5123-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2166-9570"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2166-9589"}],"articleNumber":"5449828","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":12,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":388},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5449828","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Media Access Protocol","Access protocols","Cognitive radio","Chromium","Throughput","Centralized control","Protection","Radio spectrum management","Telecommunication traffic","Resource management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["access protocols","carrier sense multiple access","cognitive radio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["random access MAC protocol","cognitive radio networks","medium access control protocol design","spectrum access","packet delay","network metrics"]}],"doi":"10.1109/PIMRC.2009.5449828","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE 20th International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE 20th International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5443865/5449713/05449828.pdf","startPage":"486","endPage":"490","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.2009.5449828","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5449713","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"CR-CSMA: A Random Access MAC Protocol for Cognitive Radio Networks","abstract":"In this paper, we consider the medium access control (MAC) protocol design problem for random access cognitive radio networks.

For various offered traffic rates of secondary users and frame lengths, the optimal performances of secondary users can be achieved at the same spectrum sensing time, and also there exists a tradeoff between performance and agility.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Sept. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5449828/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"11244381","publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","conferenceDate":"13-16 Sept. 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5449828/","dateOfInsertion":"15 April 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"CR-CSMA: A Random Access MAC Protocol for Cognitive Radio Networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"CR-CSMA: A Random Access MAC Protocol for Cognitive Radio Networks","confLoc":"Tokyo, Japan","sourcePdf":"1569227303.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069237S","chronDate":"13-16 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5443865","isNumber":"5449713","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5443865","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"5449713","articleId":"5449828","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5449829,"authors":[{"name":"Liu Shu-hui","affiliation":["Wireless Theory & Technology Laboratory, BUPT, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Liu","lastName":"Shu-hui","id":"38272253500"},{"name":"Chang Yong-yu","affiliation":["Wireless Theory & Technology Laboratory, BUPT, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Chang","lastName":"Yong-yu","id":"38276060700"},{"name":"Yang Yang","affiliation":["Wireless Theory & Technology Laboratory, BUPT, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yang","lastName":"Yang","id":"38277818400"},{"name":"Wang Yan-long","affiliation":["Wireless Theory & Technology Laboratory, BUPT, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Wang","lastName":"Yan-long","id":"38270670200"},{"name":"Yang Da-cheng","affiliation":["Wireless Theory & Technology Laboratory, BUPT, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yang","lastName":"Da-cheng","id":"38270090900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5122-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5123-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2166-9570"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2166-9589"}],"articleNumber":"5449829","dbTime":"14 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":114},"abstract":"In this paper, a novel effective low-complexity single carrier frequency-domain equalization SC-FDE scheme in multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system is introduced under frequency selective channel.

We demonstrate the macro offload capability of HNBs and show that end-user experience in many cases is mainly improved due to being the only one served by the cell. We find that 25% of users would experience worse channel quality towards their HNB than towards the MNB in the same location, though the overall network capacity is improved.

The ECOS scheme consists of a quality-of-service (QoS) guarantee scheduling (QGS) algorithm and a CSI overhead reduction (COR) algorithm. The QGS algorithm guarantees QoS requirements by adjusting priority value and anticipated rate of users dynamically. In addition, it achieves balance between QoS guarantee and throughput maximization by employing a priority threshold. The COR algorithm performs admissible user selection to economize the amount of CSI overhead. Since all users do not need to feed back CSI every frame, the transmission power used for CSI reporting is economized. Besides, the COR algorithm can reduce the computation complexity of the QGS algorithm because the number of users to be scheduled is reduced. Simulation results show that the proposed ECOS scheme greatly reduces the uplink bandwidth occupancy of CSI feedback. Also, it achieves high system throughput and maintains QoS guarantee at high traffic load.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE 20th International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5443865/5449713/05449834.pdf","startPage":"1391","endPage":"1395","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE 20th International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications","doi":"10.1109/PIMRC.2009.5449834","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.2009.5449834","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5449713","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5449834","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Opportunistic scheduling with economized CSI feedback for OFDMA/TDD downlink systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Feedback","Downlink","Scheduling algorithm","Throughput","Channel state information","Quality of service","Feeds","Processor scheduling","Computational modeling","Bandwidth"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feedback","frequency division multiple access","OFDM modulation","quality of service","scheduling","time division multiplexing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["opportunistic scheduling","economized CSI feedback","OFDMA-TDD downlink systems","quality-of-service guarantee scheduling algorithm","CSI overhead reduction algorithm","admissible user selection","computation complexity","QoS guarantee"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5449834/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Sept. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Opportunistic scheduling with economized CSI feedback for OFDMA/TDD downlink systems","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5449834/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"11244387","dateOfInsertion":"15 April 2010","conferenceDate":"13-16 Sept. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Opportunistic scheduling with economized CSI feedback for OFDMA/TDD downlink systems","confLoc":"Tokyo, Japan","sourcePdf":"1569227330.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045566S","chronDate":"13-16 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5443865","isNumber":"5449713","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5443865","xplore-issue":"5449713","articleId":"5449834","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5449836,"authors":[{"name":"Lei Jiao","affiliation":["Department of Information and Communication Technology, University of Agder, Grimstad, Norway"],"firstName":"Lei","lastName":"Jiao","id":"37401908300"},{"name":"Frank Y.

The second one is based on the concept of connected dominating set in which a backbone is formed in the network in order to keep the continuity of the communication.

Line-of-Sight (LOS) link is easily blocked by a moving person, which is concerned as one of the severe problems in 60 GHz systems. Beamforming is a feasible technique to resolve link blockage by switching the beam path from LOS link to a Non-LOS (NLOS) link. We propose and evaluate two kinds of Beam Switching (BS) mechanisms: instant decision based BS and environment learning based BS. We examine these mechanisms in a typical indoor WPAN scenario. Extensive simulations have been carried out, and our results reveal that combining angle-of-arrival with the received signal to noise ratio could make better decision for beam switching. Our work provides valuable observations for beam switching during point-to-point communication using 60 GHz radio.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Beam switching support to resolve link-blockage problem in 60 GHz WPANs","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE 20th International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications","doi":"10.1109/PIMRC.2009.5449837","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE 20th International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5443865/5449713/05449837.pdf","startPage":"390","endPage":"394","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.2009.5449837","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5449713","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5449837","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5449837/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Sept. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Beam switching support to resolve link-blockage problem in 60 GHz WPANs","conferenceDate":"13-16 Sept. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5449837/","dateOfInsertion":"15 April 2010","publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"11244390","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Beam switching support to resolve link-blockage problem in 60 GHz WPANs","confLoc":"Tokyo, Japan","sourcePdf":"1569227350.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049554S","chronDate":"13-16 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5443865","isNumber":"5449713","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5443865","citationCount":"51","xplore-issue":"5449713","articleId":"5449837","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5449840,"authors":[{"name":"Musbah Shaat","affiliation":["Centre Tecnol\u00f2gic de Telecomunicacions de Catalunya, Barcelona, Spain"],"firstName":"Musbah","lastName":"Shaat","id":"37392258400"},{"name":"Faouzi Bader","affiliation":["Centre Tecnol\u00f2gic de Telecomunicacions de Catalunya, Barcelona, Spain"],"firstName":"Faouzi","lastName":"Bader","id":"37282298800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5122-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5123-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2166-9570"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2166-9589"}],"articleNumber":"5449840","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":14,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":284},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cognitive radio","Chromium","OFDM","Resource management","Computational complexity","Wireless communication","Filter bank","Downlink","Interference constraints","Computational modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","computational complexity","resource allocation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["low-complexity power loading scheme","cognitive radio networks","FBMC capability","spectrum scarcity","spectrum efficiency problem","multicarrier communications","filter bank multicarrier","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","OFDM","resource allocation","multicarrier-based CR networks","downlink capacity mazimisation","computational complexity","low-complexity suboptimal solution"]}],"abstract":"Quick development of wireless communication makes the spectrum scarcity as a one of the serious problems. Cognitive radio (CR) is considered to be one of the possible solutions to solve the spectrum efficiency problem. Multicarrier communications are considered to be used in CR networks. Due to its high spectral efficiency, filter bank multicarrier (FBMC) can be considered as an alternative to conventional orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) for transmission over the CR networks. This paper addresses the problem of resource allocation in multicarrier based CR networks. The objective is to maximize the downlink capacity of the network under both total power and interference introduced to the primary users (PU's) constraints. The optimal solution has high computational complexity which makes it unsuitable for practical applications and hence a low complexity suboptimal solution is proposed. The performance of using FBMC instead of OFDM in CR systems is investigated. Simulation results illustrate that the proposed resource allocation algorithm with low computational complexity achieves near optimal performance and prove the efficiency of using FBMC in CR context.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Low complexity power loading scheme in cognitive radio networks: FBMC capability","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE 20th International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications","doi":"10.1109/PIMRC.2009.5449840","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE 20th International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5443865/5449713/05449840.pdf","startPage":"2597","endPage":"2602","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.2009.5449840","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5449713","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5449840","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5449840/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Sept. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Low complexity power loading scheme in cognitive radio networks: FBMC capability","conferenceDate":"13-16 Sept. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5449840/","dateOfInsertion":"15 April 2010","publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"11244393","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low complexity power loading scheme in cognitive radio networks: FBMC capability","confLoc":"Tokyo, Japan","sourcePdf":"1569227362.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.039605S","chronDate":"13-16 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5443865","isNumber":"5449713","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5443865","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"5449713","articleId":"5449840","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5449843,"authors":[{"name":"Yong Bai","affiliation":["Docomo Beijing Communication Laboratories Company Limited, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yong","lastName":"Bai","id":"37289894700"},{"name":"Juejia Zhou","affiliation":["Docomo Beijing Communication Laboratories Company Limited, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Juejia","lastName":"Zhou","id":"37404018900"},{"name":"Liu Liu","affiliation":["Docomo Beijing Communication Laboratories Company Limited, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Liu","lastName":"Liu","id":"37406781500"},{"name":"Lan Chen","affiliation":["Docomo Beijing Communication Laboratories Company Limited, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Lan","lastName":"Chen","id":"37292795300"},{"name":"Hiroyuki Otsuka","affiliation":["Docomo Beijing Communication Laboratories Company Limited, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Hiroyuki","lastName":"Otsuka","id":"37396597400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5122-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5123-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2166-9570"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2166-9589"}],"articleNumber":"5449843","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":18,"citationCountPatent":3,"totalDownloads":472},"abstract":"This paper investigates spectrum resource coordination for the mixed macrocell and femtocell deployment.

Femtocells are conceived to provide indoor wireless access to a cellular network through a Home Base Station, which is connected via internet to the operator's core network, helping to improve coverage in indoors, offload the macrocell and reduce costs for operators. However, large scale deployment of femtocells can severely interfere with the existing macrocell within which they are deployed, particularly when operating in co-channel or in immediate adjacent channels with respect to the macrocell and when using a closed access policy. For instance, macrocell coverage holes in the downlink will appear, i.e. zones in the vicinity of a home base station where interference from home base station signals will prevent macrocell users to receive the desired service from the macrocell network. In this paper, we estimate macrocell coverage holes produced by closed access femtocells when both, macro and femto networks operate FDD WCDMA-based technologies. We investigate the case when the home base station transmits at constant power and when uses a power adjustment mechanism, and for different values of separation in the frequency domain. Results show that coverage holes at the edge of the macrocell can have a radius up to 30 meters when the same carrier is used and up to 5 m when carriers separated 5 MHz are used. Finally, we analyze and discuss how coverage and spectrum allocation are influenced by varying the carrier separation.","doi":"10.1109/PIMRC.2009.5449849","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE 20th International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE 20th International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5443865/5449713/05449849.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.2009.5449849","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5449713","startPage":"2208","endPage":"2212","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis of macro \u2014 femtocell interference and implications for spectrum allocation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5449849","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Analysis of macro \u2014 femtocell interference and implications for spectrum allocation","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Sept. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5449849/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"13-16 Sept. 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"11244402","dateOfInsertion":"15 April 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5449849/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis of macro \u2014 femtocell interference and implications for spectrum allocation","confLoc":"Tokyo, Japan","sourcePdf":"1569227390.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057686S","chronDate":"13-16 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5443865","isNumber":"5449713","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5443865","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"5449713","articleId":"5449849","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5449855,"authors":[{"name":"Jean-Baptiste Landre","affiliation":["Orange Laboratories, Issy-les-Moulineaux, France"],"firstName":"Jean-Baptiste","lastName":"Landre","id":"37391883000"},{"name":"Ahmed Saadani","affiliation":["Orange Laboratories, Issy-les-Moulineaux, France"],"firstName":"Ahmed","lastName":"Saadani","id":"37268236000"},{"name":"Fran\u00e7ois Ortolan","affiliation":["Orange Laboratories, Issy-les-Moulineaux, France"],"firstName":"Fran\u00e7ois","lastName":"Ortolan","id":"37392254300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5122-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5123-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2166-9570"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2166-9589"}],"articleNumber":"5449855","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":151},"abstract":"This paper studies realistic throughput performance of HSDPA+ multi-antenna system on a macro-cell network. A major evolution of HSDPA is the introduction of the multi-antenna scheme D-TxAA (Double Transmit Adaptative Array) in 3GPP standard release 7 and 8, allowing to increase HSDPA peak rate up to 42 Mbps using MIMO/FDD transmission. A simulation method has been developed to combine drive test measurement and link level simulation of different linear receiver to obtain reliable performance estimation. The simulation results shows that the MIMO scheme with linear equalizer gives a significant improvement at the cell edge. However, non linear receivers are needed in the cell center.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE 20th International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio

uplink resource is reused by the D2D transmission. In order to maximize the overall system performance, the mutual interference between cellular and D2D sub-systems has to be addressed. Here, two mechanisms are proposed to solve the problem: One is mitigating the interference from cellular transmission to D2D communication by an interference tracing approach. The other one is aiming to reduce the interference from D2D transmission to cellular communication by a tolerable interference broadcasting approach. Both mechanisms can work independently or jointly to synergy the transmission in the hybrid system for the efficient resource utilization. In the end, simulation is conducted to study the performance of the proposed schemes, which shows satisfying results.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5449856/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Sept. 2009","publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"13-16 Sept. 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5449856/","dateOfInsertion":"15 April 2010","accessionNumber":"11244409","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Interference avoidance mechanisms in the hybrid cellular and device-to-device systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Interference avoidance mechanisms in the hybrid cellular and device-to-device systems","confLoc":"Tokyo, Japan","sourcePdf":"1569227412.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.035973S","chronDate":"13-16 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5443865","isNumber":"5449713","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5443865","citationCount":"143","xplore-issue":"5449713","articleId":"5449856","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5449857,"authors":[{"name":"Yang Liu","affiliation":["ENST, Paris, France"],"firstName":"Yang","lastName":"Liu","id":"37405162200"},{"name":"Lo\u00efc Brunel","affiliation":["Mitsubishi Electric ITE-TCL, Rennes, France"],"firstName":"Lo\u00efc","lastName":"Brunel","id":"37283177900"},{"name":"Joseph J.

We propose to replace these densities by standard messages where the channel estimate is accurately modeled as a Gaussian mixture over multipath channel. Upward messages include symbol extrinsic information and downward messages carry mean values and variances for the Gaussian modeled channel estimate. Such unquantized message propagation leads to a complexity reduction and a performance improvement. Over multipath channel, the proposed belief propagation almost achieves the performance of iterative APP equalizer and outperforms MMSE equalizer.","doi":"10.1109/PIMRC.2009.5449857","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE 20th International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE 20th International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5443865/5449713/05449857.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.2009.5449857","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5449713","startPage":"3164","endPage":"3168","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint channel estimation and decoding using Gaussian approximation in a factor graph over multipath channel","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5449857","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Joint channel estimation and decoding using Gaussian approximation in a factor graph over multipath channel","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Sept. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5449857/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"13-16 Sept. 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"11244410","dateOfInsertion":"15 April 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5449857/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint channel estimation and decoding using Gaussian approximation in a factor graph over multipath channel","confLoc":"Tokyo, Japan","sourcePdf":"1569227413.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04363S","chronDate":"13-16 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5443865","isNumber":"5449713","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5443865","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"5449713","articleId":"5449857","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5449858,"authors":[{"name":"Zhengguo Sheng","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Imperial College London, UK"],"firstName":"Zhengguo","lastName":"Sheng","id":"37394338000"},{"name":"D.

In particular, our analysis shows that the relay gain is a central parameter in the mitigation of residual loop interference and for the optimization of the end-to-end performance.","doi":"10.1109/PIMRC.2009.5449862","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE 20th International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE 20th International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5443865/5449713/05449862.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.2009.5449862","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5449713","startPage":"3169","endPage":"3173","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"SINR analysis of full-duplex OFDM repeaters","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5449862","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"SINR analysis of full-duplex OFDM repeaters","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Sept. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5449862/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"13-16 Sept. 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"11244415","dateOfInsertion":"15 April 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5449862/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"SINR analysis of full-duplex OFDM repeaters","confLoc":"Tokyo, Japan","sourcePdf":"1569227429.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066152S","chronDate":"13-16 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5443865","isNumber":"5449713","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5443865","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"5449713","articleId":"5449862","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5449864,"authors":[{"name":"Dieter Van Welden","affiliation":["TELIN Department, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium"],"firstName":"Dieter","lastName":"Van Welden","id":"37296847600"},{"name":"Heidi Steendam","affiliation":["TELIN Department, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium"],"firstName":"Heidi","lastName":"Steendam","id":"37269092200"},{"name":"Marc Moeneclaey","affiliation":["TELIN Department, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium"],"firstName":"Marc","lastName":"Moeneclaey","id":"37269902700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5122-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5123-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2166-9570"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2166-9589"}],"articleNumber":"5449864","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":106},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Delay effects","Delay estimation","Fading","OFDM","Frequency synchronization","Bit error rate","Frequency estimation","Maximum likelihood estimation","Interference","Time domain analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["delay estimation","error statistics","fading channels","multipath channels","OFDM modulation","synchronisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["time delay estimation","KSP-OFDM systems","multipath fading channels","known symbol padding orthogonal frequency division multiplexing systems","frequency selectivity","bit error rate"]}],"abstract":"In this paper we present a time delay estimation algorithm for known symbol padding (KSP) orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems.

Due to the increasing scarcity and cost of spectrum, partial spectrum reuse by secondary networks is being considered to improve spectral efficiency. Additionally, new revenue streams can be extracted from existing resources by utilising partial spectrum reuse. The partial reuse of spectrum depends largely on the ability of the secondary network to mitigate the negative interference impact upon the primary network. This can be achieved by the establishment of acceptable interference criteria. This paper presents a solution to the problem of meeting the interference criteria with regards to frequency allocation and power configuration within the femtocell network. We demonstrate that these solutions can be applied successfully to allow for partial spectrum reuse in the GSM band. Furthermore we present an analysis of both the theoretical performance of femtocells and the resulting impact on the macrocellular network.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Partial GSM spectrum reuse for femtocells","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE 20th International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications","doi":"10.1109/PIMRC.2009.5449865","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE 20th International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5443865/5449713/05449865.pdf","startPage":"2111","endPage":"2116","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.2009.5449865","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5449713","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5449865","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5449865/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Sept. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Partial GSM spectrum reuse for femtocells","conferenceDate":"13-16 Sept. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5449865/","dateOfInsertion":"15 April 2010","publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"11244418","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Partial GSM spectrum reuse for femtocells","confLoc":"Tokyo, Japan","sourcePdf":"1569227452.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071127S","chronDate":"13-16 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5443865","isNumber":"5449713","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5443865","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"5449713","articleId":"5449865","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5449866,"authors":[{"name":"Xitao Gong","affiliation":["Institute of Integrated Signal Processing Systems, RWTH Aachen University, Germany"],"firstName":"Xitao","lastName":"Gong","id":"37407033800"},{"name":"Markus Jordan","affiliation":["Institute of Integrated Signal Processing Systems, RWTH Aachen University, Germany"],"firstName":"Markus","lastName":"Jordan","id":"37395352500"},{"name":"Guido Dartmann","affiliation":["Institute of Integrated Signal Processing Systems, RWTH Aachen University, Germany"],"firstName":"Guido","lastName":"Dartmann","id":"37391629400"},{"name":"Gerd Ascheid","affiliation":["Institute of Integrated Signal Processing Systems, RWTH Aachen University, Germany"],"firstName":"Gerd","lastName":"Ascheid","id":"37268217800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5122-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5123-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2166-9570"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2166-9589"}],"articleNumber":"5449866","dbTime":"14 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":10,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":340},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Array signal processing","Downlink","Statistics","Iterative algorithms","Signal to noise ratio","Base stations","Lagrangian functions","Interference","Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","Computational modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","duality (mathematics)","eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","iterative methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["max-min beamforming","multicell downlink systems","long-term channel statistics","multiple base stations","transmit beamforming vectors","Lagrangian duality","dual uplink problem","signal to interference plus noise ratio","generalized eigenvalue decomposition","dominant eigenvector","dual uplink transmit power","duality theory","iterative algorithm"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5449866","doi":"10.1109/PIMRC.2009.5449866","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE 20th International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications","abstract":"This paper investigates max-min beamforming for the multicell downlink transmission, where multiple base stations (BSs) cooperatively optimize their transmit beamforming vectors using long-term channel statistics.

An important issue addressed here is the generation of soft information from the binary outputs of the bit-flipping decoder to be fed back to the MIMO detector. Simulation results show that the proposed joint detection and decoding algorithm achieves a substantial reduction in decoding error probability compared to a cascaded detector and a decoder. We also compare the performance with belief-propagation (BP) based detector-decoders which are significantly more complex.

A key element of the proposed designs is the way the M-algorithm chooses its survivor candidates during the tree search. In particular, at every depth in the tree the survivor list comprises the best M candidates as well as additional good candidates which are chosen to enable high-quality soft-output information for every bit.

The proposed TSTD system employs the ARQ scheme in which the receiver sends the acknowledgement signal (ACK or NACK) to the transmitter in order to predict the condition of the channel. For the ARQ-aided TSTD system, the proposed antenna switching pattern triggers the transmit antenna switches. Simulation results demonstrate that the performances of the TSTD systems can be improved by applying the ARQ scheme. Furthermore, the performances of ARQ-aided TSTD systems may be significantly improved by applying the proposed antenna switching scheme, especially when the mobile speed is low.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE 20th International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5443865/5449713/05449879.pdf","startPage":"2395","endPage":"2398","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE 20th International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications","doi":"10.1109/PIMRC.2009.5449879","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.2009.5449879","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5449713","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5449879","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Antenna switching scheme for downlink time switched transmit diversity with ARQ in the WCDMA LCR-TDD system","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Transmitting antennas","Downlink","Automatic repeat request","Multiaccess communication","Diversity methods","Data communication","Switches","3G mobile communication","Communication switching","Antenna feeds"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antennas","automatic repeat request","code division multiple access","diversity reception","telecommunication switching"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna switching scheme","downlink time switched transmit diversity","WCDMA LCR-TDD system","ARQ scheme","acknowledgement signal","transmit antenna switches"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Time Switched Transmit Diversity","Automatic Repeat reQuest","Transmit Diversity","Antenna switching"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5449879/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Sept. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Antenna switching scheme for downlink time switched transmit diversity with ARQ in the WCDMA LCR-TDD system","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5449879/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"11244432","dateOfInsertion":"15 April 2010","conferenceDate":"13-16 Sept. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Antenna switching scheme for downlink time switched transmit diversity with ARQ in the WCDMA LCR-TDD system","confLoc":"Tokyo, Japan","sourcePdf":"1569227560.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.037164S","chronDate":"13-16 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5443865","isNumber":"5449713","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5443865","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5449713","articleId":"5449879","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5449882,"authors":[{"name":"Rami Abu-alhiga","affiliation":["Institute of Digital Communications, Joint Research Institute of Signal and Image Processing, School of Engineering, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, UK"],"firstName":"Rami","lastName":"Abu-alhiga","id":"38272969400"},{"name":"Harald Haas","affiliation":["Institute of Digital Communications, Joint Research Institute of Signal and Image Processing, School of Engineering, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, UK"],"firstName":"Harald","lastName":"Haas","id":"37269894900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5122-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5123-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2166-9570"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2166-9589"}],"articleNumber":"5449882","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":207,"citationCountPatent":3,"totalDownloads":4488},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5449882","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM modulation","Amplitude shift keying","Quadrature amplitude modulation","Two dimensional displays","Phase modulation","Error analysis","Bit error rate","Rayleigh channels","Performance analysis","Analytical models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["error statistics","OFDM modulation","phase modulation","quadrature amplitude modulation","Rayleigh channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["OFDM subcarrier-index modulation","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing systems","two-dimensional amplitude-phase modulation techniques","amplitude shift keying","quadrature amplitude modulation","closed-form analytical bit error ratio","Rayleigh channel","error probability performance gain"]}],"abstract":"A new transmission approach, referred to as subcarrier-index modulation (SIM) is proposed to be integrated with the orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems.

The key idea of SIM is to employ the subcarrier-index to convey information to the receiver. Furthermore, a closed-form analytical bit error ratio (BER) of SIM OFDM in Rayleigh channel is derived. Analytical and simulation results show error probability performance gain of 4 dB over 4-QAM OFDM systems for both coded and uncoded data without power saving policy. Alternatively, power saving policy retains an average gain of 1 dB while using 3 dB less transmit power per OFDM symbol.","doi":"10.1109/PIMRC.2009.5449882","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5449713","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.2009.5449882","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE 20th International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE 20th International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5443865/5449713/05449882.pdf","startPage":"177","endPage":"181","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Subcarrier-index modulation OFDM","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"13-16 Sept. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Subcarrier-index modulation OFDM","isConference":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Sept. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"15 April 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5449882/","publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"11244460","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5449882/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Subcarrier-index modulation OFDM","confLoc":"Tokyo, Japan","sourcePdf":"1569227586.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067827S","chronDate":"13-16 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5443865","isNumber":"5449713","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5443865","citationCount":"207","xplore-issue":"5449713","articleId":"5449882","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5449883,"authors":[{"name":"C.

The focus lies on channels with a strong and unobstructed line-of-sight (LOS) signal component between transmitter (Tx) and receiver (Rx), as it is the case in indoor in-room scenarios. The bandwidth efficiency of the resulting correlated P2P MIMO channel is strongly dependent upon the geometrical antenna setup. Especially the angle of arrival (AOA) and the inter-array antenna spacing of uniform linear arrays (ULAs) influence the bandwidth efficiency. Both influences are minimized by the use of distributed simple amplify-and-forward relay stations, while the resulting relay MIMO channel is correlated. In the relay case, the total transmit power spent at the Tx and the relay is limited to the transmit power of the Tx in the P2P case for a fair comparison. Relay stations are capable to enhance the bandwidth efficiency of the pure LOS MIMO channels, while the high bandwidth efficiency of channels with LOS and non line-of-sight (NLOS) signal components is not further increased in the considered scenario.","doi":"10.1109/PIMRC.2009.5449883","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE 20th International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE 20th International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5443865/5449713/05449883.pdf","startPage":"2325","endPage":"2329","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.2009.5449883","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5449713","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Amplify-and-forward relay stations in correlated line-of-sight indoor MIMO channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5449883","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Sept. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5449883/","displayDocTitle":"Amplify-and-forward relay stations in correlated line-of-sight indoor MIMO channels","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"11244461","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5449883/","conferenceDate":"13-16 Sept. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"15 April 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Amplify-and-forward relay stations in correlated line-of-sight indoor MIMO channels","confLoc":"Tokyo, Japan","sourcePdf":"1569227598.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057812S","chronDate":"13-16 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5443865","isNumber":"5449713","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5443865","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5449713","articleId":"5449883","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5449884,"authors":[{"name":"Chao Feng","affiliation":["Wireless Theories and Technologies Laboratory (WT&T, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Chao","lastName":"Feng","id":"37400682800"},{"name":"Lei Cao","affiliation":["Wireless Theories and Technologies Laboratory (WT&T, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Lei","lastName":"Cao","id":"37407515500"},{"name":"Xin Zhang","affiliation":["Wireless Theories and Technologies Laboratory (WT&T, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Xin","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37291970600"},{"name":"Dacheng Yang","affiliation":["Wireless Theories and Technologies Laboratory (WT&T, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Dacheng","lastName":"Yang","id":"37281508500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5122-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5123-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2166-9570"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2166-9589"}],"articleNumber":"5449884","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":97},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Transmitting antennas","MIMO","Relays","Performance loss","Antenna theory","Array signal processing","Slot antennas","Propagation losses","Performance analysis","Signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","communication complexity","MIMO communication","Monte Carlo methods","transmitting antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["diversity order analysis","suboptimal transmit antenna selection strategy","nonregenerative half-duplex MIMO relay channel","beamforming","complexity reduction","SNR estimation","transmit antennas","Monte Carlo simulation","outage probability"]}],"abstract":"This paper proposes a novel sub-optimal transmit antenna selection (TAS) strategy for non-regenerative half-duplex MIMO relay channel.

However, the intra-cell interference (ISI and ICI) may be severe, when GI becomes insufficient in an execrable radio environment. Under fractional load (FL), resource allocator doesn't have to occupy entire system bandwidth due to the lack of traffic in the network, that is, the flexibility of allocator is increased for resource management. Instead of the complicated interference reduction algorithms at the receiver, in this paper we proposed a novel adaptive resource allocation (ARA) scheme, which utilizes the flexibility of radio resource management under FL, to efficiently avoid intra-cell interference in insufficient GI scenario. System-level simulations show that, the proposed ARA improves system performance than the conventional resource allocation (CRA) under FL, whereas the performance of proposed ARA approaches the CRA under the full load.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE 20th International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio

intentionally violated to improve the spectral efficiency at the expense of system complexity. This paper investigates reliable polynomial-time hard detection techniques for SEFDM systems, by relaxing the optimal combinatorial Maximum Likelihood (ML) detection to a Semidefinite Program (SDP). SDP can be solved in almost cubic complexity over the number of the SEFDM subcarriers, N. However, the relaxation results into a degradation of the system error performance. In particular, we study the effect of the number of SEFDM subcarriers, N, and the subcarrier separation, \u00bff, on the SDP relaxation gap in the presence of Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN). We find that as N increases and/or \u00bff decreases, the SDP estimate gradually diverges from the optimal solution. To overcome this problem, we propose the use of a boxed ML procedure around the SDP estimate. We show by simulation that the SDP-ML combination approximates the optimum detection for N \u00bf 32 subcarriers and up to 20% of bandwidth reduction with respect to an equivalent Orthogonal FDM (OFDM). Our SDP results show a small error penalty when compared to optimal Sphere Decoders (SD), whose computational effort is random and noise dependant, and thereby indicate that our proposed technique is useable in practical SEFDM systems with a moderate number of subcarriers.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5449891/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Sept. 2009","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"13-16 Sept. 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5449891/","dateOfInsertion":"15 April 2010","publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"11244469","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Investigation of a Semidefinite Programming detection for a spectrally efficient FDM system","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Investigation of a Semidefinite Programming detection for a spectrally efficient FDM system","confLoc":"Tokyo, Japan","sourcePdf":"1569227659.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073072S","chronDate":"13-16 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5443865","isNumber":"5449713","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5443865","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"5449713","articleId":"5449891","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":5449892,"authors":[{"name":"Sotiris Karachontzitis","affiliation":["Wireless Telecommunications Laboratory, Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Patras, Rio, Greece"],"firstName":"Sotiris","lastName":"Karachontzitis","id":"37392252600"},{"name":"Dimitris Toumpakaris","affiliation":["Wireless Telecommunications Laboratory, Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Patras, Rio, Greece"],"firstName":"Dimitris","lastName":"Toumpakaris","id":"37269374100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5122-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5123-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2166-9570"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2166-9589"}],"articleNumber":"5449892","dbTime":"47 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":15,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":253},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Downlink","MIMO","Multiaccess communication","Array signal processing","Resource management","Receiving antennas","Laboratories","Algorithm design and analysis","Helium","System performance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["linear codes","MIMO communication","precoding","radio links","space division multiple access","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["low-complexity user selection","multiuser MISO downlink wireless channel","zero-forcing linear precoding","low-complexity correlation-based space division multiple access","SDMA"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["MISO","SDMA","Zero-Forcing Beamforming","Multiuser Diversity"]}],"abstract":"In this work an efficient low-complexity user selection algorithm for the multiuser MISO downlink wireless channel is presented.

Monte Carlo simulation shows that the optimum LDCs with or without this orthogonal structure have nearly identical bit-error rate (BER) performances, but the complexity can be significantly reduced. For a 2\u00d74 MIMO system transmitting 8 QPSK symbols in a block length of 4, the reduction is about 28-52%, and for a 3\u00d73 MIMO system transmitting 10 QPSK symbols in a block length of 6, the reduction is about 28-49%.","doi":"10.1109/PIMRC.2009.5449896","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE 20th International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5443865/5449713/05449896.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5449713","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.2009.5449896","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE 20th International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications","startPage":"1762","endPage":"1765","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Linear dispersion code with an orthogonal row structure for simplifying sphere decoding","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5449896","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Sept. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Linear dispersion code with an orthogonal row structure for simplifying sphere decoding","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5449896/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5449896/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"11244474","dateOfInsertion":"15 April 2010","conferenceDate":"13-16 Sept. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Linear dispersion code with an orthogonal row structure for simplifying sphere decoding","confLoc":"Tokyo, Japan","sourcePdf":"1569227692.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06207S","chronDate":"13-16 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5443865","isNumber":"5449713","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5443865","xplore-issue":"5449713","articleId":"5449896","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5449897,"authors":[{"name":"Jun Jing","affiliation":["Institute of Communications Engineering, People''s Liberation Army University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Jun","lastName":"Jing","id":"37411300300"},{"name":"Youyun Xu","affiliation":["Institute of Communications Engineering, People''s Liberation Army University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Youyun","lastName":"Xu","id":"37277724400"},{"name":"Yueming Cai","affiliation":["Institute of Communications Engineering, People''s Liberation Army University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Yueming","lastName":"Cai","id":"37290653400"},{"name":"Weiwei Yang","affiliation":["Institute of Communications Engineering, People''s Liberation Army University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Weiwei","lastName":"Yang","id":"37290575300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5122-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5123-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2166-9570"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2166-9589"}],"articleNumber":"5449897","dbTime":"17 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":71},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Channel estimation","Bit error rate","System performance","Data mining","Information analysis","Performance analysis","Computational modeling","Analytical models","Degradation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","error statistics","OFDM modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["superimposed training sequence","OFDM systems","channel estimation","channel identification condition","channel length","BER performance degradation","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","bit error rate"]}],"abstract":"It is conventionally supposed that the periodicity of superimposed training (ST) sequence designed for channel estimation has no impact on the ST system's performance, as long as the channel identification condition is satisfied. Accordingly the shortest sequence period equal to channel length is always preferred in ST-OFDM systems for its computational tractability. However, with additional consideration on extraction of the transmitted information, not only focusing on the accuracy of channel estimation, analysis and simulation indicate that the period length of ST sequence may have an unignorable influence on BER performance of ST-OFDM systems. As a special case, we show that ST with training sequence period equal to channel length can bring OFDM no benefit but BER performance degradation compared with its frequency-divided pilot counterpart.","doi":"10.1109/PIMRC.2009.5449897","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE 20th International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE 20th International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5443865/5449713/05449897.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.2009.5449897","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5449713","startPage":"3179","endPage":"3182","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the periodicity of superimposed training sequence for OFDM systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5449897","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"On the periodicity of superimposed training sequence for OFDM systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Sept. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5449897/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"13-16 Sept. 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"11244475","dateOfInsertion":"15 April 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5449897/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the periodicity of superimposed training sequence for OFDM systems","confLoc":"Tokyo, Japan","sourcePdf":"1569227695.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.0423S","chronDate":"13-16 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5443865","isNumber":"5449713","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5443865","xplore-issue":"5449713","articleId":"5449897","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5449901,"authors":[{"name":"Narges Noori","affiliation":["Iran Telecommunication Research Center, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Narges","lastName":"Noori","id":"37302937300"},{"name":"S.

In this paper, we consider a primary broadcasting network consisting of a transmitter and a number of primary users (PUs). The secondary users (SUs) make opportunistic unlicensed spectrum access to communicate with their base station (BS). With this system model, a joint power allocation and beamforming scheme is proposed in the uplink of the CR network to minimize the maximum interference to the PUs in two different scenarios. In the first scenario, the primary transmitter does not cooperate with the CR network and it transmits with a fixed power, whereas it cooperates in the joint power allocation and beamforming scheme and adjusts its transmission power accordingly, in the second scenario. In the former case, our proposed joint power allocation and beamforming scheme finds the beamforming weights and transmission power values under quality of service (QoS) constraints of all SUs, taking into account their maximum transmission power constraints. In the latter case, the proposed scheme finds the beamforming weights of the BS and transmission powers of primary transmitter and SUs under their target signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratios (SINRs) and maximum power constraints. Our approach employs Genetic Algorithm (GA) to determine optimum transmission power values and beamforming weight vectors. Simulation results show the performance of the proposed scheme.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5449901/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Sept. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"15 April 2010","accessionNumber":"11244479","htmlLink":"/document/5449901/","conferenceDate":"13-16 Sept. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Limiting harmful interference to the primary users through joint power allocation and beamforming in the uplink of cognitive radio networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Limiting harmful interference to the primary users through joint power allocation and beamforming in the uplink of cognitive radio networks","confLoc":"Tokyo, Japan","sourcePdf":"1569227740.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051732S","chronDate":"13-16 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5443865","isNumber":"5449713","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5443865","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"5449713","articleId":"5449901","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5449903,"authors":[{"name":"Li Zeng","affiliation":["Wireless Theories and Technologies Laboratory (WT&T), Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Li","lastName":"Zeng","id":"37398385000"},{"name":"Jing Jin","affiliation":["Wireless Theories and Technologies Laboratory (WT&T), Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Jing","lastName":"Jin","id":"37293177600"},{"name":"Yafeng Wang","affiliation":["Wireless Theories and Technologies Laboratory (WT&T), Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yafeng","lastName":"Wang","id":"37407536800"},{"name":"Dacheng Yang","affiliation":["Wireless Theories and Technologies Laboratory (WT&T), Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Dacheng","lastName":"Yang","id":"37281508500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5122-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5123-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2166-9570"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2166-9589"}],"articleNumber":"5449903","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":591},"abstract":"To further improve and satisfy the spectral efficiency requirements addressed in LTE-Advanced system, in this paper, a Coordinated Multi-Cell MU-MIMO scheme is proposed to achieve this goal, especially to enhance the cell-edge user(the 5% of user throughput) throughput substantially. In our proposed cooperative scheme, we adopt multi-cell block diagonalization (BD) algorithm to perform joint procession across the evolved coordinated eNodeBs to mitigate the inter-cell interference (ICI) so as to enhance the whole system performance. Proportional fair (PF) scheduling algorithm is also applied to guarantee the fairness between the users. Furthermore, different numbers of antennas employed at the eNodeB are considered and their affects on our proposed cooperative scheme are analyzed as well. Of course, a system simulation platform is established for the downlink LTE-Advanced system to evaluate the performance of this scheme from the system level perspective. Ultimately, from the simulation results, we can draw that the coordinated multi-cell MU-MIMO scheme we proposed is an effective approach to improve the spectral efficiency prominently and much more spectral efficient comparing to conventional non-cooperative MIMO scheme for the downlink LTE-Advanced system.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE 20th International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5443865/5449713/05449903.pdf","startPage":"2117","endPage":"2121","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE 20th International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications","doi":"10.1109/PIMRC.2009.5449903","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.2009.5449903","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5449713","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5449903","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A coordinated multi-cell MU-MIMO scheme for the downlink LTE-advanced system","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Downlink","Throughput","MIMO","System performance","Scheduling algorithm","Array signal processing","Interference elimination","Long Term Evolution","Delay","OFDM"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["3G mobile communication","MIMO communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["coordinated multicell MU-MIMO scheme","downlink LTE-advanced system","intercell interference","spectral efficiency requirements","multicell block diagonalization algorithm","proportional fair scheduling algorithm","coordinated eNodeBs"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Coordinated Multi-Cell MU-MIMO","LTE-Advanced","block diagonalization","PF"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5449903/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Sept. 2009","displayDocTitle":"A coordinated multi-cell MU-MIMO scheme for the downlink LTE-advanced system","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5449903/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"11244481","dateOfInsertion":"15 April 2010","conferenceDate":"13-16 Sept. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A coordinated multi-cell MU-MIMO scheme for the downlink LTE-advanced system","confLoc":"Tokyo, Japan","sourcePdf":"1569227743.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06243S","chronDate":"13-16 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5443865","isNumber":"5449713","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5443865","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5449713","articleId":"5449903","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":5449904,"authors":[{"name":"Ahmad M.

Cell-level coordinated resource allocation and handover (HO) are the two key technologies for achieving these goals. They have been investigated intensively, however, mainly separately. In this paper, a novel combined Handover Guarantee and Interference Mitigation (HGIM) cell-level resource allocation scheme is proposed. HGIM defines the Handover User Set (HUS) and grants higher allocation priority to handover users. Other active users are prioritized based on a unified cell division model which divides a cell into different ICI sensitive areas. Meanwhile, HGIM defines a Sub-carrier Preferred List (SPL) to optimize allocation. Simulation results show that HGIM achieves greater ICI mitigation and improved handover performance compared with the conventional soft frequency reuse scheme.","doi":"10.1109/PIMRC.2009.5449906","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE 20th International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE 20th International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5443865/5449713/05449906.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.2009.5449906","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5449713","startPage":"783","endPage":"787","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Priority-based resource allocation to Guarantee Handover and Mitigate Interference for OFDMA system","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5449906","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Priority-based resource allocation to Guarantee Handover and Mitigate Interference for OFDMA system","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Sept. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5449906/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"13-16 Sept. 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"11244484","dateOfInsertion":"15 April 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5449906/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Priority-based resource allocation to Guarantee Handover and Mitigate Interference for OFDMA system","confLoc":"Tokyo, Japan","sourcePdf":"1569227754.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.093375S","chronDate":"13-16 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5443865","isNumber":"5449713","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5443865","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"5449713","articleId":"5449906","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5449907,"authors":[{"name":"Wenjie Jiang","affiliation":["NTT Network Innovation Laboratories, NTT Corporation, Yokosuka, Kanagawa, Japan"],"firstName":"Wenjie","lastName":"Jiang","id":"37273927600"},{"name":"Yusuke Asai","affiliation":["NTT Network Innovation Laboratories, NTT Corporation, Yokosuka, Kanagawa, Japan"],"firstName":"Yusuke","lastName":"Asai","id":"37279138900"},{"name":"Shuji Kubota","affiliation":["College of Engineering, Shibaura Institute of Technology, Koto, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Shuji","lastName":"Kubota","id":"37266418200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5122-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5123-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2166-9570"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2166-9589"}],"articleNumber":"5449907","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":114},"abstract":"In multiple antenna systems employing spatial multiplexing to raise data rates, it is preferable to use maximum likelihood (ML) detection to fully benefit from multiplexing and diversity gain.

A hybrid simulation/analysis approach is taken, where the queueing model is coupled with a peak rate distribution obtained via simulation.

Intersensor communication costs are reduced significantly by applying the theory of compressive sensing, which indicates that sparse signals can be recovered from far fewer samples than that needed by the Nyquist sampling theorem. We represent the pair-wise distance measurement as a sparse matrix. Instead of sending full pair-wise measurement data to a central node, each sensor transmits only a small number of compressive measurements. And the full pair-wise distance matrix can be well reconstructed from these noisy compressive measurements in the central node, only through an \u00bf\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1</sub>\n-minimization algorithm. The proposed method reduces the overall communication bandwidth requirement per sensor such that it increases logarithmically with the number of sensors and linearly with the number of neighbors, while achieves high localization accuracy.

By exploiting the refined DOA estimate, an eigenspace beamformer incorporating with the spatial derivative constraints (SDC) is then used to further mitigate desired signal cancellation. Analysis and numerical results demonstrate the robustness against pointing errors and superiority over conventional methods.","doi":"10.1109/PIMRC.2009.5449920","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE 20th International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5443865/5449713/05449920.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5449713","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.2009.5449920","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE 20th International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications","startPage":"983","endPage":"987","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A two-stage beamformer with enhanced resistance against larger pointing errors","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5449920","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Sept. 2009","displayDocTitle":"A two-stage beamformer with enhanced resistance against larger pointing errors","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5449920/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5449920/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"11244498","dateOfInsertion":"15 April 2010","conferenceDate":"13-16 Sept. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A two-stage beamformer with enhanced resistance against larger pointing errors","confLoc":"Tokyo, Japan","sourcePdf":"1569227826.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.037475S","chronDate":"13-16 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5443865","isNumber":"5449713","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5443865","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5449713","articleId":"5449920","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5449922,"authors":[{"name":"Aggelos Saatsakis","affiliation":["University of Piraeus, Piraeus, Greece"],"firstName":"Aggelos","lastName":"Saatsakis","id":"37391787400"},{"name":"Panagiotis Demestichas","affiliation":["University of Piraeus, Piraeus, Greece"],"firstName":"Panagiotis","lastName":"Demestichas","id":"37272959700"},{"name":"Vincent Merat","affiliation":["NEC Technologies (UK) Limited, Paris, France"],"firstName":"Vincent","lastName":"Merat","id":"37391780000"},{"name":"Christine Le Page","affiliation":["NEC Technologies (UK) Limited, Paris, France"],"firstName":"Christine","lastName":"Le Page","id":"37391824300"},{"name":"Thomas Loewel","affiliation":["Alcatel-Lucent, Germany"],"firstName":"Thomas","lastName":"Loewel","id":"37391824600"},{"name":"Klaus Nolte","affiliation":["Alcatel-Lucent, Germany"],"firstName":"Klaus","lastName":"Nolte","id":"37391744000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5122-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5123-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2166-9570"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2166-9589"}],"articleNumber":"5449922","dbTime":"14 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":329},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Base stations","Project management","Software radio","Transceivers","Appropriate technology","Rats","Radio spectrum management","Technology management","Self-organizing networks","Hardware"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","mobility management (mobile radio)","software radio","telecommunication network planning","transceivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["flexible base station cognitive management","wireless infrastructures","femtocells","software defined radio transceivers","radio access technologies","mobile terminals","network decision entity","dynamic self-organizing network planning and management","high level system architecture"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Femtocell","flexible base station","cognitive network management"]}],"abstract":"In this paper we discuss on the cognitive management of wireless infrastructures that encompass Flexible Base Stations (FBSs) and Femtocells investigated by the Integrated Project E3 (End-to-End-Efficiency) funded within FP7.

In order to mitigate this problem, the IEEE 802.16 maintenance group has recently proposed a persistent allocation scheme to increase the voice over IP (VoIP) system capacity. However, it is difficult to use the conventional modulation and coding scheme (MCS) selection algorithms, which are based on instantaneous SINR, for the persistent allocation scheme. In this paper, we propose MCS selection algorithms which are effective for using radio resources considering a hybrid ARQ retransmission mechanisms while satisfying given QoS requirements for the persistent allocation scheme.

When a BS operates with time division duplex mode (TDD), synchronization of the transmission time at the BS is important to avoid inter-slot interference with adjacent BSs. Because femto BSs are generally located indoor, they may not receive the global positioning system (GPS) signal which is used to synchronize the wireless cellular network. We propose a multi-hop based network synchronization scheme for femtocell systems.

Its main technical objective is to achieve a reduction of the overall energy consumption of mobile broadband networks by 50%. In contrast to previous efforts, EARTH regards both network aspects and individual radio components from a holistic point of view. Considering that the signal strength strongly decreases with the distance to the base station, small cells are more energy efficient than large cells. EARTH will develop corresponding deployment strategies as well as management algorithms and protocols on the network level. On the component level, the project focuses on base station optimizations as power amplifiers consume the most energy in the system. A power efficient transceiver will be developed that adapts to changing traffic load for an energy efficient operation in mobile radio systems. With these results EARTH will reduce energy costs and carbon dioxide emissions and will thus enable a sustainable increase of mobile data rates.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"EARTH \u2014 Energy Aware Radio and Network Technologies","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE 20th International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications","doi":"10.1109/PIMRC.2009.5449938","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE 20th International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5443865/5449713/05449938.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.2009.5449938","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5449713","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5449938","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5449938/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Sept. 2009","displayDocTitle":"EARTH \u2014 Energy Aware Radio and Network Technologies","conferenceDate":"13-16 Sept. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5449938/","dateOfInsertion":"15 April 2010","publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"11244514","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"EARTH \u2014 Energy Aware Radio and Network Technologies","confLoc":"Tokyo, Japan","sourcePdf":"WS66EARTHcameraready.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.0492S","chronDate":"13-16 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5443865","isNumber":"5449713","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5443865","citationCount":"70","xplore-issue":"5449713","articleId":"5449938","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-28"},{"_id":5449939,"authors":[{"name":"Ivaylo Haratcherev","affiliation":["Centre de Villarceaux, Alcatel-Lucent, Bell Laboratories, Nozay, France"],"firstName":"Ivaylo","lastName":"Haratcherev","id":"37391782600"},{"name":"Carine Balageas","affiliation":["Centre de Villarceaux, Alcatel-Lucent, Bell Laboratories, Nozay, France"],"firstName":"Carine","lastName":"Balageas","id":"37391783200"},{"name":"Michele Fiorito","affiliation":["Politecnico di Turino, Alcatel-Lucent, Bell Laboratories, Torino, Italy","Eur\u00e9com, Sophia-Antipolis, France"],"firstName":"Michele","lastName":"Fiorito","id":"37391788600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5122-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5123-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2166-9570"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2166-9589"}],"articleNumber":"5449939","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":459},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Base stations","Energy consumption","Hardware","Switches","Radio frequency","Batteries","Personal digital assistants","Security","Humans","Radio control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","radiofrequency interference","wireless LAN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["low consumption home femto base stations","power consumption","eco-designed sleep modes","interference","femto base station radio emission","second low-power channel","out-of-band control information","Wi-Fi demonstrator"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Energy saving","femtocell","sleep mode","low-power consumption","sensor networks","reverse paging","Wi-Fi"]}],"abstract":"The expected massive adoption of home femto base stations will increase the overall power consumption, requiring eco-designed sleep modes.

The security issues, although critical, have been less explored in the literature of CRN. In this paper, we consider a secure CRN in which a multi-antenna secondary user (SU) transmitter sends confidential information to a SU receiver on the same frequency band with a primary user (PU) in the presence of an eavesdropper. All receive terminals are equipped with a single antenna. The capacity-achieving transmitter design is formulated as a quasiconvex optimization problem to maximize the rate of the secondary link while avoiding harmful interference to the PU and preventing the eavesdropper from decoding the messages sent. By exploring the inherent convexity, the original problem is solved efficiently by a single semidefinite program (SDP). Besides, two suboptimal algorithms are proposed to reduce the computational complexity, namely, scaled secret beamforming (SSB) and projected secret beamforming (PSB). It is shown through computer simulations that the two suboptimal algorithms can achieve close-to-optimal secrecy capacity under certain conditions.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5449942/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Sept. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"15 April 2010","accessionNumber":"11244518","htmlLink":"/document/5449942/","conferenceDate":"13-16 Sept. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Achieving cognitive and secure transmissions using multiple antennas","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Achieving cognitive and secure transmissions using multiple antennas","confLoc":"Tokyo, Japan","sourcePdf":"9LiangI2RpaperCogCloud09.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.133841S","chronDate":"13-16 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5443865","isNumber":"5449713","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5443865","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"5449713","articleId":"5449942","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5449944,"authors":[{"name":"Sang-wook Han","affiliation":["Department of EE, University of Incheon, Incheon, South Korea","Department of ECE, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada"],"firstName":"Sang-wook","lastName":"Han","id":"37404243500"},{"name":"Hoon Kim","affiliation":["Department of EE, University of Incheon, Incheon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Hoon","lastName":"Kim","id":"37280358800"},{"name":"Youngnam Han","affiliation":["Department of EE, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejeon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Youngnam","lastName":"Han","id":"37280849300"},{"name":"Victor Cm.

A precoded in-band pilots design for OFDM signal (PIP-OFDM) is proposed in this paper to simplify the spectrum sensing and signal identification for dynamic spectrum sharing. The actual design of pilot signal in this OFDM system contains two groups of pilot tones, i.e. uniform pilot tones and identification pilot tones. Combining the two groups of pilot tones embedded in the OFDM signal, the spectrum sensing based on detecting the energy on pilot tones achieves an exceptionally good performance. In addition, the unique identification pilot code design for each transmitter in this network makes the signal identification easy and reliable. Theoretical analysis and simulation show that this design works well in spectrum sensing and signal identification at low SNR.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design and exploitation of precoded in-band pilots for OFDM signal in cognitive radio","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE 20th International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications","doi":"10.1109/PIMRC.2009.5449965","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE 20th International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5443865/5449713/05449965.pdf","startPage":"1776","endPage":"1780","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.2009.5449965","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5449713","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5449965","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5449965/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Sept. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Design and exploitation of precoded in-band pilots for OFDM signal in cognitive radio","conferenceDate":"13-16 Sept. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5449965/","dateOfInsertion":"15 April 2010","publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"11244540","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design and exploitation of precoded in-band pilots for OFDM signal in cognitive radio","confLoc":"Tokyo, Japan","sourcePdf":"1569227916.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068315S","chronDate":"13-16 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5443865","isNumber":"5449713","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5443865","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5449713","articleId":"5449965","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5449969,"authors":[{"name":"Khanh Tran Gia","affiliation":["Tokyo Institute of Technology, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Khanh Tran","lastName":"Gia","id":"37391758100"},{"name":"Kei Sakaguchi","affiliation":["Tokyo Institute of Technology, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Kei","lastName":"Sakaguchi","id":"37266412100"},{"name":"Kiyomichi Araki","affiliation":["Tokyo Institute of Technology, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Kiyomichi","lastName":"Araki","id":"37270249500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5122-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5123-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2166-9570"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2166-9589"}],"articleNumber":"5449969","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":304},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wireless mesh networks","MIMO","Relays","Multiaccess communication","Access protocols","Media Access Protocol","Mesh networks","Wireless sensor networks","Delay","Resource management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","carrier sense multiple access","interference suppression","MIMO communication","wireless mesh networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO two-way relay","CSMA-CA based protocols","infrastructure wireless mesh network","public wireless access network","sensor network","low resource utilization","multichannel MAC","directional MAC","multiple antenna techniques","cross-layer design","interference cancellation","bidirectional stream multiplexing","TDMA-TDD","PHY-MAC protocol","network simulator","network throughput","packet delay reduction","CSMA/CA mesh networks","packet relaying mechanism"]}],"abstract":"Infrastructure wireless mesh network has been attracted much of attention due to a wide range of its application such as public wireless access, sensor network, etc. The application of well-known CSMA/CA based MAC protocols to mesh network, however, reveals high latency and low resource utilization due to problems of hidden terminal, exposed terminal, information asymmetry etc. Several alternative protocols including directional MAC, multichannel MAC only provide marginal improvement. In recent publication, a cross-layer design employing multiple antenna techniques called MIMO two-way relay is proposed for one dimensional mesh network. Owing to interference cancellation and bidirectional stream multiplexing ability of MIMO in combination with an efficient channel access scheme of TDMA/TDD, MIMO two-way relay provides significantly high end-to-end capacity. In this paper, we propose MIMO two-way relay as an alternative PHY/MAC protocol of CSMA/CA. A network simulator employing MIMO two-way relay is developed and more details on packet relaying mechanism of the algorithm are presented. Simulation results show that MIMO two-way relay achieves an extremely large improvement in network throughput, and packet delay reduction in comparison with CSMA/CA mesh networks.","doi":"10.1109/PIMRC.2009.5449969","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE 20th International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE 20th International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5443865/5449713/05449969.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.2009.5449969","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5449713","startPage":"701","endPage":"705","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Wireless mesh network performance: MIMO two-way relay vs. CSMA/CA based protocols","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5449969","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Wireless mesh network performance: MIMO two-way relay vs. CSMA/CA based protocols","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Sept. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5449969/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"13-16 Sept. 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"11244544","dateOfInsertion":"15 April 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5449969/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Wireless mesh network performance: MIMO two-way relay vs. CSMA/CA based protocols","confLoc":"Tokyo, Japan","sourcePdf":"1569229322.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066529S","chronDate":"13-16 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5443865","isNumber":"5449713","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5443865","xplore-issue":"5449713","articleId":"5449969","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5449971,"authors":[{"name":"Antoine O.

Users have no (or very limited) channel state information. They employ space-time trellis codes to improve the reliability of their transmission link. Transmission occurs on fading multipath channels. Prior to transmission, users' spacetime codewords are interleaved in order to break channel memory. The multiuser joint decoding at the base station (assuming perfect channel state information) is reformulated as the computation of marginal probabilities on dense layered factor graphs with loops. This computation is done by means of the sum-product algorithm. We derive several instances of the sum-product algorithm by modifying the topology of the loopy graph and the definition of the corresponding exchanged messages and show through simulations that those variations can substantially impact the final delivered marginals.","doi":"10.1109/PIMRC.2009.5449971","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE 20th International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE 20th International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5443865/5449713/05449971.pdf","startPage":"2554","endPage":"2560","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.2009.5449971","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5449713","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sum-product decoding of layered space-time trellis coded signals over MIMO fading multipath channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5449971","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Sept. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5449971/","displayDocTitle":"Sum-product decoding of layered space-time trellis coded signals over MIMO fading multipath channels","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"11244546","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5449971/","conferenceDate":"13-16 Sept. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"15 April 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sum-product decoding of layered space-time trellis coded signals over MIMO fading multipath channels","confLoc":"Tokyo, Japan","sourcePdf":"1569229334.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054138S","chronDate":"13-16 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5443865","isNumber":"5449713","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5443865","xplore-issue":"5449713","articleId":"5449971","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5449972,"authors":[{"name":"Raouia Ayadi","affiliation":["Ecole sup\u00e9rieure des communications de Tunis, Cit\u00e9 Technologie des Communications, Ariana, Tunisia"],"firstName":"Raouia","lastName":"Ayadi","id":"37391791500"},{"name":"In\u00e9s Kammoun","affiliation":["LETI Department, ENIS BPW, Sfax, Tunisia"],"firstName":"In\u00e9s","lastName":"Kammoun","id":"37281923800"},{"name":"Mohamed Siala","affiliation":["Ecole suprieure des communications de Tunis, Cit\u00e9 Technologie des Communications, Ariana, Tunisia"],"firstName":"Mohamed","lastName":"Siala","id":"37298260200"},{"name":"Georges Rodriguez-Guisantes","affiliation":["TELECOM ParisTech, Paris, France"],"firstName":"Georges","lastName":"Rodriguez-Guisantes","id":"38349715600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5122-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5123-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2166-9570"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2166-9589"}],"articleNumber":"5449972","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":116},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fading","OFDM","MIMO","Frequency diversity","Communications technology","Transmitters","Wireless communication","Frequency estimation","Telecommunications","Frequency division multiplexing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","error statistics","MIMO communication","OFDM modulation","space-time codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["noncoherent coding","MIMO-OFDM systems","noncoherent frequency-selective multiple input multiple output","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","frequency-selective channels","space-frequency coding","Grassmann space-time codes","asymptotic pairwise error probability","symbol error performance"]}],"abstract":"This paper deals with the problem of code design for non-coherent frequency-selective Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO)-Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) fading links, where neither the transmitter nor the receiver knows the channel. A simple and classical approach for non coherent (NC) coding for MIMO-OFDM system consists of coding across antennas and time slots on each OFDM subcarrier. Only, this approach does not permit to exploit the diversity of frequency-selective channels. In our aim to exploit this diversity, we propose in this paper a strategy that consists of coding across antennas and OFDM subcarriers (space-frequency coding) within a single OFDM symbol. Our space-frequency (SF) codes are based on NC Grassmann space-time (ST) codes obtained via an exponential map from coherent ST codes. We determine the asymptotic Pairwise Error Probability (PEP) for each scheme in order to evaluate the diversity and the coding gains. Simulations show that compared with the classical approach, our NC-SF codes can get more diversity gain and better symbol error performance.","doi":"10.1109/PIMRC.2009.5449972","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE 20th International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE 20th International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5443865/5449713/05449972.pdf","startPage":"3243","endPage":"3247","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.2009.5449972","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5449713","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Non coherent coding for MIMO-OFDM systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5449972","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Sept. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5449972/","displayDocTitle":"Non coherent coding for MIMO-OFDM systems","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"11244547","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5449972/","conferenceDate":"13-16 Sept. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"15 April 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Non coherent coding for MIMO-OFDM systems","confLoc":"Tokyo, Japan","sourcePdf":"1569229340.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047844S","chronDate":"13-16 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5443865","isNumber":"5449713","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5443865","xplore-issue":"5449713","articleId":"5449972","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5449974,"authors":[{"name":"P.

We consider a system with a transmit and a receive node, and a set of relay nodes. We assume there is no direct link between the transmit and receive nodes. Each node is equipped with a single antenna. The relay nodes perform amplify-and-forward (AF) relaying. The distributed beamforming design based on the assumption of perfect CSI at the relays fails to guarantee the SNR when the CSI available at the relay nodes is imperfect. We present a robust design which ensures that the SNR constraint is satisfied in the presence of imperfect CSI. We adopt a worst-case design and formulate the problem as a convex optimization problem that can be solved efficiently. The robustness of the proposed design to imperfections in CSI is illustrated through simulations.","doi":"10.1109/PIMRC.2009.5449974","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE 20th International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE 20th International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5443865/5449713/05449974.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.2009.5449974","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5449713","startPage":"2345","endPage":"2349","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robust distributed beamforming for wireless relay networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5449974","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Robust distributed beamforming for wireless relay networks","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Sept. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5449974/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"13-16 Sept. 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"11244549","dateOfInsertion":"15 April 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5449974/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust distributed beamforming for wireless relay networks","confLoc":"Tokyo, Japan","sourcePdf":"1569229361.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047291S","chronDate":"13-16 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5443865","isNumber":"5449713","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5443865","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"5449713","articleId":"5449974","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5449975,"authors":[{"name":"K.

Due to the variation of the channel during one OFDM symbol, one-tap channel estimation and the corresponding equalization is no longer the optimum solution and such a variation results in inter-carrier interference (ICI). One of the possible approaches to predict this interfering effect is to use basis expansion model (BEM) with which the variation of the channel can be approximated successfully. However, as the pure BEM does not solve completely the problem, we investigate the estimation problem using decision feedback to enhance the performance. In particular, we propose a simple algorithm based on using two successive OFDM symbols to filter channel coefficients and improve not only the convergence of pure decision feedback based estimation but also the system performance. Simulation results based on Jake's channel model with a high Doppler spread and a practical high data rate system sustain our claims.","doi":"10.1109/PIMRC.2009.5449978","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE 20th International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE 20th International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5443865/5449713/05449978.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.2009.5449978","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5449713","startPage":"2404","endPage":"2408","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An iterative channel estimator for fast-varying channels using successive OFDM symbols","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5449978","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"An iterative channel estimator for fast-varying channels using successive OFDM symbols","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Sept. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5449978/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"13-16 Sept. 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"11244553","dateOfInsertion":"15 April 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5449978/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An iterative channel estimator for fast-varying channels using successive OFDM symbols","confLoc":"Tokyo, Japan","sourcePdf":"1569229383.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068558S","chronDate":"13-16 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5443865","isNumber":"5449713","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5443865","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"5449713","articleId":"5449978","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":5449984,"authors":[{"name":"Mikio Hasegawa","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Tokyo University of Science, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Mikio","lastName":"Hasegawa","id":"37270352600"},{"name":"Akira Funatsu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Tokyo University of Science, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Akira","lastName":"Funatsu","id":"37391783800"},{"name":"Hiroshi Harada","affiliation":["Ubiquitous Mobile Communications Group, NICT, Yokosuka, Japan"],"firstName":"Hiroshi","lastName":"Harada","id":"37276707400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5122-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5123-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2166-9570"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2166-9589"}],"articleNumber":"5449984","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":100},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5449984","abstract":"We propose a distributed radio resource usage optimization algorithm to satisfy users' QoS requirements in heterogeneous wireless networks.

PAA with phase shifters for each element antenna is partitioned into sub-blocks and each block is applied a common baseband beamforming weight. To suppress the grating lobes of beam pattern and to maintain the signal to interference plus noise ratio (SINR) of users in the SDMA system, we study the design of this HBF using convex optimization. Two design criteria are considered herein: one minimizes the transmit power subject to a SINR constraint, and the other maximizes the worst case SINR subject to a total power constraint. Simulation results show that both the SINR and directivity of HBF can be significantly improved by making use of the convex optimization technique.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.2009.5449993","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5449713","startPage":"823","endPage":"827","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE 20th International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5443865/5449713/05449993.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hybrid beamforming using convex optimization for SDMA in millimeter wave radio","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5449993/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Sept. 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5449993/","displayDocTitle":"Hybrid beamforming using convex optimization for SDMA in millimeter wave radio","conferenceDate":"13-16 Sept. 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"11244568","dateOfInsertion":"15 April 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hybrid beamforming using convex optimization for SDMA in millimeter wave radio","confLoc":"Tokyo, Japan","sourcePdf":"1569229154.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045153S","chronDate":"13-16 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5443865","isNumber":"5449713","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5443865","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"5449713","articleId":"5449993","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5449996,"authors":[{"name":"Junyi Wang","affiliation":["National Institute of Information and Communications Technology, Yokosuka, Japan"],"firstName":"Junyi","lastName":"Wang","id":"37406465900"},{"name":"Zhou Lan","affiliation":["National Institute of Information and Communications Technology, Yokosuka, Japan"],"firstName":"Zhou","lastName":"Lan","id":"37409324600"},{"name":"Ryuhei Funada","affiliation":["National Institute of Information and Communications Technology, Yokosuka, Japan"],"firstName":"Ryuhei","lastName":"Funada","id":"37297585200"},{"name":"Hiroshi Harada","affiliation":["National Institute of Information and Communications Technology, Yokosuka, Japan"],"firstName":"Hiroshi","lastName":"Harada","id":"37276707400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5122-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5123-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2166-9570"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2166-9589"}],"articleNumber":"5449996","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":228},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["WiMAX","Iterative algorithms","Scheduling algorithm","Resource management","Throughput","Round robin","Media Access Protocol","MIMO","OFDM","Channel state information"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["access protocols","frequency division multiple access","MIMO communication","OFDM modulation","resource allocation","WiMax"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power allocation","multiuser MIMO-OFDMA","WiMAX systems","radio resource allocation scheme","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing access systems","channel state information","resource block","3D slot assignment","1D single input single output","worldwide interoperability for microwave access systems","IEEE 802.16","media access control protocols","MAC protocols","round On robin scheme","scheduling process"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we propose a radio resource allocation (RRA) scheme for multiuser multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) orthogonal frequency division multiplexing access (OFDMA) systems in order to achieve the optimal system throughput. The proposed RRA algorithm adaptively schedules 3-dimension (3-D) (space, frequency and time) slots to different users according to various channel state information (CSI). Different from most of conventional RRA algorithms, the proposed algorithm joins scheduling process with power allocation, that is, iteratively allocating total transmit power into resource block (RB) during 3-D slot assignment. The power allocation is an extension of the space-frequency waterfilling algorithm, and is adapted to an equivalent 1-D single input single output (SISO) channels. The equivalent SISO channels are obtained from the original 3-D RBs in the sense of the same maximum achievable throughput. The proposed algorithm was confirmed in the Worldwide interoperability for Microwave Access (WiMAX) systems following IEEE 802.16e media access control (MAC) protocols. It is shown that the proposed RRA algorithm significantly simplifies the scheduling process and achieves more throughput than round robin (RR) scheme.","doi":"10.1109/PIMRC.2009.5449996","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE 20th International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE 20th International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5443865/5449713/05449996.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.2009.5449996","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5449713","startPage":"2752","endPage":"2756","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On scheduling and power allocation over multiuser MIMO-OFDMA: Fundamental design and performance evaluation in WiMAX systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5449996","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"On scheduling and power allocation over multiuser MIMO-OFDMA: Fundamental design and performance evaluation in WiMAX systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Sept. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5449996/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"13-16 Sept. 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"11244571","dateOfInsertion":"15 April 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5449996/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On scheduling and power allocation over multiuser MIMO-OFDMA: Fundamental design and performance evaluation in WiMAX systems","confLoc":"Tokyo, Japan","sourcePdf":"1569229209.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042587S","chronDate":"13-16 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5443865","isNumber":"5449713","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5443865","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5449713","articleId":"5449996","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5449997,"authors":[{"name":"Chiya Saeidi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Iran University of Science and Technology, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Chiya","lastName":"Saeidi","id":"37300004600"},{"name":"Farrokh Hodjatkashani","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Iran University of Science and Technology, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Farrokh","lastName":"Hodjatkashani","id":"37391792700"},{"name":"Azim Fard","affiliation":["Communications Regulatory Authority, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Azim","lastName":"Fard","id":"37302082900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5122-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5123-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2166-9570"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2166-9589"}],"articleNumber":"5449997","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":161},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Ray tracing","Solid modeling","Diffraction","Acceleration","Computer vision","Spatial databases","Reflection","Computer networks","Computational modeling","Face"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CAD","electrical engineering computing","electromagnetic wave diffraction","electromagnetic wave propagation","electromagnetic wave reflection","ray tracing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ray tracing propagation model","computer-aided outdoor network design","field strength calculations","efficient geometrical environment database preprocessing technique","field strength prediction","reflective surfaces","diffractive edges","interfacet visibility distance"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["propagation","ray tracing"]}],"abstract":"In a computer-aided outdoor network design a huge amount of field strength calculations is required; therefore, development of an efficient calculation model is a challenge.
