This method increases optical amplifier repeater spacing by setting a normal dispersion fiber as a transmission fiber, and by setting a 1.3- mu m zero-dispersion wavelength fiber as a dispersion compensator at the end in each repeater spacing so as to keep the total dispersion of the complete amplifier repeater spacing at around zero. Employing this method, a less than 1-dB power penalty, 10-Gb/s, 950-km transmission has been demonstrated, keeping the repeater spacings at 95 km and setting the repeater output power at 13 dBm.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/250062/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  1993","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov.  1993","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Nov. 1993","accessionNumber":"4662167","volume":"5","issue":"11","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"An arrangement of transmission-fiber dispersions for increasing the spacing between optical amplifiers in lumped repeater systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An arrangement of transmission-fiber dispersions for increasing the spacing between optical amplifiers in lumped repeater systems","sourcePdf":"00250062.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.022054S","chronDate":"Nov.  1993","isNumber":"6399","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"68","citationCount":"5","articleId":"250062","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Letter","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":250065,"authors":[{"name":"R.D.

A microwave signal is transmitted on a wavelength-tunable optical carrier through a fiber-optic prism-a set of nominally equal-delay fibers with differing net dispersion-to photodetectors that feed each antenna element. The relative interelement time-delay (beam angle) adjustment is accomplished by tuning the optical carrier wavelength. Measured antenna patterns of a two-element array clearly demonstrate beam steering and true time-delay operation over a two-octave bandwidth of 2-8 GHz.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/68.250065","publicationTitle":"IEEE Photonics Technology Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Photonics Technology Letters","pdfPath":"/iel3/68/6399/00250065.pdf","startPage":"1347","endPage":"1349","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/68.250065","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6399","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fiber-optic prism true time-delay antenna feed","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=250065","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov.  1993","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  1993","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/250065/","displayDocTitle":"Fiber-optic prism true time-delay antenna feed","volume":"5","issue":"11","publicationDate":"Nov. 1993","accessionNumber":"4662170","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fiber-optic prism true time-delay antenna feed","sourcePdf":"00250065.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.081972S","chronDate":"Nov.  1993","isNumber":"6399","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"68","citationCount":"86","articleId":"250065","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Letter","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":250074,"authors":[{"name":"R.

Three classes of database mining problems involving classification, associations, and sequences are described. It is argued that these problems can be uniformly viewed as requiring discovery of rules embedded in massive amounts of data. A model and some basic operations for the process of rule discovery are described. It is shown how the database mining problems considered map to this model, and how they can be solved by using the basic operations proposed. An example is given of an algorithm for classification obtained by combining the basic rule discovery operations. This algorithm is efficient in discovering classification rules and has accuracy comparable to ID3, one of the best current classifiers.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","supplementGroup":[{"repository":"IEEE DataPort","type":"dataset","badge":"Available","badgeMsg":"This document includes datasets submitted by the author.","supplement":[{"doi":"10.21227/H25P49","name":"Population Sample Artificially Generated"}]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/250074/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1993","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1993","publicationDate":"Dec. 1993","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4646185","volume":"5","issue":"6","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Database mining: a performance perspective","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Database mining: a performance perspective","sourcePdf":"00250074.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.037032S","chronDate":"Dec.  1993","isNumber":"6400","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"69","citationCount":"528","articleId":"250074","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-10"},{"_id":250075,"authors":[{"name":"V.

Security issues involved in database concurrency control for MLS/DBMSs are examined, and it is shown how a scheduler can affect security. Data conflict security, (DC-security), a property that implies a system is free of covert channels due to contention for access to data, is introduced. A definition of DC-security based on noninterference is presented. Two properties that constitute a necessary condition for DC-security are introduced along with two simpler necessary conditions. A class of schedulers called output-state-equivalent is identified for which another criterion implies DC-security. The criterion considers separately the behavior of the scheduler in response to those inputs that cause rollback and those that do not. The security properties of several existing scheduling protocols are characterized. Many are found to be insecure.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/250090/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1993","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1993","volume":"5","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 1993","accessionNumber":"4646201","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","displayDocTitle":"Database concurrency control in multilevel secure database management systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Database concurrency control in multilevel secure database management systems","sourcePdf":"00250090.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.046046S","chronDate":"Dec 1993","isNumber":"6400","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"69","citationCount":"19","articleId":"250090","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":250091,"authors":[{"name":"S.V.

Identified by the acronym ATAMM, for Algorithm to Architecture Mapping Model, the model is important because it specifies criteria for a multiprocessor operating system to achieve predictable and reliable performance. Algorithm performance is characterized by execution time and iteration period. For a given data flow graph representation, the model facilitates calculation of greatest lower bounds for these performance measures. When sufficient processors are available, the system executes algorithms with minimum execution time and minimum iteration period, and the number of processors required is calculated. When only limited processors are available or when processors fail, performance is made to degrade gracefully and predictably. The user off-line is able to specify tradeoffs between increasing execution time or increasing iteration period. The approach to achieving predictable performance is to control the injection rate of input data and to modify the data flow graph precedence relations so that a processor is always available to execute an enabled graph node. An implementation of the ATAMM model in a four-processor architecture based on Westinghouse's VHSIC 1750A Instruction Set Processor is described.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/71.250100","startPage":"1205","endPage":"1216","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/71.250100","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6401","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","pdfPath":"/iel4/71/6401/00250100.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Prediction of performance and processor requirements in real-time data flow architectures","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/250100/","displayDocTitle":"Prediction of performance and processor requirements in real-time data flow architectures","volume":"4","issue":"11","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4600453","publicationDate":"Nov. 1993","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1993","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1993","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Prediction of performance and processor requirements in real-time data flow architectures","sourcePdf":"00250100.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.039471S","chronDate":"Nov 1993","isNumber":"6401","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"71","citationCount":"6","articleId":"250100","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":250102,"authors":[{"name":"S.G.

The size of this class of regular networks can be easily extended by increments of a cluster size. Local communication, to be satisfied by the hypercube topology, allows easy embedding of existing parallel algorithms, while the de Bruijn graph, which was chosen for JPL's 8096-node multiprocessor, provides the shortest distance between clusters running different parts of an application. A scheme for obtaining WSI layout is introduced and used to estimate the number of tracks needed and the required area of the wafer. The exact number of tracks in the hypercube and an approximation for the de Bruijn graph are also obtained.

The proposed algorithm splits the usual hash phase into a hash phase and an explicit transfer phase, and adds an extra scheduling phase between these two. During the scheduling phase, a heuristic optimization algorithm, using the output of the hash phase, attempts to balance the load across the multiple processors in the subsequent join phase. The algorithm naturally identifies the hash partitions with the largest skew values and splits them as necessary, assigning each of them to an optimal number of processors. Assuming for concreteness a Zipf-like distribution of the values in the join column, a join phase which is CPU-bound, and a shared nothing environment, the algorithm is shown to achieve good join phase load balancing, and to be robust relative to the degree of data skew and the total number of processors. The overall speedup due to this algorithm is compared to some existing parallel hash join methods. The proposed method does considerably better in high skew situations.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/71.250117","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","pdfPath":"/iel4/71/6402/00250117.pdf","startPage":"1355","endPage":"1371","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/71.250117","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6402","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A parallel hash join algorithm for managing data skew","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/250117/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1993","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1993","displayDocTitle":"A parallel hash join algorithm for managing data skew","volume":"4","issue":"12","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 1993","accessionNumber":"4611040","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A parallel hash join algorithm for managing data skew","sourcePdf":"00250117.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.099723S","chronDate":"Dec 1993","isNumber":"6402","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"71","citationCount":"26","articleId":"250117","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":250128,"authors":[{"name":"R.

The proposed architecture can easily meet the speed requirement of 14.3 MHz real-time operation with the current 2 mu m CMOS technology.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Fundamental Theory and Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Fundamental Theory and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel4/81/6404/00250161.pdf","startPage":"705","endPage":"712","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the realization of discrete cosine transform using the distributed arithmetic","doi":"10.1109/81.250161","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6404","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/81.250161","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=250161","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/250161/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1992","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1992","displayDocTitle":"On the realization of discrete cosine transform using the distributed arithmetic","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Sept. 1992","accessionNumber":"4376272","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"39","issue":"9","isJournal":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the realization of discrete cosine transform using the distributed arithmetic","sourcePdf":"00250161.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.032208S","chronDate":"Sep 1992","isNumber":"6404","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"81","citationCount":"68","articleId":"250161","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":250162,"authors":[{"name":"B.S.

Therefore, the unique set of sets of primes that forms the covering problem can be implicitly represented by a set of cubes that forms a minimum canonical cover.

CMOS DPTL offers significant power-delay product advantages over conventional CMOS logic for both 5-V and 3-V power supplies. These features are achieved by DPTL's fewer and smaller parasitic capacitances, which are the result of significantly lower device counts combined with emphasized usage of minimum-size, n-channel pass-transistors. Substantial benefits are also obtained by using DPTL with depletion and enhancement/depletion GaAs MESFET technologies. Experiments show that GaAs DPTL offers substantial power-delay-product reductions over conventional GaAs realizations. Compared to CMOS DPTL, GaAs DPTL consumes less power at very high frequencies, a consequence of the electronic properties of GaAs and the smaller signal swings used in emitter/drain (E/D) DPTL.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/101.250230","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00250230.png","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Circuits and Devices Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel1/101/6406/00250230.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6406","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/101.250230","publicationTitle":"IEEE Circuits and Devices Magazine","startPage":"23","endPage":"28","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Differential pass-transistor logic","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=250230","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  1993","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"July  1993","displayDocTitle":"Differential pass-transistor logic","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/250230/","volume":"9","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"July 1993","accessionNumber":"4500817","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Differential pass-transistor logic","sourcePdf":"00250230.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.030496S","chronDate":"July  1993","isNumber":"6406","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"101","citationCount":"17","articleId":"250230","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":250381,"authors":[{"name":"Chunmeng Wu","affiliation":["Bell-Northern Res., Ottawa, Ont., Canada"],"lastName":"Chunmeng Wu","id":"37087290640"},{"name":"T.

These transient processes are dominated by 100-500 kHz periodic pulse-energy modulations and are inherent to the Kerr-lens mode-locking mechanism based on the intensity dependent transverse-beam profile of the laser and the long gain relaxation lifetime (3.2 ps) of the Ti:sapphire rod. We observe that when the slit width is decreased from 2 mm to 1.4 mm the modulation period increases from 2 ps to 10 mu s and amplitude modulation deepens to almost 100%. An explanation similar to repetitive self-Q-switching and undamped relaxation oscillation is presented, which is consistent with the experimental results. A large low-frequency timing jitter on the order of submicroseconds, associated with the periodic pulse-train modulations, is also observed. The timing jitter is analyzed by incorporating the pulse energy modulation into the phase variation through the Kerr effect and consistent results are obtained. We have determined the cavity parameters to control these detrimental processes for stable mode-locked output. The observation of the amplitude modulation further confirms the Kerr-lens self-focusing model of self-mode locking in Ti:sapphire lasers.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/3.250389","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/3.250389","startPage":"2663","endPage":"2669","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Quantum Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel1/3/6410/00250389.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Quantum Electronics","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6410","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Slow amplitude modulation in the pulse train of a self-mode-locked Ti:sapphire laser","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1993","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1993","displayDocTitle":"Slow amplitude modulation in the pulse train of a self-mode-locked Ti:sapphire laser","publicationDate":"Oct. 1993","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","volume":"29","issue":"10","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4644836","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/250389/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Slow amplitude modulation in the pulse train of a self-mode-locked Ti:sapphire laser","sourcePdf":"00250389.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.049799S","chronDate":"Oct 1993","isNumber":"6410","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3","citationCount":"6","articleId":"250389","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":250392,"authors":[{"name":"M.

Detection performance, P/sub D/, is predicted for the two schemes under the assumptions that the input noises are zero-mean complex Gaussian random variables that are temporally independent but spatially correlated; and the amplitude of the desired signal is Rayleigh distributed. P/sub D/ is computed as a function of the false alarm probability, the number of input channels, the number of independent samples per channel, and the matched filtered output signal-to-noise (S/N) power ratio. In this analysis the GLRT is shown to have better detection performance than the MLAD. The difference in detection performance increases as one uses fewer input samples. However, the required number of samples necessary to have only a 3 dB detection loss for both detection schemes is approximately the same. This is significant since for the present, the MLAD is considerably less complex to implement than the GLRT.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/7.250402","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems","pdfPath":"/iel4/7/6411/00250402.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/7.250402","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6411","startPage":"30","endPage":"40","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A comparison of two adaptive detection schemes","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=250402","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A comparison of two adaptive detection schemes","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/250402/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1994","isJournal":true,"volume":"30","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 1994","accessionNumber":"4621324","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A comparison of two adaptive detection schemes","sourcePdf":"250402.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.040738S","chronDate":"Jan 1994","isNumber":"6411","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7","citationCount":"15","articleId":"250402","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":250406,"authors":[{"name":"I.P.

In this principal component inverse (PCI) method, one temporarily regards the interference as a strong signal to be enhanced. The resulting estimate of the interference waveform is subtracted from the observed data, and matched filtering is used to detect signal components in the residual waveform. We also present a generalized likelihood-ratio test (GLRT) for adaptively detecting a low rank signal in the presence of low rank interference. This approach leads to a test which is closely related to the PCI method and extends the PCI method to the case where strong signal components are present in the data. A major accomplishment of the work is our calculation of the statistics of the output of the matched filter for the case in which interference cancellation and signal detection are carried out on the same observed data matrix. That is, no separate data is used for adaptation.

The proposed method involves a preprocessor that focuses the signal spaces at different frequencies to a common one and a narrowband beamformer following the preprocessor. The merits that result as a consequence are partial adaptivity due to single frequency weights and decorrelation of coherent signals thus combating signal cancellation. The latter effect is studied by deriving expressions for the desired-signal distortion in a minimum variance distortionless response (MVDR) beamformer and analyzing them. Implementation issues of the preprocessor are addressed. Simulation results confirm the utility of the focusing preprocessor.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/250407/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1994","volume":"30","issue":"1","accessionNumber":"4621327","publicationDate":"Jan. 1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Broadband focusing for partially adaptive beamforming","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Broadband focusing for partially adaptive beamforming","sourcePdf":"250407.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.035233S","chronDate":"Jan 1994","isNumber":"6411","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7","citationCount":"21","articleId":"250407","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":250409,"authors":[{"name":"K.D.T.

This paper considers how well a Hough transform detector with binary integration improves the performance of a typical surveillance radar. For Hough transform detection, binary integration offers some advantages over noncoherent integration when multiple targets appear in range-time space or when the detector receives signals with a wide range of power. We derive expressions for P/sub F/ and P/sub D/ for a Hough transform binary integrator and apply the expressions to a typical surveillance radar. The results show that for the case considered, the binary Hough integrator improves the power budget of the radar by about 3 dB for a nonfluctuating target and 1 dB for a highly fluctuating target.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/7.250412","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems","pdfPath":"/iel4/7/6411/00250412.pdf","startPage":"116","endPage":"125","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/7.250412","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6411","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Search radar detection and track with the Hough transform.

The threshold of the MLD is determined from the resultant data. Thereafter a candidate cell is compared against this threshold. Probabilities of false alarm and detection are derived as a function of the threshold factor, the order of the matched filter, the number of independent samples per channel used to calculate the adaptive matched filter weights, the number of samples used to set the MLD threshold, and the output signal-to-noise power ratio of the optimal matched filter.

It is shown how input impedance, far-field radiation pattern, radiation efficiency, and the magnitude of the near field are affected by the presence of the human body. The investigations have been carried out by applying the finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) technique to a model of the telephone with a lambda /4 monopole antenna and a simple hand-head model of the operator. Results from this configuration are compared with results for the telephone box and antenna alone. Measurements have been performed to verify the results obtained by simulations. The results show that a shadow effect in the far-field pattern occurs in the direction of the person and that the radiation pattern, including polarization, changes considerably from the telephone with the antenna alone. The impedance results show a change in resonance frequency when the telephone is placed next to a person. Results for radiation efficiency show that close to half of the energy is absorbed by hand and head. On average a system loss of 3-4 dB should be included in a link budget, and there is considerable fading, even in a radio-anechoic chamber, when persons move around in a natural manner.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/8.250451","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel4/8/6412/00250451.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/8.250451","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6412","startPage":"739","endPage":"746","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Effects on portable antennas of the presence of a person","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=250451","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Effects on portable antennas of the presence of a person","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1993","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/250451/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1993","isJournal":true,"volume":"41","issue":"6","publicationDate":"June 1993","accessionNumber":"4505211","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Effects on portable antennas of the presence of a person","sourcePdf":"00250451.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.042842S","chronDate":"Jun 1993","isNumber":"6412","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"208","articleId":"250451","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":250457,"authors":[{"name":"R.M.

In order to do so, two unit cell configurations are studied: (1) the dipole element fed by coplanar transmission lines and (2) the dipole element fed by coplanar transmission lines with finite-height metallic walls added parallel to the H-plane of the array. The element active impedances are calculated for these configurations, and they are compared with those obtained from arrays of dipoles without coplanar feed lines. Effects of the dielectric substrate permittivity and of its thickness on the array element active impedance are included. The results show that the arrays of dipoles with the coplanar feed lines exhibit feed-line-induced blindnesses which reduce considerably the scan volume of the array. It is also shown that these feed line effects are reduced for thicker or higher permittivity substrates, and that the insertion of electric walls is one possible avenue for eliminating these anomalies.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/8.250461","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel4/8/6412/00250461.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/8.250461","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6412","startPage":"837","endPage":"841","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"E-plane scan performance of infinite arrays of dipoles printed on protruding dielectric substrates: coplanar feed line and E-plane metallic wall effects","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=250461","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"E-plane scan performance of infinite arrays of dipoles printed on protruding dielectric substrates: coplanar feed line and E-plane metallic wall effects","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1993","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/250461/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1993","isJournal":true,"volume":"41","issue":"6","publicationDate":"June 1993","accessionNumber":"4505226","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"E-plane scan performance of infinite arrays of dipoles printed on protruding dielectric substrates: coplanar feed line and E-plane metallic wall effects","sourcePdf":"00250461.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.106421S","chronDate":"Jun 1993","isNumber":"6412","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"22","articleId":"250461","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":250466,"authors":[{"name":"Y.-C.

By adopting the information of array element realized gain patterns the authors formulate synthesis problems as nonlinearly constrained optimization problems, and propose a direct method to solve them. The technique allows them to find a set of array coefficients that yield a pattern meeting a specified side-lobe level and achieving the maximum directivity, if such a set of array coefficients exists. If the side-lobe specifications cannot be met with the given array, the technique will result in a set of coefficients that yield a pattern meeting the best attainable side-lobe level and having directivity as high as possible. Simplified synthesis problems for an axial dipole array in an infinite, perfectly conducting cylinder are discussed, and numerical results are given.

The system consists of 3 stages: data collection, feature extraction, and event detection. The feature extractor employs a mimetic approach to detect candidate epileptiform transients on individual channels, while an expert system is used to detect focal and nonfocal multichannel epileptiform events. Considerable use of spatial and temporal contextual information present in the EEG aids both in the detection of epileptiform events and in the rejection of artifacts and background activity as events. Classification of events as definite or probable overcomes, to some extent, the problem of maintaining high detection rates while eliminating false detections. So far, the system has only been evaluated on development data but, although this does not provide a true measure of performance, the results are nevertheless impressive. Data from 11 patients, totaling 180 minutes of 16-channel bipolar EEGs, have been analyzed. A total of 45-71% (average 58%) of epileptiform events reported by the human expert in any EEG were detected as definite with no false detections (i.e., 100% selectivity) and 60-100% (average 80%) as either definite or probable but at the expense of up to 9 false detections per hour. Importantly, the highest detection rates were achieved on EEGs containing little epileptiform activity and no false detections were made on normal EEGs.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/10.250582","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/10/6416/00250582.pdf","startPage":"1260","endPage":"1268","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/10.250582","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6416","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A multistage system to detect epileptiform activity in the EEG","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=250582","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1993","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1993","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/250582/","displayDocTitle":"A multistage system to detect epileptiform activity in the EEG","volume":"40","issue":"12","publicationDate":"Dec. 1993","accessionNumber":"4621304","pubMedId":"8125502","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A multistage system to detect epileptiform activity in the EEG","sourcePdf":"250582.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.041123S","chronDate":"Dec.  1993","isNumber":"6416","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"139","articleId":"250582","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-18"},{"_id":250585,"authors":[{"name":"K.S.

These techniques are used in the training phase of the vector quantizer design. These learning techniques combine the split-and-cluster methodology of the traditional vector quantizer design with neural learning, and lead to better quantizer design (with fewer distortions). The sequential learning approach overcomes the code word underutilization problem of the competitive learning network. As a result, this network only requires partial or zero updating, as opposed to full neighbor updating as needed in the self organizing feature map. The parallel learning network, while satisfying the above characteristics, also leads to parallel learning of the codewords. The parallel learning technique can be used for faster codebook design in a multiprocessor environment. It is shown that this sequential learning scheme can sometimes outperform the traditional LBG algorithm, while the parallel learning scheme performs very close to the LGB and the sequential learning algorithms.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/12.250614","pdfPath":"/iel1/12/6417/00250614.pdf","startPage":"104","endPage":"109","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/12.250614","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6417","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sequential and parallel neural network vector quantizers","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/250614/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1994","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1994","displayDocTitle":"Sequential and parallel neural network vector quantizers","volume":"43","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4627448","publicationDate":"Jan. 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sequential and parallel neural network vector quantizers","sourcePdf":"00250614.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.046777S","chronDate":"Jan 1994","isNumber":"6417","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"4","articleId":"250614","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":250632,"authors":[{"name":"D.

A total scalar potential solution for electrostatic fields and a modified reduced scalar potential solution described here for the 3-D magnetostatic problem may prove most suitable.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/20.250639","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","startPage":"1306","endPage":"1314","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","pdfPath":"/iel1/20/6418/00250639.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/20.250639","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6418","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Finite element applications in electrical engineering","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Finite element methods","Magnetostatics","Eddy currents","Radio frequency","Finite difference methods","Difference equations","Scattering","Solid modeling","Computer aided engineering","Partial differential equations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["eddy currents","electric fields","finite element analysis","magnetic fields","magnetostatics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["two-component vectors","2D magnetostatic problems","electrical engineering","finite element method","low-frequency electrical applications","modeling","three-component vectors","edge elements","force calculations","one-component vector potential methods","eddy current problems","total scalar potential solution","electrostatic fields","modified reduced scalar potential solution","3-D magnetostatic problem"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1993","displayDocTitle":"Finite element applications in electrical engineering","volume":"29","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4443097","publicationDate":"March 1993","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1993","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/250639/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Finite element applications in electrical engineering","sourcePdf":"00250639.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.109085S","chronDate":"March  1993","isNumber":"6418","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"20","citationCount":"20","articleId":"250639","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":250669,"authors":[{"name":"C.

To ensure at least a result very near the global optimum, a theory of disaster can be introduced. After a certain number of standard generations, the stepwidth sigma is increased greatly for a specified number of generations. Descendants arrived at during these generations are more likely to escape a local minimum than ordinary descendants. ( mu / rho , lambda ) evolution strategies can be easily implemented on parallel computers, helping to reduce the real-time requirements for one generation.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/250749/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1993","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1993","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"March 1993","accessionNumber":"4447799","isJournal":true,"volume":"29","issue":"2","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Higher order evolution strategies for the global optimization of electromagnetic devices","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Higher order evolution strategies for the global optimization of electromagnetic devices","sourcePdf":"00250749.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.037357S","chronDate":"March  1993","isNumber":"6418","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"20","citationCount":"29","articleId":"250749","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":250750,"authors":[{"name":"M.L.

Several methods, based on finite-element computation of the magnetic field, for computing the cogging torque and EMF are proposed and compared.

Several concise, practical examples are presented.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Convolutional codes","Decoding","Concatenated codes","Frequency synchronization","Signal to noise ratio","Convolution","Block codes","Signal analysis","Performance analysis","Analytical models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["convolutional codes","decoding","statistical analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["determinate state convolutional code","state transitions","decoding trellis","staged power transfer","performance","concatenated coding system","decoding complexity","free distances","statistical properties","decoder output","simulation results","low signal-to-noise ratios","communications system"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=250827","doi":"10.1109/26.250827","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel1/26/6419/00250827.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/26.250827","startPage":"1785","endPage":"1794","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6419","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Determinate state convolutional codes","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Determinate state convolutional codes","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/250827/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1993","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1993","volume":"41","issue":"12","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Dec. 1993","accessionNumber":"4644949","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Determinate state convolutional codes","sourcePdf":"00250827.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.024769S","chronDate":"Dec 1993","isNumber":"6419","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"48","articleId":"250827","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":250844,"authors":[{"name":"D.J.

It addresses the dependence of phase behavior on the initial filters as well as the image variations that exist between different views of a 3D scene. We are particularly interested in the stability of phase with respect to geometric deformations, and its linearity as a function of spatial position. These properties are important to the use of phase information, and are shown to depend on the form of the filters as well as their frequency bandwidths. Phase instabilities are also discussed using the model of phase singularities described by Jepson and Fleet. In addition to phase-based methods, these results are directly relevant to differential optical flow methods and zero-crossing tracking.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Stability","Optical filters","Robustness","Velocity measurement","Phase measurement","Layout","Linearity","Information filtering","Information filters","Frequency"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["filtering and prediction theory","frequency stability","image processing","image recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["local phase information","image velocity","binocular disparity","robustness","initial filters","3D scene","phase stability","geometric deformations","spatial position","frequency bandwidths","phase singularities","optical flow","zero-crossing tracking"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=250844","doi":"10.1109/34.250844","startPage":"1253","endPage":"1268","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel1/34/6420/00250844.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6420","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/34.250844","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1993","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/250844/","displayDocTitle":"Stability of phase information","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1993","volume":"15","issue":"12","publicationDate":"Dec. 1993","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4609824","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Stability of phase information","sourcePdf":"00250844.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.050325S","chronDate":"Dec 1993","isNumber":"6420","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"145","articleId":"250844","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":250845,"authors":[{"name":"J.H.

Unlike most of the previous research, the approach is based on general techniques for dealing with features with intersecting volumes. Feature interactions are represented explicitly in the recognizer's output, to facilitate spatial reasoning in subsequent planning stages. A generate-and-test strategy is used. OPS-5 production rules generate hints or clues for the existence of features, and post them on a blackboard. The clues are assessed, and those judged promising are processed to ensure that they correspond to actual features, and to gather information for process planning. Computational geometry techniques are used to produce the largest volumetric feature compatible with the available data. The feature's accessibility, and its interactions with others are analyzed. The validity tests ensure that the proposed features are accessible, do not intrude into the desired part, and satisfy other machinability conditions. The process continues until it produces a complete decomposition of the volume to be machined into fully-specified features.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/250845/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1993","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1993","volume":"15","issue":"12","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 1993","accessionNumber":"4609825","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","displayDocTitle":"Spatial reasoning for the automatic recognition of machinable features in solid models","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spatial reasoning for the automatic recognition of machinable features in solid models","sourcePdf":"00250845.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.045923S","chronDate":"Dec 1993","isNumber":"6420","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"176","articleId":"250845","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":250916,"authors":[{"name":"D.J.

It is important to preserve size and shape of the individual calcifications as exactly as possible. A reliable diagnosis requires both rates of false positives as well as false negatives to be extremely low. The proposed approach uses a two-stage algorithm for spot detection and shape extraction. The first stage applies a weighted difference of Gaussians filter for the noise-invariant and size-specific detection of spots. A morphological filter reproduces the shape of the spots. The results of both filters are combined with a conditional thickening operation. The topology and the number of the spots are determined with the first filter, and the shape by means of the second. The algorithm is tested with a series of real mammograms, using identical parameter values for all images. The results are compared with the judgement of radiological experts, and they are very encouraging. The described approach opens up the possibility of a reproducible segmentation of microcalcifications, which is a necessary precondition for an efficient screening program.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1993","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/251111/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1993","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4603902","pubMedId":"18218457","volume":"12","issue":"4","publicationDate":"Dec. 1993","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Segmentation of microcalcifications in mammograms","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Segmentation of microcalcifications in mammograms","sourcePdf":"00251111.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.039356S","chronDate":"Dec.  1993","isNumber":"6424","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"42","citationCount":"156","articleId":"251111","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":251114,"authors":[{"name":"J.

These algorithms are appealing because of their solid theoretical basis and their guaranteed convergence. A major drawback is the slow convergence, which results in-long processing times. The authors present 2 new heuristic acceleration methods for maximum likelihood reconstruction of ECT images. The first method incorporates a frequency-dependent amplification in the calculations, to compensate for the low pass filtering of the backprojection operation. In the second method, an amplification factor is incorporated that suppresses the effect of attenuation on the updating factors. Both methods are compared to the 1-dimensional line search method proposed by Lewitt. All 3 methods accelerate the ML algorithm. On the authors' test images, Lewitt's method produced the strongest acceleration of the three individual methods. However, the combination of the frequency amplification with the line search method results in a new algorithm with still better performance. Under certain conditions, an effective frequency amplification can be already achieved by skipping some of the calculations required for ML.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/42.251114","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/42.251114","startPage":"643","endPage":"652","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","pdfPath":"/iel1/42/6424/00251114.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6424","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Acceleration of maximum likelihood reconstruction, using frequency amplification and attenuation compensation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1993","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1993","displayDocTitle":"Acceleration of maximum likelihood reconstruction, using frequency amplification and attenuation compensation","publicationDate":"Dec. 1993","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","volume":"12","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4603903","pubMedId":"18218458","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/251114/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Acceleration of maximum likelihood reconstruction, using frequency amplification and attenuation compensation","sourcePdf":"00251114.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.088132S","chronDate":"Dec.  1993","isNumber":"6424","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"42","citationCount":"8","articleId":"251114","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":251117,"authors":[{"name":"G.

The prior information consists of significant anatomical boundaries that are likely to correspond to discontinuities in an otherwise spatially smooth radionuclide distribution. The authors' algorithm, like others proposed recently, seeks smooth solutions with occasional discontinuities; the contribution here is the inclusion of a coupling term that influences the creation of discontinuities in the vicinity of the significant anatomical boundaries. Simulations on anatomically derived mathematical phantoms are presented. Although computationally intense in its current implication, the reconstructions are improved (ROI-RMS error) relative to filtered backprojection and EM-ML reconstructions. The simulations show that the inclusion of position-dependent anatomical prior Information leads to further improvement relative to Bayesian reconstructions without the anatomical prior. The algorithm exhibits a certain degree of robustness with respect to errors in the location of anatomical boundaries.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/42.251117","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","pdfPath":"/iel1/42/6424/00251117.pdf","startPage":"670","endPage":"680","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/42.251117","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6424","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Bayesian reconstruction of functional images using anatomical information as priors","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=251117","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1993","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1993","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/251117/","displayDocTitle":"Bayesian reconstruction of functional images using anatomical information as priors","volume":"12","issue":"4","publicationDate":"Dec. 1993","accessionNumber":"4603906","pubMedId":"18218461","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Bayesian reconstruction of functional images using anatomical information as priors","sourcePdf":"00251117.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.033145S","chronDate":"Dec.  1993","isNumber":"6424","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"42","citationCount":"158","articleId":"251117","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":251122,"authors":[{"name":"M.

In order to increase the timing accuracy in beamforming, a computationally efficient interpolation scheme to increase the sampling rate is examined. For adaptive beamforming, a phase aberration correction method with very low computational complexity is described. Image quality performance of the method is examined by processing the non-aberrated and aberrated phased-array experimental data sets of an ultrasound resolution phantom. A digital beamforming scheme based on receive focusing at the raster focal points is examined. The sector images of the resolution phantom, reconstructed from the phased-array experimental data by beamforming at the radial and raster focal points, are presented for comparison of the image resolution performances of the two beamforming schemes.

The system consists of 2 components: an unsupervised clustering algorithm and an expert system. MR brain data is initially segmented by the unsupervised algorithm, then the expert system locates a landmark tissue or cluster and analyzes it by matching it with a model or searching in it for an expected feature. The landmark tissue location and its analysis are repeated until a tumor is found or all tissues are labeled. The knowledge base contains information on cluster distribution in feature space and tissue models. Since tissue shapes are irregular, their models and matching are specially designed: 1) qualitative tissue models are defined for brain tissues such as white matter; 2) default reasoning is used to match a model with an MR image; that is, if there is no mismatch between a model and an image, they are taken as matched. The system has been tested with 53 slices of MR images acquired at different times by 2 different scanners. It accurately identifies abnormal slices and provides a partial labeling of the tissues. It provides an accurate complete labeling of all normal tissues in the absence of large amounts of data nonuniformity, as verified by radiologists. Thus the system can be used to provide automatic screening of slices for abnormality. It also provides a first step toward the complete description of abnormal images for use in automatic tumor volume determination.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/42.251125","startPage":"740","endPage":"750","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","pdfPath":"/iel1/42/6424/00251125.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/42.251125","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6424","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Knowledge-based classification and tissue labeling of MR images of human brain","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Labeling","Brain modeling","Clustering algorithms","Expert systems","Neoplasms","Magnetic resonance","Humans","Image segmentation","Magnetic analysis","Algorithm design and analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biomedical NMR","brain","medical expert systems","medical image processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["knowledge-based classification","tissue labeling","human brain MR images","unsupervised clustering algorithm","cluster distribution","feature space","default reasoning","model-image mismatch","abnormal slices detection","automatic screening","automatic tumor volume determination","magnetic resonance imaging","medical diagnostic imaging"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/251125/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1993","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1993","displayDocTitle":"Knowledge-based classification and tissue labeling of MR images of human brain","volume":"12","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 1993","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4603914","pubMedId":"18218469","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Knowledge-based classification and tissue labeling of MR images of human brain","sourcePdf":"00251125.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.045424S","chronDate":"Dec.  1993","isNumber":"6424","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"42","citationCount":"115","articleId":"251125","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":251128,"authors":[{"name":"B.M.

However, the efficacy of these techniques is affected by acquisition artifacts such as inter-slice, intra-slice, and inter-patient intensity variations. Here a new approach to the correction of intra-slice intensity variations is presented. Results demonstrate that the correction process enhances the performance of backpropagation neural network classifiers designed for the segmentation of the images. Two slightly different versions of the method are presented. The first version fits an intensity correction surface directly to reference points selected by the user in the images. The second version fits the surface to reference points obtained by an intermediate classification operation. Qualitative and quantitative evaluation of both methods reveals that the first one leads to a better correction of the images than the second but that it is more sensitive to operator errors.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/42.251128","startPage":"770","endPage":"781","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/42.251128","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6424","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","pdfPath":"/iel1/42/6424/00251128.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Correction of intensity variations in MR images for computer-aided tissue classification","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/251128/","displayDocTitle":"Correction of intensity variations in MR images for computer-aided tissue classification","volume":"12","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4603918","pubMedId":"18218473","publicationDate":"Dec. 1993","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1993","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1993","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Correction of intensity variations in MR images for computer-aided tissue classification","sourcePdf":"00251128.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.057356S","chronDate":"Dec.  1993","isNumber":"6424","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"42","citationCount":"215","articleId":"251128","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":251132,"authors":[{"name":"J.D.

Although the DCT is the optimum fast transform for video compression applications, the authors show here that it is outperformed by the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) and discrete Hartley transform (DHT) for images obtained using positron emission tomography (PET) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and possibly for certain types of digitized radiographs. This difference occurs because PET and MRI images are characterized by a roughly circular region D of non-zero intensity bounded by a region R in which the image intensity is essentially zero. Clipping R to its minimum extent can reduce the number of low-intensity pixels but the practical requirement that images be stored on a rectangular grid means that a significant region of zero intensity must remain an integral part of the image to be compressed. With this constraint imposed, the DCT loses its advantage over the DFT because neither transform introduces significant artificial discontinuities. The DFT and DHT have the further important advantage of requiring less computation time than the DCT.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","pdfPath":"/iel1/42/6424/00251132.pdf","startPage":"803","endPage":"811","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","doi":"10.1109/42.251132","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/42.251132","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6424","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=251132","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Alternatives to the discrete cosine transform for irreversible tomographic image compression","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Discrete cosine transforms","Discrete Fourier transforms","Positron emission tomography","Magnetic resonance imaging","Image coding","Fast Fourier transforms","Biomedical imaging","Video compression","Radiography","Pixel"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biomedical NMR","computerised tomography","data compression","diagnostic radiography","discrete cosine transforms","Fourier transforms","medical image processing","radioisotope scanning and imaging"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["discrete cosine transform","irreversible tomographic image compression","video compression","discrete Fourier transform","discrete Hartley transform","positron emission tomography","magnetic resonance imaging","digitized radiographs","low-intensity pixels","computation time","medical diagnostic imaging"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/251132/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1993","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1993","displayDocTitle":"Alternatives to the discrete cosine transform for irreversible tomographic image compression","volume":"12","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 1993","accessionNumber":"4603921","pubMedId":"18218476","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Alternatives to the discrete cosine transform for irreversible tomographic image compression","sourcePdf":"00251132.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.056264S","chronDate":"Dec.  1993","isNumber":"6424","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"42","citationCount":"29","articleId":"251132","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":251134,"authors":[{"name":"Jian-yu Lu","affiliation":["Department of Physiology and Biophysics, Biodynamics Research Unit, Mayo Clinic and Foundation, Rochester, MN, USA"],"lastName":"Jian-yu Lu","id":"37087265619"},{"name":"T.K.

Because the routing switches consume significant chip area and introduce propagation delays, the design of the routing architecture greatly influences both the area utilization and speed performance of an FPGA. FPGA routing architectures have already been studied using experimental techniques. This paper describes a stochastic model that facilitates exploration of a wide range of FPGA routing architectures using a theoretical approach. In the stochastic model an FPGA is represented as an N*N array of logic blocks separated by both horizontal and vertical routing channels, similar to a Xilinx FPGA. A circuit to be routed is represented by additional parameters that specify the total number of connections, and each connection's length and trajectory. The stochastic model gives an analytic expression for the routability of the circuit in the FPGA. Practically speaking, routability can be viewed as the likelihood that a circuit can be successfully routed in a given FPGA. The routability predictions from the model are validated by comparing them with the results of a previously published experimental study on FPGA routability.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00251146.png","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel1/43/6425/00251146.pdf","startPage":"1827","endPage":"1838","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","doi":"10.1109/43.251146","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/43.251146","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6425","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=251146","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A stochastic model to predict the routability of field-programmable gate arrays","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Stochastic processes","Predictive models","Field programmable gate arrays","Routing","Architecture","Switches","Logic arrays","Wires","Integrated circuit interconnections","Logic design"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["circuit layout CAD","logic arrays","logic CAD","network routing","VLSI"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["stochastic model","routability","field-programmable gate arrays","routing architecture","user-programmable switches","logic resources","chip area","propagation delays","speed performance","routing channels","logic design"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/251146/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1993","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1993","displayDocTitle":"A stochastic model to predict the routability of field-programmable gate arrays","volume":"12","issue":"12","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 1993","accessionNumber":"4608768","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A stochastic model to predict the routability of field-programmable gate arrays","sourcePdf":"00251146.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.041985S","chronDate":"Dec 1993","isNumber":"6425","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","citationCount":"38","articleId":"251146","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":251149,"authors":[{"name":"G.K.-H.

Time complexity of the algorithm is analyzed and experimental results using MCNC benchmarks are reported.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/43.251149","startPage":"1858","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel1/43/6425/00251149.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/43.251149","endPage":"1867","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6425","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A unified approach to floorplan sizing and enumeration","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/251149/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1993","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1993","displayDocTitle":"A unified approach to floorplan sizing and enumeration","volume":"12","issue":"12","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4608771","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Dec. 1993","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A unified approach to floorplan sizing and enumeration","sourcePdf":"00251149.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.044381S","chronDate":"Dec 1993","isNumber":"6425","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","citationCount":"10","articleId":"251149","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":251150,"authors":[{"name":"P.

A transition fault model for sequential circuits is first proposed. In this fault model, a transition fault is characterized by the fault site, the fault type, and the fault size. The fault type is either slow-to-rise or slow-to-fall. The fault size is specified in units of clock cycles. Fault simulation and test generation algorithms for this fault model are presented. The fault simulation algorithm is a modification of PROOFS, a parallel, differential fault simulation algorithm for stuck faults. Experimental results show that neither a comprehensive functional verification sequence nor a test sequence generated by a sequential circuit test generator for stuck faults produces a high fault coverage for transition faults. Deterministic test generation for transition faults is required to raise the coverage to a reasonable level. With the use of a novel fault injection technique, tests for transition faults can be generated by using a stuck fault test generation algorithm with some modifications. Experimental results for ISCAS-89 benchmark circuits and some AT&T designs are presented. Modifications to test generation and fault simulation algorithms required for partial scan circuits are presented. Experimental results on large benchmark circuits show that a high transition fault coverage can be achieved for the partial scan circuits designed using the cycle breaking technique.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel1/43/6425/00251160.pdf","startPage":"1971","endPage":"1983","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","doi":"10.1109/43.251160","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/43.251160","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6425","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=251160","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Transition fault testing for sequential circuits","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Circuit testing","Circuit faults","Sequential analysis","Sequential circuits","Delay","Semiconductor device modeling","Circuit simulation","Clocks","Benchmark testing","Fault detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["automatic testing","digital simulation","fault location","logic testing","sequential circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["transition faults","partial scan synchronous sequential circuits","nonscan synchronous sequential circuits","fault site","fault type","fault size","clock cycles","test generation algorithms","PROOFS","differential fault simulation algorithm","stuck faults","fault coverage","fault injection technique","ISCAS-89 benchmark circuits","fault simulation algorithms","cycle breaking technique"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/251160/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1993","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1993","displayDocTitle":"Transition fault testing for sequential circuits","volume":"12","issue":"12","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 1993","accessionNumber":"4608782","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Transition fault testing for sequential circuits","sourcePdf":"00251160.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.03529S","chronDate":"Dec 1993","isNumber":"6425","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","citationCount":"79","articleId":"251160","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":251167,"authors":[{"name":"D.A.

It is shown that recently observed large optical fluctuations resulting from SBS degrade the signal-to-noise ratio and consequently the system bit error rate. Since SBS has potentially the lowest power threshold of all fiber nonlinearities: it is critical that it be addressed. It is shown that the SBS threshold can be increased by providing a low frequency sine wave dither to the laser pre-bias current. It is found that a modulation index as low as 2% can quadruple the SBS threshold. Measurements with a 1.5- mu m externally modulated laser at 2.5 Gb/s indicate that this dither in no way degrades the performance in the presence of chromatic dispersion.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Degradation","Brillouin scattering","Optical fibers","Fiber nonlinear optics","Nonlinear optics","Stimulated emission","Optical scattering","Fluctuations","Signal to noise ratio","Bit error rate"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fluctuations","optical fibres","optical links","optical modulation","refractive index","stimulated Brillouin scattering"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["stimulated Brillouin scattering","multigigabit intensity-modulated fiber-optic systems","SBS","maximum power","low-loss optical fibers","large optical fluctuations","SBS degrade","signal-to-noise ratio","system bit error rate","power threshold","fiber nonlinearities","low frequency sine wave dither","laser pre-bias current","modulation index","chromatic dispersion","2.5 Gbit/s","1.5 mum"]}],"doi":"10.1109/50.251167","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel1/50/6426/00251167.pdf","startPage":"1721","endPage":"1728","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6426","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/50.251167","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Degradations due to stimulated Brillouin scattering in multigigabit intensity-modulated fiber-optic systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=251167","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Degradations due to stimulated Brillouin scattering in multigigabit intensity-modulated fiber-optic systems","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/251167/","volume":"11","issue":"11","publicationDate":"Nov. 1993","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4660193","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1993","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1993","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Degradations due to stimulated Brillouin scattering in multigigabit intensity-modulated fiber-optic systems","sourcePdf":"00251167.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.034739S","chronDate":"Nov 1993","isNumber":"6426","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"78","articleId":"251167","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":251169,"authors":[{"name":"M.K.

We investigate experimentally and theoretically two mechanisms for this distortion: for chirped sources, PMD in the presence of polarization-mode coupling results in second-order distortion that is proportional to the square of the modulation frequency; when polarization-dependent loss is present, an additional second-order distortion term occurs that is independent of modulation frequency. Both mechanisms give rise to distortion that is time varying due to the sensitivity of PMD to ambient temperature changes. Numerical examples indicate that these effects can limit the capacity of analog systems that use directly modulated semiconductor lasers.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/251171/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1993","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1993","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"11","issue":"11","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 1993","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4660197","displayDocTitle":"Distortion related to polarization-mode dispersion in analog lightwave systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distortion related to polarization-mode dispersion in analog lightwave systems","sourcePdf":"00251171.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.033401S","chronDate":"Nov 1993","isNumber":"6426","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"48","articleId":"251171","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":251185,"authors":[{"name":"R.

The number of stations that can be supported with and without amplifiers in a single folded bus, a double bus, and a star is determined. For a typical case, when only one station on the bus is allowed to transmit at a time, as is the case in a time-division multiplexed network, the number of stations that can be supported with amplifiers is on the order of several thousands. This number drops to less than a thousand when all stations are allowed to transmit simultaneously on different channels in a wavelength-division multiplexed network, because of amplifier gain saturation. In the former case, the bus has the potential to outperform the star, but in the latter case, the star topology is still better.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optical fiber networks","Intelligent networks","Stimulated emission","Optical saturation","Network topology","Optical transmitters","Erbium-doped fiber amplifier","Optical amplifiers","Optical receivers","Optical attenuators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["erbium","fibre lasers","optical communication equipment","optical links","time division multiplexing","wavelength division multiplexing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["effective power budget","optical bus networks","star networks","erbium-doped fiber amplifiers","EDFA","number of stations","single folded bus","double bus","time-division multiplexed network","wavelength-division multiplexed network","amplifier gain saturation","star topology","Er doped fibre amplifier"]}],"doi":"10.1109/50.251185","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel1/50/6426/00251185.pdf","startPage":"1863","endPage":"1871","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6426","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/50.251185","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis of effective power budget in optical bus and star networks using erbium-doped fiber amplifiers","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=251185","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Analysis of effective power budget in optical bus and star networks using erbium-doped fiber amplifiers","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/251185/","volume":"11","issue":"11","publicationDate":"Nov. 1993","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4660211","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1993","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1993","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis of effective power budget in optical bus and star networks using erbium-doped fiber amplifiers","sourcePdf":"00251185.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.036S","chronDate":"Nov 1993","isNumber":"6426","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"13","articleId":"251185","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":251186,"authors":[{"name":"R.J.

These blocked elements produce undesired beamforming artifacts, degrading spatial and contrast resolution. To minimize these artifacts, an algorithm using multiple receive beams and the total-least-squares method is proposed. Simulations and experimental results show that this algorithm can effectively reduce imperfections in the point spread function of the imager. Combined with first-and second-order scatterer statistics derived from multiple receive beams, the algorithm is modified for blocked element compensation on distributed scattering sources. Results also indicate that compensated images are comparable to full array images, and that even full array images can be improved by removing undesired sidelobe contributions. This method, therefore, can enhance detection of low contrast lesions using large phased-array apertures.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/58.251276","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","pdfPath":"/iel1/58/6428/00251276.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6428","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/58.251276","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","startPage":"283","endPage":"292","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Blocked element compensation in phased array imaging","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=251276","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  1993","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"July  1993","displayDocTitle":"Blocked element compensation in phased array imaging","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/251276/","volume":"40","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"July 1993","accessionNumber":"4506176","pubMedId":"18263183","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Blocked element compensation in phased array imaging","sourcePdf":"00251276.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.045776S","chronDate":"July  1993","isNumber":"6428","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"58","citationCount":"40","articleId":"251276","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":251312,"authors":[{"name":"Wenyan Zhang","affiliation":["ABB Power Systems and Royal Institute of Technology, Sweden"],"lastName":"Wenyan Zhang","id":"37383684100"},{"name":"G.

The existence of UI (user interface) standards has given impetus to independent application specialists to develop products in their chosen area of expertise; the standards have, in effect, created a market for third-party software.

It is found that the performance of the FD-TD technique is greatly enhanced when used to simulate microwave passive circuits. The results of this study show that for the analysis of typical high-Q circuits, CPU-time savings of up to 90% can be realized by combining AR model and FD-TD. After testing a number of different 50-ohm microstrip lines, the authors conclude that DBC shows good performance and gives excellent results when implemented with FD-TD, if the parameters are chosen properly. The use of this boundary condition can result in a considerable improvement in the accuracy of FD-TD simulations. These results help to demonstrate the usefulness of incorporating both the DBC and AR model with the FD-TD algorithm when analyzing practical microwave circuits.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Some considerations for using the finite difference time domain technique to analyze microwave integrated circuits","publicationTitle":"IEEE Microwave and Guided Wave Letters","doi":"10.1109/75.251395","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Microwave and Guided Wave Letters","pdfPath":"/iel4/75/6432/00251395.pdf","startPage":"438","endPage":"440","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/75.251395","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6432","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=251395","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/251395/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1993","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1993","displayDocTitle":"Some considerations for using the finite difference time domain technique to analyze microwave integrated circuits","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"3","issue":"12","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Dec. 1993","accessionNumber":"4611243","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Some considerations for using the finite difference time domain technique to analyze microwave integrated circuits","sourcePdf":"00251395.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.050478S","chronDate":"Dec.  1993","isNumber":"6432","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"75","citationCount":"12","articleId":"251395","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":251398,"authors":[{"name":"P.M.

A brief review of the overall architecture which consists of a coarse section and an interpolator section is given. Experiments on two designs for the coarse sections are discussed. One is a 6-bit A/D converter built with two-leaf phase tree periodic comparators. Asynchronous beat frequency tests at 2.01 GHz sampling rates indicate this circuit is capable of 6 bits of resolution at 2 GHz input bandwidth. The resolution falls off to about 5 bits at 4 GHz and 4 bits at 6 GHz. The other approach involves two related novel single threshold comparators with large dynamic range. For one of the comparators, dynamic range in excess of 60 db is demonstrated by transfer characteristic and input current noise measurements, while the other showed 54 db of dynamic range. A chain of 15 comparators based on one of the designs has been designed and tested. Asynchronous beat frequency tests at 2.01 GHz sampling rates show a monotonic response for input frequencies up to 8 GHz. Threshold offsets due to flux trapping limited the resolution in this set of experiments to about 5 bits. Experiments on a periodic interpolator circuit based on the two-leaf phase tree comparator are also presented. The results suggest that it should be possible to obtain 10-bits of resolution with this approach.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/251808/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1993","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1993","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Dec. 1993","accessionNumber":"4616800","volume":"3","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Design and experiments on a high-resolution multi-gigahertz sampling rate superconducting A/D converter","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design and experiments on a high-resolution multi-gigahertz sampling rate superconducting A/D converter","sourcePdf":"00251808.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.032649S","chronDate":"Dec.  1993","isNumber":"6433","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"77","citationCount":"3","articleId":"251808","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":251818,"authors":[{"name":"T.

The authors apply Melnikov's method to high-damping PLLs to obtain the parameter range where there exist homoclinic points. This implies the PLL is chaotic in such a parameter range in view of the Smale-Birkhoff theorem. In particular, since the current PLL used in practice has a triangular phase detector as its nonlinearity (i.e., a periodic triangular shaped function), one can use piecewise-linear methods to derive the Melnikov integral analytically even for the practical high-damping (hence, high dissipation) case. The advantage of this method compared to the previous numerical integration method is that all integrations are made analytically, and therefore reliable results can be obtained for all parameter values. The authors have obtained many boundary curves for homoclinic tangency for a wide range of damping coefficients. As a result, some inaccuracies in previous numerical integration results have been detected.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/81.251818","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/81.251818","startPage":"801","endPage":"807","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Fundamental Theory and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel4/81/6434/00251818.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Fundamental Theory and Applications","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6434","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Piecewise-linear analysis of high-damping chaotic phase-locked loops using Melnikov's method","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1993","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1993","displayDocTitle":"Piecewise-linear analysis of high-damping chaotic phase-locked loops using Melnikov's method","publicationDate":"Nov. 1993","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","volume":"40","issue":"11","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4611253","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/251818/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Piecewise-linear analysis of high-damping chaotic phase-locked loops using Melnikov's method","sourcePdf":"00251818.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.030248S","chronDate":"Nov 1993","isNumber":"6434","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"81","citationCount":"8","articleId":"251818","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":251825,"authors":[{"name":"F.

These circuits are described by a system of differential equation associated with a piecewise linear continuous vector-field in the n-dimensional state-space, which consists of two different linear regions. The circuits contain only two-terminal elements, one piecewise linear resistor and a number of linear resistors, capacitors and inductors. The developed method leads to a variety of structures. It is possible to design n-dimensional canonical circuits containing a minimum number of inductors as well as inductor-free circuits. A surprising result is the transformation of the 3-D Chua circuit into an inductor-free circuit that exhibits the double scroll as well. Using our approach, a theorem that specifies the restriction of eigenvalue patterns associated with a piecewise linear vector-field having at least two equilibrium points can be proved.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/81.251827","startPage":"854","endPage":"860","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Fundamental Theory and Applications","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/81.251827","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6434","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Fundamental Theory and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel4/81/6434/00251827.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Synthesis of higher dimensional Chua circuits","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/251827/","displayDocTitle":"Synthesis of higher dimensional Chua circuits","volume":"40","issue":"11","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4611262","publicationDate":"Nov. 1993","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1993","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1993","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Synthesis of higher dimensional Chua circuits","sourcePdf":"00251827.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.038291S","chronDate":"Nov 1993","isNumber":"6434","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"81","citationCount":"27","articleId":"251827","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":251828,"authors":[{"name":"A.

It is illustrated in this paper that by modifying the characteristic of the nonlinear resistor with additional break points even more \"complicated\" attractors can be obtained, called n-double scrolls (n=1, 2, 3, 4,...). The new circuit can be seen as a generalization of Chua's circuit such that the 1-double scroll corresponds to the classical double scroll. The construction of the attractors was partially based on a combination of linearization around equilibrium points and an alternative method for studying nonlinear systems that we called a quasilinear approach. This method is heuristic and qualitative but may give additional global insight into the state space behaviour and may open new views towards the construction of attractors.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/81.251829","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00251829.png","startPage":"861","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Fundamental Theory and Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Fundamental Theory and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel4/81/6434/00251829.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/81.251829","endPage":"867","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6434","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Generation of n-double scrolls (n=1, 2, 3, 4,...)","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/251829/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1993","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1993","displayDocTitle":"Generation of n-double scrolls (n=1, 2, 3, 4,...)","volume":"40","issue":"11","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4611263","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Nov. 1993","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Generation of n-double scrolls (n=1, 2, 3, 4,...)","sourcePdf":"00251829.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.039579S","chronDate":"Nov 1993","isNumber":"6434","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"81","citationCount":"241","articleId":"251829","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":251840,"authors":[{"name":"C.

The gateway detects incipient congestion by computing the average queue size. The gateway could notify connections of congestion either by dropping packets arriving at the gateway or by setting a bit in packet headers. When the average queue size exceeds a present threshold, the gateway drops or marks each arriving packet with a certain probability, where the exact probability is a function of the average queue size. RED gateways keep the average queue size low while allowing occasional bursts of packets in the queue. During congestion, the probability that the gateway notifies a particular connection to reduce its window is roughly proportional to that connection's share of the bandwidth through the gateway. RED gateways are designed to accompany a transport-layer congestion control protocol such as TCP. The RED gateway has no bias against bursty traffic and avoids the global synchronization of many connections decreasing their window at the same time. Simulations of a TCP/IP network are used to illustrate the performance of RED gateways.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/90.251892","publicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking","pdfPath":"/iel4/90/6438/00251892.pdf","startPage":"397","endPage":"413","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/90.251892","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6438","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Random early detection gateways for congestion avoidance","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=251892","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1993","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1993","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/251892/","displayDocTitle":"Random early detection gateways for congestion avoidance","volume":"1","issue":"4","publicationDate":"Aug. 1993","accessionNumber":"4583757","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Random early detection gateways for congestion avoidance","sourcePdf":"00251892.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.03216S","chronDate":"Aug 1993","isNumber":"6438","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"90","citationCount":"3949","articleId":"251892","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-30"},{"_id":251894,"authors":[{"name":"G.

More precisely, it is shown that when such sources share a buffer with deterministic service rate, a constraint on the tail of the buffer occupancy distribution is a linear constraint on the number of sources. That is, for a small loss probability one can assume that each source transmits at a fixed rate called its effective bandwidth. When traffic parameters are known, effective bandwidths can be calculated and may be used to obtain a circuit-switched style call acceptance and routing algorithm for ATM networks. The important feature of the effective bandwidth of a source is that it is a characteristic of that source and the acceptable loss probability only. Thus, the effective bandwidth of a source does not depend on the number of sources sharing the buffer or the model parameters of other types of sources sharing the buffer.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking","pdfPath":"/iel4/90/6438/00251894.pdf","startPage":"424","endPage":"428","publicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking","doi":"10.1109/90.251894","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/90.251894","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6438","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=251894","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Effective bandwidths for multiclass Markov fluids and other ATM sources","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Bandwidth","Traffic control","Probability distribution","Propagation losses","Telecommunication traffic","Circuits","Routing","Steady-state"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["asynchronous transfer mode","Markov processes","probability","telecommunication traffic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ATM sources","call acceptance","call routing algorithm","effective bandwidths","multiclass Markov fluids","ATM traffic","deterministic service rate","buffer occupancy distribution","loss probability","traffic parameters","ATM networks"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/251894/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1993","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1993","displayDocTitle":"Effective bandwidths for multiclass Markov fluids and other ATM sources","volume":"1","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 1993","accessionNumber":"4583759","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Effective bandwidths for multiclass Markov fluids and other ATM sources","sourcePdf":"00251894.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.031474S","chronDate":"Aug 1993","isNumber":"6438","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"90","citationCount":"381","articleId":"251894","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":251895,"authors":[{"name":"C.

Traffic smoothing on a frame-by-frame basis allows a quasistatic approximation that accurately predicts results such as buffer occupancy distributions and cell loss rates to be made. Convolving individual source histograms allow prediction of the queueing performance of a multiplexed stream. The approximation is investigated in more detail by modeling video as a Markov modulated Poisson process. It is shown that the multiplexer system is nearly completely decomposable (NCD). NCD systems have a well-known approximate solution, which is identical to the histogram approximation. Error bounds for the NCD approximation are also known and are reasonably tight. Results indicate that while the presence of strong correlations is an important characteristic of video traffic, the actual form of that correlation is not.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A histogram-based model for video traffic behavior in an ATM multiplexer","publicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking","doi":"10.1109/90.251897","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking","pdfPath":"/iel4/90/6438/00251897.pdf","startPage":"446","endPage":"459","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/90.251897","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6438","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=251897","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/251897/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1993","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1993","displayDocTitle":"A histogram-based model for video traffic behavior in an ATM multiplexer","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"1","issue":"4","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Aug. 1993","accessionNumber":"4583762","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A histogram-based model for video traffic behavior in an ATM multiplexer","sourcePdf":"00251897.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.060589S","chronDate":"Aug 1993","isNumber":"6438","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"90","citationCount":"137","articleId":"251897","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":251899,"authors":[{"name":"I.

For a two-node multiple links system, uniqueness of the Nash equilibrium is proven under reasonable convexity conditions. It is shown that this Nash equilibrium point possesses interesting monotonicity properties. For general networks, these convexity conditions are not sufficient for guaranteeing uniqueness, and a counterexample is presented. Nonetheless, uniqueness of the Nash equilibrium for general topologies is established under various assumptions.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","publicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking","pdfPath":"/iel4/90/6439/00251910.pdf","startPage":"510","endPage":"521","doi":"10.1109/90.251910","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/90.251910","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6439","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Competitive routing in multiuser communication networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/251910/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1993","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1993","displayDocTitle":"Competitive routing in multiuser communication networks","publicationDate":"Oct. 1993","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4606629","isJournal":true,"volume":"1","issue":"5","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Competitive routing in multiuser communication networks","sourcePdf":"00251910.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.037002S","chronDate":"Oct 1993","isNumber":"6439","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"90","citationCount":"331","articleId":"251910","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":251914,"authors":[{"name":"C.A.

This organization is motivated by performance and security concerns. However, considerations of code maintenance, ease of debugging, customization, and the simultaneous existence of multiple protocols argue for separating the implementations into more manageable user-level libraries of protocols. The present paper describes the design and implementation of transport protocols as user-level libraries. The authors begin by motivating the need for protocol implementations as user-level libraries and placing their approach in the context of previous work. They then describe their alternative to monolithic protocol organization, which has been implemented on Mach workstations connected not only to traditional Ethernet, but also to a more modern network, the DEC SRC AN1. Based on the authors' experience, they discuss the implications for host-network interface design and for overall system structure to support efficient user-level implementations of network protocols.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/90.251914","doi":"10.1109/90.251914","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking","pdfPath":"/iel4/90/6439/00251914.pdf","startPage":"554","endPage":"565","publicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6439","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Implementing network protocols at user level","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Implementing network protocols at user level","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/251914/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1993","isJournal":true,"volume":"1","issue":"5","publicationDate":"Oct. 1993","accessionNumber":"4606633","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1993","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Implementing network protocols at user level","sourcePdf":"00251914.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.039372S","chronDate":"Oct 1993","isNumber":"6439","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"90","citationCount":"48","articleId":"251914","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":251926,"authors":[{"name":"W.

The generic topologies of the neurons emerging there are significantly influenced by basic logic operators(AND, OR, NOT) encountered in the theory of fuzzy sets. The logical flavor of the proposed constructs is expressed in terms of operators used in their formalization and a way of their superposition in the neurons. The two broad categories of neurons embrace basic aggregation neurons (named AND and OR neurons) and referential processing units (such as matching, dominance, inclusion neurons). The specific features of the neurons are flexibly modeled with the aid of triangular norms. The inhibitory and excitatory characteristics are captured by embodying direct and complemented (negated) input signals. We will propose various topologies of neural networks put together with the use of these neurons and demonstrate straightforward relationships coming off between the problem specificity and the resulting architecture of the network. This limpid way of mapping the domain knowledge onto the structure of the network contributes significantly toward enhancements in learning processes in the network and substantially facilitates its interpretation.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neurons","Fuzzy sets","Neural networks","Computer networks","Network topology","Knowledge representation","Brazil Council","Biological system modeling","Computational modeling","Fuzzy logic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fuzzy set theory","knowledge based systems","learning (artificial intelligence)","network topology","neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fuzzy-set based models","neurons","knowledge-based networks","generic topologies","logic operators","aggregation neurons","referential processing units","matching","dominance","inclusion neurons","triangular norms","inhibitory characteristics","excitatory characteristics","neural networks","domain knowledge","learning processes"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6440","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/91.251926","startPage":"254","endPage":"266","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems","pdfPath":"/iel4/91/6440/00251926.pdf","doi":"10.1109/91.251926","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fuzzy-set based models of neurons and knowledge-based networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1993","displayDocTitle":"Fuzzy-set based models of neurons and knowledge-based networks","accessionNumber":"4601429","publicationDate":"Nov. 1993","volume":"1","issue":"4","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/251926/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1993","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fuzzy-set based models of neurons and knowledge-based networks","sourcePdf":"00251926.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.034392S","chronDate":"Nov 1993","isNumber":"6440","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"91","citationCount":"123","articleId":"251926","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":251928,"authors":[{"name":"J.

In particular, by drawing some equivalence between a simplified fuzzy control algorithm (SFCA) and a RBF network, we conclude that the RBF network can be interpreted in the context of fuzzy systems and can be naturally fuzzified into a class of more general networks, referred to as FBFN, with a variety of basis functions (not necessarily globally radial) synthesized from each dimension by fuzzy logical operators. On the other hand, as a result of natural generalization from RBF to SFCA, we claim that the fuzzy system like RBF is capable of universal approximation. Next, the FBFN is used as a multivariable rule-based controller but with an assumption that no rule-base exists, leading to a challenging problem of how to construct such a rule-base directly from the control environment. We propose a simple and systematic approach to performing this task by using a fuzzified competitive self-organizing scheme and incorporating an iterative learning control algorithm into the system. We have applied the approach to a problem of multivariable blood pressure control with a FBFN-based controller having six inputs and two outputs, representing a complicated control structure.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/91.251928","pdfPath":"/iel4/91/6440/00251928.pdf","startPage":"280","endPage":"287","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/91.251928","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6440","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Learning control using fuzzified self-organizing radial basis function network","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/251928/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1993","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1993","displayDocTitle":"Learning control using fuzzified self-organizing radial basis function network","volume":"1","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4601431","publicationDate":"Nov. 1993","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Learning control using fuzzified self-organizing radial basis function network","sourcePdf":"00251928.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.064217S","chronDate":"Nov 1993","isNumber":"6440","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"91","citationCount":"103","articleId":"251928","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":251930,"authors":[{"name":"Jihong Lee","affiliation":["Department of Control Engineering, Kumoh National Institute of Technology, Kumi, South Korea"],"lastName":"Jihong Lee","id":"37087173719"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6706"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0034"}],"articleNumber":"251930","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":143,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":871},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computational Intelligence Society","url":"http://ieee-cis.org/"}],"abstract":"To improve limitations of fuzzy PI controller especially when applied to high order systems, we propose two types of fuzzy logic controllers that take out appropriate amounts of accumulated control input according to fuzzily described situations in addition to the incremental control input calculated by conventional fuzzy PI controllers. The structures of the proposed controller were motivated by the problems of fuzzy PI controllers that they generally give inevitable overshoot when one tries to reduce rise time of response especially when a system of order higher than one is under consideration. Since the undesirable characteristics of the fuzzy PI controller are caused by integrating operation of the controller, even though the integrator itself is introduced to to overcome steady state error in response, we propose two fuzzy controllers that fuzzily clear out integrated quantities according to situation. The first controller determines the fuzzy resetting rate by situations described fuzzily by error and error rate, and the second one by error and control input. The two structures both give reduced rise time as well as small overshoot.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fuzzy logic","Control systems","Fuzzy control","Error correction","Fuzzy systems","Velocity control","Sliding mode control","Error analysis","Steady-state","Gold"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["control system analysis","controllers","fuzzy control","transients","two-term control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fuzzy PI controller","incremental control input","overshoot","rise time","integrator","fuzzy resetting rate","error rate"]}],"doi":"10.1109/91.251930","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems","pdfPath":"/iel4/91/6440/00251930.pdf","startPage":"298","endPage":"301","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6440","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/91.251930","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On methods for improving performance of PI-type fuzzy logic controllers","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=251930","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"On methods for improving performance of PI-type fuzzy logic controllers","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/251930/","volume":"1","issue":"4","publicationDate":"Nov. 1993","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4601433","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1993","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1993","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On methods for improving performance of PI-type fuzzy logic controllers","sourcePdf":"00251930.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.022968S","chronDate":"Nov 1993","isNumber":"6440","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"91","citationCount":"143","articleId":"251930","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":251937,"authors":[{"name":"D.

In general, the results were most dramatic when testing with noise densities with very heavy tails, such as the Cauchy and Gaussian mixture cases.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-17 May 1991","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/251943/","accessionNumber":"4399109","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1991","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"14-17 May 1992","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Locally optimal detection of unknown signals in non-Gaussian Markov noise","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Locally optimal detection of unknown signals in non-Gaussian Markov noise","confLoc":"Monterey, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00251943.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061141S","chronDate":"14-17 May 1991","isNumber":"6441","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"647","citationCount":"9","articleId":"251943","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":251990,"authors":[{"name":"P.

Learning of this architecture has been quick and reliable; this size of layers presumably provides excellent redundancy. It has also been found that this size could be reduced to approximately 25 without major deterioration of classification.

It has averaged spectral features, dynamic spectral features, and averaged and dynamic features of power of the two-dimensional mel-log spectra in the analyzed interval. The neural network in this study is a three-layered feedforward neural network and learns automatically using a back-propagation algorithm. Dynamic spectral features, and averaged and dynamic features of power are used as the input of a neural network. The experimental results of speaker-dependent word recognition experiments for 100 Japanese city names uttered by nine speakers show that dynamic spectral features smoothed with respect to time are effective, and a recognition accuracy of 99.1% was obtained.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/MWSCAS.1991.252106","startPage":"533","endPage":"536 vol.1","displayPublicationTitle":"[1991] Proceedings of the 34th Midwest Symposium on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel2/647/6441/00252106.pdf","publicationTitle":"[1991] Proceedings of the 34th Midwest Symposium on Circuits and Systems","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MWSCAS.1991.252106","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6441","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Speaker-dependent 100 word recognition using dynamic spectral features of speech and neural networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Speech recognition","Neural networks","Fourier transforms","Feedforward neural networks","Cities and towns","Speaker recognition","Frequency domain analysis","Time domain analysis","Vocabulary","Discrete Fourier transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["backpropagation","feedforward neural nets","learning systems","speech recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["100 word recognition","dynamic spectral features","speech","neural networks","spoken word recognition method","two-dimensional mel-cepstrum","two-dimensional Fourier transform","mel-frequency scaled log spectra","averaged spectral features","three-layered feedforward neural network","back-propagation algorithm","speaker-dependent word recognition","Japanese"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/252106/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-17 May 1991","displayDocTitle":"Speaker-dependent 100 word recognition using dynamic spectral features of speech and neural networks","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1991","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"14-17 May 1992","accessionNumber":"4386549","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Speaker-dependent 100 word recognition using dynamic spectral features of speech and neural networks","confLoc":"Monterey, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00252106.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.028647S","chronDate":"14-17 May 1991","isNumber":"6441","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"647","articleId":"252106","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":252129,"authors":[{"name":"M.S.

The circuit realizes inductance by impedance gyration using a CC-CE pair, with the parasitic capacitance between the base and emitter of the CE transistor as the load. A feedback network consisting of two parallel RC networks in series is used to produce a flat inductance versus frequency response by compensating for the pi model elements of the transistors. Using the S-parameters of NEC NE57800 transistors (f tau approximately=6 GHz), an analysis of the proposed circuit predicted an inductance of 4+or-1 nH and a resistance of less than 14 Omega up to a frequency of 2.5 GHz. The resonant frequency of the circuit was computed to be about 3.45 GHz. An integrated version of this circuit could prove to be useful for monolithic microwave integrated circuits using BJTs.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Active inductors","Microwave circuits","Inductance","Scattering parameters","Microwave transistors","Circuit synthesis","Network synthesis","Bipolar transistor circuits","Impedance","Parasitic capacitance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feedback","inductors","MMIC","S-parameters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["broadband microwave BJT active inductor circuit","S-parameter analysis","impedance gyration","parasitic capacitance","feedback network","parallel RC networks","pi model elements","NEC NE57800","resonant frequency","monolithic microwave integrated circuits","2.5 GHz","3.45 GHz"]}],"doi":"10.1109/MWSCAS.1991.252183","publicationTitle":"[1991] Proceedings of the 34th Midwest Symposium on Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"[1991] Proceedings of the 34th Midwest Symposium on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel2/647/6441/00252183.pdf","startPage":"407","endPage":"409 vol.1","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6441","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MWSCAS.1991.252183","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design of a broadband microwave BJT active inductor circuit","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=252183","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Design of a broadband microwave BJT active inductor circuit","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/252183/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1991","accessionNumber":"4386517","conferenceDate":"14-17 May 1992","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-17 May 1991","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design of a broadband microwave BJT active inductor circuit","confLoc":"Monterey, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00252183.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.036347S","chronDate":"14-17 May 1991","isNumber":"6441","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"647","citationCount":"6","articleId":"252183","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":252185,"authors":[{"name":"C.

The authors perviously (1991, 1992) reported a technique which allows an an artificial neural network to quickly learn to steer by watching a person drive. But the faster the network is trained, the less exposure it receives to novel or infrequent scenarios. For instance, during a typical four minute training run, the network sees few if any examples of passing cars. When a rare situation like this occurs during testing, its lack of coverage in the training set canresult in erratic driving. By modeling the appearance of infrequent scenarios and then using the model to augment the training set, one can teach the network to generalize to situations not explicitly represented in the live training data. Using this technique, a network trained over a two mile stretch of highway was able to drive autonomously for 21.2 miles at speeds of up to 55 miles/hour.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/IVS.1992.252290","pdfPath":"/iel2/673/6442/00252290.pdf","startPage":"391","endPage":"396","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the Intelligent Vehicles `92 Symposium","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the Intelligent Vehicles `92 Symposium","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IVS.1992.252290","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6442","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Progress in neural network-based vision for autonomous robot driving","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/252290/","chronOrPublicationDate":"29 Jun-1 Jul 1992","displayDocTitle":"Progress in neural network-based vision for autonomous robot driving","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4494077","publicationDate":"1992","conferenceDate":"29 June-1 July 1992","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Progress in neural network-based vision for autonomous robot driving","confLoc":"Detroit, MI, USA","sourcePdf":"00252290.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.035919S","chronDate":"29 Jun-1 Jul 1992","isNumber":"6442","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"673","citationCount":"19","articleId":"252290","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":252521,"authors":[{"name":"P.

Inconsistencies found while measuring samples of different thicknesses were solved by abandoning the model of Levine and Papas for the probe and developing a new model. Using the spectral-domain technique, a closed-form expression is obtained for the admittance of a hanged open-ended coaxial line radiating into a planar-stratified material backed by a metal plate. This new expression can be considered as a correction to the model of Levine and Papas. The model considers the dominant mode as well as the effect of higher order modes. With this new model measurements of low dielectric constant materials were performed together with a perturbation analysis of the influence of air gaps.

The paper is focused on two points, the accurate demodulation of the difference of two sinewave signals and the common-mode correction of the measurement. The method is oriented for applications in measuring instruments, where a signal source (sinewave oscillator) is assumed to be incorporated. It uses a sample-and-hold circuit, suitably driven, as an amplitude demodulator. One of the advantages of this method is that the realization of the synchronous demodulator (or phase-sensitive detector) does not require a low-pass fitter at the output, resulting in a smaller settling time, that is, in higher speed of measurement.

The performance of the compensation approach is presented for four different nonmonotonic waveforms.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/19.252530","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/19.252530","startPage":"931","endPage":"935","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement","pdfPath":"/iel1/19/6447/00252530.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6447","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Compensation of Markov estimator errors in time-jittered sampling of nonmonotonic signals","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1993","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1993","displayDocTitle":"Compensation of Markov estimator errors in time-jittered sampling of nonmonotonic signals","publicationDate":"Oct. 1993","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","volume":"42","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4580527","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/252530/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Compensation of Markov estimator errors in time-jittered sampling of nonmonotonic signals","sourcePdf":"00252530.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.026342S","chronDate":"Oct 1993","isNumber":"6447","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"19","citationCount":"6","articleId":"252530","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":252539,"authors":[{"name":"T.K.

The heat capacity at 77 K is several orders of magnitude larger than at 4 K. This phenomenon increases conductor stability against flux jumps but makes switching from the superconducting to normal state slow and difficult.

The control strategy can be easily obtained on the basis of the system topology which is provided by ANNs. ANNs are designed in two groups. The first group estimates the proper load level from the load data of each zone. The second determines the appropriate system topology from the input load level. Several programs with the training set builder are developed for the design, the training, and the accuracy test of artificial neural networks. The performance of neural networks designed is evaluated on the test distribution system.

The continuous wavelet transform then provides an additional tool for studying and gaining insight into wideband correlation processing.

The focus is on range queries, as opposed to partial match queries that older declustering methods have examined. The method uses a distance-preserving mapping, the Hilbert curve, to impose a linear ordering on the multidimensional points (buckets); then, it traverses the buckets according to this ordering, assigning buckets to disks in a round-robin fashion. Because of the good distance-preserving properties of the Hilbert curve, the end result is that each disk contains buckets that are far away in the linear ordering, and, most probably, far away in the k-d address space. This is exactly the goal of declustering. Experiments show that these intuitive arguments lead to good performance: the proposed method performs at least as well as or better than older declustering schemes.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-22 Jan 1993","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/253077/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"4524033","conferenceDate":"20-22 Jan. 1993","publicationDate":"1993","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Declustering using fractals","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Declustering using fractals","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00253077.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042564S","chronDate":"20-22 Jan 1993","isNumber":"6455","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"450","citationCount":"69","articleId":"253077","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":253112,"authors":[{"name":"F.

A fully embedded code represents a sequence of binary decisions that distinguish an image from the 'null' image. Using an embedded coding algorithm, an encoder can terminate the encoding at any point thereby allowing a target rate or target distortion metric to be met exactly. Also, the decoder can cease decoding at any point in the bit stream and still produce exactly the same image that would have been encoded at the bit rate corresponding to the truncated bit stream. The algorithm consistently produces compression results that are competitive with virtually all known compression algorithms on standard test images, but requires absolutely no training, no pre-stored tables or codebooks, and no prior knowledge of the image source. It is based on four key concepts: (1) wavelet transform or hierarchical subband decomposition, (2) prediction of the absence of significant information across scales by exploiting the self-similarity inherent in images (3) entropy-coded successive-approximation quantization, and (4) universal lossless data compression achieved via adaptive arithmetic coding.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An embedded hierarchical image coder using zerotrees of wavelet coefficients","publicationTitle":"[Proceedings] DCC `93: Data Compression Conference","doi":"10.1109/DCC.1993.253128","displayPublicationTitle":"[Proceedings] DCC `93: Data Compression Conference","pdfPath":"/iel2/452/6456/00253128.pdf","startPage":"214","endPage":"223","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DCC.1993.253128","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6456","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=253128","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/253128/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1993","displayDocTitle":"An embedded hierarchical image coder using zerotrees of wavelet coefficients","conferenceDate":"30 March-2 April 1993","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1993","accessionNumber":"4529433","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An embedded hierarchical image coder using zerotrees of wavelet coefficients","confLoc":"Snowbird, UT, USA","sourcePdf":"00253128.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.023045S","chronDate":"1993","isNumber":"6456","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"452","citationCount":"56","articleId":"253128","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":253129,"authors":[{"name":"A.

There are some applications where destinations will join and leave the multicast group. Under these conditions, computing an 'optimal' spanning tree after each modification may not be the best way to proceed. An alternative is to make modest alterations to an existing spanning tree to derive a new one. An extreme, though nonoptimal, variation of this is to use minimal cost source to destination routing for each destination, effectively ignoring the existing multicast tree. The authors examine just how nonoptimal these trees are in random general topology networks and conclude that they are worse by only a small factor.

It is concluded that the best way of disseminating link-state information is through event-driven (ED) updating, and it is shown how to overcome the traditional drawbacks of ED updating. An efficient algorithm that extracts the maximum implicit information from ED topology updates by computing the latest time for which each processing node can be certain of the state of each network link is given. It is shown that the information obtained is equivalent to that obtained by continuous flooding of link-state information. A method that allows each node to refresh the above information continuously without running the algorithm more than once for each received update is presented, as is an approximate version of the algorithm that reduces communication overhead by limiting the radii of propagation.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=253265","publicationTitle":"IEEE INFOCOM '93 The Conference on Computer Communications, Proceedings","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE INFOCOM '93 The Conference on Computer Communications, Proceedings","pdfPath":"/iel2/457/6457/00253265.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6457","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INFCOM.1993.253265","startPage":"1004","endPage":"1013 vol.3","doi":"10.1109/INFCOM.1993.253265","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/253265/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1993","displayDocTitle":"How to extract maximum information from event-driven topology updates","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"28 March-1 April 1993","publicationDate":"1993","accessionNumber":"4524239","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"How to extract maximum information from event-driven topology updates","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00253265.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.026433S","chronDate":"1993","isNumber":"6457","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"457","citationCount":"1","articleId":"253265","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-10"},{"_id":253331,"authors":[{"name":"E.

The schemes proposed in the literature advocate a per-connection allocation wherein all the packets of a connection are constrained to follow the same path. The authors believe that a smaller allocation granularity permits a finer control to be exerted and would result in improved performance, especially in the presence of bursty traffic sources. A simple two-node network is used to compare the performance of both allocation schemes. An analytical model is developed to compute the resequencing delay distribution for the per-packet allocation. It is observed that as the burstiness of the arrival process increases, the per-packet allocation is able to accommodate bursts in a more graceful fashion, resulting in better performance. The per-packet allocation also permits a more equitable distribution of network resources than the per-connection.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/253345/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1993","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1993","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"28 March-1 April 1993","accessionNumber":"4524159","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Choice of allocation granularity in multipath source routing schemes","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Choice of allocation granularity in multipath source routing schemes","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00253345.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.037252S","chronDate":"1993","isNumber":"6457","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"457","citationCount":"55","articleId":"253345","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":253353,"authors":[{"name":"C.M.

The problem formulation is based on the methodology of multiple-service, multiple-resource (MSMR) modeling, and only those admission-control policies that yield a coordinate convex state space are considered. This restriction, in conjunction with reasonable modeling assumptions, results in a product-form stationary distribution for the system state. A recursive procedure to accelerate the evaluation of a large number of different admission-control policies and a descent-search method to minimize the number of policies that must be evaluated in searching for the optimal one are developed. Numerical examples indicate that performance can be improved by administering admission control, but the improvement is typically small unless different revenues or costs are associated with the various call types.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An approach to voice admission control in multihop wireless networks","publicationTitle":"IEEE INFOCOM '93 The Conference on Computer Communications, Proceedings","doi":"10.1109/INFCOM.1993.253353","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE INFOCOM '93 The Conference on Computer Communications, Proceedings","pdfPath":"/iel2/457/6457/00253353.pdf","startPage":"246","endPage":"255 vol.1","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INFCOM.1993.253353","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6457","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=253353","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/253353/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1993","displayDocTitle":"An approach to voice admission control in multihop wireless networks","conferenceDate":"28 March-1 April 1993","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1993","accessionNumber":"4524151","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An approach to voice admission control in multihop wireless networks","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00253353.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.02825S","chronDate":"1993","isNumber":"6457","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"457","citationCount":"15","articleId":"253353","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":253383,"authors":[{"name":"Z.

Therefore, the packets from higher power groups can transmit successfully with higher probability than those from lower power groups. This implies that packets with higher power levels have higher priority than those packets with lower power levels. The goal of this research is to analyze the performance of fiber-optic CDMA packet networks using code sequences with given orthogonality properties.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/INFCOM.1993.253400","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INFCOM.1993.253400","publicationTitle":"IEEE INFOCOM '93 The Conference on Computer Communications, Proceedings","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE INFOCOM '93 The Conference on Computer Communications, Proceedings","pdfPath":"/iel2/457/6457/00253400.pdf","startPage":"1359","endPage":"1366 vol.3","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6457","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multilevel priority scheme for fiber-optic code division multiple access (CDMA) packet networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/253400/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1993","displayDocTitle":"Multilevel priority scheme for fiber-optic code division multiple access (CDMA) packet networks","conferenceDate":"28 March-1 April 1993","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1993","accessionNumber":"4547279","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multilevel priority scheme for fiber-optic code division multiple access (CDMA) packet networks","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00253400.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041375S","chronDate":"1993","isNumber":"6457","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"457","citationCount":"2","articleId":"253400","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":253403,"authors":[{"name":"A.J.

Flux signals are approached commonly in a way of calculation while the speed is mostly obtained by direct measurement. In some cases, however, the elimination of speed sensors is quite necessary as they tend to reduce system reliability when working in hostile environments. The authors describe the use of an extended Luenberger observer (ELO) for this application, because the extended Kalman filter (EKF) may not be good enough for producing estimates which are fast enough to trace target transients. In this paper two ELOs which not only can estimate motor speed but also load torque and rotor flux are designed. Experimental results for a full-order ELO and an EKF are given. It evidently proves that the ELO behaves much better than the EKF in this practical experimental conditions.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6459","startPage":"179","endPage":"184","displayPublicationTitle":"1993 Sixth International Conference on Electrical Machines and Drives (Conf.

Over the last three decades, many parametric methods of spectral estimation have been proposed to circumvent the inherent disadvantages of the FFT, i.e. lengthy data records, windowing, and interpolation. In this paper, in addition to the DFT techniques, four of these parametric methods are investigated with a focus on their ability to resolve the speed information carrier component and estimate its frequency. The techniques tested in this work are the FFT, the Goertzel algorithm, the maximum entropy method, and autoregressive adaptive techniques using the least-mean square algorithm, the fast recursive least-square algorithm, and the Kalman filter algorithm. Detailed mathematics were omitted for reasons of space. Computer simulations were carried out to assess and compare the performances of the methods. Then, a digitized stator current from a test rig was used to extend the comparison.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","publicationTitle":"1993 Sixth International Conference on Electrical Machines and Drives (Conf.

This neural network, NICE (neurally inspired contact estimation), has been constructed to directly embody the major problem domain constraint of uniform contact velocity and heading. NICE networks are constructed, not trained, to estimate contact position and motion from angle-of-arrival (AOA) measurements. The major advantages of the NICE system over existing methods are execution speed, an assessment of solution sensitivity, and the potential for sensor fusion. This system offers a number of attractive features. Foremost, a bearing line constrains the locus of points where a contact might be at a given time. Furthermore, different AOA sensors merely produce different loci; all are equivalent and can be fused using the system. Intermittent data can be accommodated by configuring correlation neurons to ignore the missing data, and the geographical grid resolutions can be varied to adjust to the quality of the sensor readings. In addition, the neural network can be executed in a highly parallel manner, taking advantage of the state-of-the-art parallel hardware.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/NNSP.1992.253656","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00253656.png","startPage":"560","endPage":"569","displayPublicationTitle":"Neural Networks for Signal Processing II Proceedings of the 1992 IEEE Workshop","pdfPath":"/iel2/631/6460/00253656.pdf","publicationTitle":"Neural Networks for Signal Processing II Proceedings of the 1992 IEEE Workshop","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NNSP.1992.253656","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6460","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Constructing neural networks for contact tracking","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Sensor fusion","State estimation","Motion estimation","Motion measurement","Position measurement","Goniometers","Sensor systems","Neurons","Neural network hardware"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","neural chips","sensor fusion","state estimation","tracking","State estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["AOA measurements","neural network construction","speed strip fitting","contact tracking","contact state estimation","NICE","neurally inspired contact estimation","angle-of-arrival","sensor fusion","AOA sensors","parallel hardware"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/253656/","chronOrPublicationDate":"31 Aug-2 Sep 1992","displayDocTitle":"Constructing neural networks for contact tracking","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1992","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"31 Aug.-2 Sept. 1992","accessionNumber":"4534006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Constructing neural networks for contact tracking","confLoc":"Helsingoer, Denmark","sourcePdf":"00253656.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057574S","chronDate":"31 Aug-2 Sep 1992","isNumber":"6460","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"631","citationCount":"3","articleId":"253656","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":253657,"authors":[{"name":"G.

Ordinary backward propagation (BP) and some variants of BP which incorporate lateral inhibition (LIBP) obtain a generalization rate of up to approximately 77% for novel data not used during training, a rate which is comparable to the mean level of classification accuracy that trained human observers obtained from the unprocessed simulated imagery.

This a priori knowledge can be interpreted as hints about the problem to be learned and these hints are encoded as rules which are then inserted into the neural network. The authors demonstrate the approach by training recurrent neural networks with inserted rules to learn to recognize regular languages from grammatical string examples. Because the recurrent networks have second-order connections, rule-insertion is a straightforward mapping of rules into weights and neurons. Simulations show that training recurrent networks with different amounts of partial knowledge to recognize simple grammers improves the training times by orders of magnitude, even when only a small fraction of all transitions are inserted as rules.

The frequency diversity inherent in the large bandwidth virtually eliminates the effect of drop-out due to multipath signal cancellation. A two or three-layer perceptron artificial neural network was used for synchronizing both the phase of the carrier frequency and the spreading code sequence. The network was trained with random samples of the code where the known phase was used to correct the network parameters. It was shown that the network could be trained to recognize the phase of a test sample after training with about 10000 presentations of the code.

The robot's contribution could be restricted to the laborious and repetitive work, whereas the human acts as a supervisor and handles exceptions. A new safety system has been developed which allows such a close interaction. One module has the task to localize people inside the working area and provide the robot with an appropriate behavior pattern in order to avoid situations endangering the operator. This module uses a camera and computer vision techniques to obtain the location of the operator. The other module of the safety system has to prevent a robot runaway, which can be defined as an unexpected robot motion due to a failure of robot hardware or software. Speech recognition is used as interface between operator and robot. A dedicated robot-control structure has been implemented permitting a fast and safe intervention of the operator by means of the speech system.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/253891/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-3 Sep 1992","publicationDate":"1992","conferenceDate":" 1992","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4508620","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Cooperation between man and robot: interface and safety","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cooperation between man and robot: interface and safety","confLoc":"Tokyo, Japan","sourcePdf":"00253891.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044912S","chronDate":"1-3 Sep 1992","isNumber":"6463","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"675","citationCount":"15","articleId":"253891","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":253895,"authors":[{"name":"N.

However, the EMG signal depends on physical condition, the state of mind and so on. So it is difficult that the original EMG signal could be used as a command for controlling an externally powered upper extremity prosthesis directly. In this paper, focusing on excellent functions of neural network of learning and processing, a discrimination system using a neural network for generating commands to control EMG-controlled externally powered upper extremity prosthesis is proposed. The neural network is used in this system to learn the relation between the power spectrum of the EMG signal analyzed by fast Fourier transform method and the performance desired by the handicapped. The neural network has three layers, that is, the input layer, the middle layer and the output layer. It was cleared that the discrimination system with the neural network could discriminate 7 performance from the EMG signals with the probability of 0.81.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ROMAN.1992.253914","pdfPath":"/iel2/675/6463/00253914.pdf","startPage":"63","endPage":"68","displayPublicationTitle":"[1992] Proceedings IEEE International Workshop on Robot and Human Communication","publicationTitle":"[1992] Proceedings IEEE International Workshop on Robot and Human Communication","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ROMAN.1992.253914","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6463","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A discrimination system using neural network for EMG-controlled prostheses","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/253914/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-3 Sep 1992","displayDocTitle":"A discrimination system using neural network for EMG-controlled prostheses","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4540084","publicationDate":"1992","conferenceDate":" 1992","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A discrimination system using neural network for EMG-controlled prostheses","confLoc":"Tokyo, Japan","sourcePdf":"00253914.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067101S","chronDate":"1-3 Sep 1992","isNumber":"6463","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"675","citationCount":"20","articleId":"253914","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":253927,"authors":[{"name":"Y.

A distributed feedback (DFB)-laser diode at lambda /sub 0/ equivalent to 1.3 mu m tuned within a range of Delta lambda equivalent to 6 nm and Delta v equivalent to 1 THz, respectively, is used as a source in the experimental arrangement. An auxiliary interferometer is employed so that the tuning need not be linear in time, in contrast to early implementations. At present, with waveguide structures on InP under test, a spatial resolution of 50 mu m and a dynamic range of about 60 dB are obtained. These data surpass OFDR results published so far. Prospects of closing the gap to coherence-domain reflectometric results and specific advantages make OFDR a promising technique.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/254098/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1993","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1993","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Aug. 1993","accessionNumber":"4580263","volume":"11","issue":"8","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Coherent frequency-domain reflectometry for characterization of single-mode integrated-optical waveguides","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Coherent frequency-domain reflectometry for characterization of single-mode integrated-optical waveguides","sourcePdf":"00254098.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.030208S","chronDate":"Aug 1993","isNumber":"6469","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"165","articleId":"254098","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-12-24"},{"_id":254352,"authors":[{"name":"T.

Several industrial applications of this technique (especially in nuclear power plants) are discussed.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/IECON.1992.254388","pdfPath":"/iel2/637/6472/00254388.pdf","startPage":"1449","endPage":"1454 vol.3","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 1992 International Conference on Industrial Electronics, Control, Instrumentation, and Automation","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 1992 International Conference on Industrial Electronics, Control, Instrumentation, and Automation","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IECON.1992.254388","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6472","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fault monitoring using neural networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/254388/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-13 Nov 1992","displayDocTitle":"Fault monitoring using neural networks","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4523751","publicationDate":"1992","conferenceDate":"13-13 Nov. 1992","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fault monitoring using neural networks","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00254388.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041687S","chronDate":"9-13 Nov 1992","isNumber":"6472","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"637","articleId":"254388","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":254429,"authors":[{"name":"P.

The scheme is based on a stator flux asynchronous vector modulation (SFAVM) imposed by a digital bandlimited white noise generator. The modulation strategy is tested in a 1 kVA high-performance 16 b microprocessor controlled AC drive system. Fast Fourier transform spectra on the line-line voltage and the acoustic noise are presented, and it is shown that the new modulation strategy can decrease the noise effect. The stator flux polygon and the line current are measured, and the random modulation strategy is demonstrated. The total sound pressure level from the AC machine is investigated with fixed switching frequencies and with different random modulated frequency spans. It is concluded that a properly chosen fixed switching frequency has the lowest total sound pressure level. However, the random modulation strategy distributes the noise frequencies, and the noise is much more comfortable and less annoying.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pdfPath":"/iel2/637/6472/00254622.pdf","startPage":"265","endPage":"270 vol.1","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 1992 International Conference on Industrial Electronics, Control, Instrumentation, and Automation","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6472","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IECON.1992.254622","doi":"10.1109/IECON.1992.254622","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 1992 International Conference on Industrial Electronics, Control, Instrumentation, and Automation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=254622","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Digital modulation","Acoustic noise","Acoustic testing","AC machines","Stators","Switching frequency","White noise","System testing","Microprocessors","Control systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["AC motors","digital control","electric drives","fast Fourier transforms","machine control","magnetic flux","microcomputer applications","modulation","pulse width modulation","stators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["AC motor drive","machine control","digital control","fast Fourier transform","PWM","performance","acoustic noise","stator flux asynchronous vector modulation","microprocessor","stator flux polygon","line current","random modulation strategy","sound pressure level","switching frequencies","16 bit","1 kVA"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-13 Nov 1992","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/254622/","displayDocTitle":"Implementation and test of a digital quasi-random modulated SFAVM PWM in a high performance drive system","accessionNumber":"4513190","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1992","conferenceDate":"13-13 Nov. 1992","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Implementation and test of a digital quasi-random modulated SFAVM PWM in a high performance drive system","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00254622.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060209S","chronDate":"9-13 Nov 1992","isNumber":"6472","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"637","citationCount":"38","articleId":"254622","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":254623,"authors":[{"name":"J.

In the proposed current control, fast response is realized by introducing a converter model in the control algorithm and the effect of parameter difference between the model and an actual system is compensated for through proportional-plus-integral control of current difference. In PWM pattern generation, the balance of two capacitor voltages is taken into account. For the same sampling period, the current distortion factor of the proposed system can be approximately reduced to 60% of that of a conventional two-level power converter. The prototype was made using a digital signal processor, and simulation and experimental results were compared.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/PESC.1992.254709","publicationTitle":"PESC '92 Record. 23rd Annual IEEE Power Electronics Specialists Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"PESC '92 Record. 23rd Annual IEEE Power Electronics Specialists Conference","pdfPath":"/iel2/660/6473/00254709.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PESC.1992.254709","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6473","startPage":"175","endPage":"180 vol.1","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"PWM control and input characteristics of three-phase multi-level AC/DC converter","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=254709","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"PWM control and input characteristics of three-phase multi-level AC/DC converter","chronOrPublicationDate":"29 Jun-3 Jul 1992","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/254709/","conferenceDate":"29 June-3 July 1992","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1992","accessionNumber":"4513060","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"PWM control and input characteristics of three-phase multi-level AC/DC converter","confLoc":"Toledo, Spain","sourcePdf":"00254709.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.024383S","chronDate":"29 Jun-3 Jul 1992","isNumber":"6473","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"660","citationCount":"37","articleId":"254709","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":254717,"authors":[{"name":"T.A.

It is clarified that the power factor decreases to about 0.7 in continuous mode by constant duty ratio operation, and it can be improved to over 0.9 by a new input current control system.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/PESC.1992.254766","publicationTitle":"PESC '92 Record. 23rd Annual IEEE Power Electronics Specialists Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"PESC '92 Record. 23rd Annual IEEE Power Electronics Specialists Conference","pdfPath":"/iel2/660/6473/00254766.pdf","startPage":"1071","endPage":"1076 vol.2","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00254766.png","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6473","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PESC.1992.254766","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 29 1992-July 3 1992","displayDocTitle":"A high-power-factor buck converter","conferenceDate":"29 June-3 July 1992","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1992","accessionNumber":"4513150","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/254766/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A high-power-factor buck converter","confLoc":"Toledo, Spain","sourcePdf":"00254766.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.0351S","chronDate":"June 29 1992-July 3 1992","isNumber":"6473","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"660","citationCount":"93","articleId":"254766","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2022-01-15"},{"_id":254768,"authors":[{"name":"P.

The study is applicable to boost, buck-boost, flyback, SEPIC, and Cuk topologies. The main conclusion is that the switching frequency variation range using a half-wave resonant switch is lower than that using a full-wave resonant switch if the load connected to the output is almost constant. Moreover, using topologies with a transformer (flyback, SEPIC or Cuk), this variation range can be minimized choosing an adequate value of the normalized switching frequency at the peak of the sinusoidal input voltage. However. this range increases greatly when the load changes in the same manner. In this case, a reduced switching frequency variation range is obtained using a full-wave switch. However, this type of resonant switch decreases the efficiency because it handles reactive energy, and then a trade-off between switching frequency variation range and efficiency must be considered.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/PESC.1992.254768","publicationTitle":"PESC '92 Record. 23rd Annual IEEE Power Electronics Specialists Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"PESC '92 Record. 23rd Annual IEEE Power Electronics Specialists Conference","pdfPath":"/iel2/660/6473/00254768.pdf","startPage":"1052","endPage":"1060 vol.2","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6473","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PESC.1992.254768","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"29 Jun-3 Jul 1992","displayDocTitle":"Analysis of the zero-current-switched quasiresonant converters used as power factor preregulators","conferenceDate":"29 June-3 July 1992","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1992","accessionNumber":"4513148","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/254768/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis of the zero-current-switched quasiresonant converters used as power factor preregulators","confLoc":"Toledo, Spain","sourcePdf":"00254768.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.030449S","chronDate":"29 Jun-3 Jul 1992","isNumber":"6473","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"660","citationCount":"14","articleId":"254768","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":254769,"authors":[{"name":"M.

The method is based on estimating the instantaneous SR motor torque from the flux linkage versus current and rotor position characteristic curves via a bi-cubic spline interpolation. These coefficients are computed offline, stored in a given memory location of the control processor, and used by two routines that are capable of estimating the rotor position and electromagnetic torque from the phase voltages and currents. The estimated output torque is then compared to a constant reference value, and the result of this comparison drives a current regulator that generates the proper motor phase currents. The ripple minimization scheme is simple and does not require a very fast processor. Its feasibility is confirmed via simulation and some preliminary experimental results.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"PESC '92 Record. 23rd Annual IEEE Power Electronics Specialists Conference","pdfPath":"/iel2/660/6473/00254794.pdf","startPage":"851","endPage":"856 vol.2","publicationTitle":"PESC '92 Record. 23rd Annual IEEE Power Electronics Specialists Conference","doi":"10.1109/PESC.1992.254794","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PESC.1992.254794","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6473","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=254794","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Torque ripple minimization in switched reluctance motors via bi-cubic spline interpolation","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Reluctance motors","Strontium","Rotors","Phase estimation","Couplings","Spline","Interpolation","Torque control","Voltage control","Process control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["interpolation","reluctance motors","rotors","splines (mathematics)","torque"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["torque ripple minimisation","switched reluctance motors","bi-cubic spline interpolation","flux linkage","rotor position characteristic curves","electromagnetic torque","current regulator","motor phase currents"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/254794/","chronOrPublicationDate":"29 Jun-3 Jul 1992","displayDocTitle":"Torque ripple minimization in switched reluctance motors via bi-cubic spline interpolation","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1992","accessionNumber":"4513122","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"29 June-3 July 1992","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Torque ripple minimization in switched reluctance motors via bi-cubic spline interpolation","confLoc":"Toledo, Spain","sourcePdf":"00254794.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.031865S","chronDate":"29 Jun-3 Jul 1992","isNumber":"6473","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"660","citationCount":"58","articleId":"254794","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":254801,"authors":[{"name":"J.M.

The use of synchronous frame regulators is seen to yield significant improvement in overall modulator performance.

This NN controller has the potential of replacing the proportional-plus-integral (PI) controller traditionally used for HVDC (high-voltage direct-current) transmission systems. A simplified theoretical basis for the operational behavior of the individual NN controllers is presented. Comparisons between the responses obtained with the NN and PI controllers for the rectifier of an HDVC transmission system are made under typical system perturbation and faults. It is shown that the combined NN controller can adapt its weights online to provide improved or similar performance, when compared to traditional PI controllers, for small- and large-signal disturbances. The response of this simple NN controller is somewhat slower for very fast transients, perhaps due to the inadequate training.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/PESC.1992.254833","pdfPath":"/iel2/660/6473/00254833.pdf","startPage":"553","endPage":"560 vol.1","displayPublicationTitle":"PESC '92 Record. 23rd Annual IEEE Power Electronics Specialists Conference","publicationTitle":"PESC '92 Record. 23rd Annual IEEE Power Electronics Specialists Conference","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00254833.png","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PESC.1992.254833","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6473","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Comparative evaluation of neural network based and PI current controllers for HVDC transmission","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/254833/","chronOrPublicationDate":"29 Jun-3 Jul 1992","displayDocTitle":"Comparative evaluation of neural network based and PI current controllers for HVDC transmission","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4513083","publicationDate":"1992","conferenceDate":"29 June-3 July 1992","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Comparative evaluation of neural network based and PI current controllers for HVDC transmission","confLoc":"Toledo, Spain","sourcePdf":"00254833.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044741S","chronDate":"29 Jun-3 Jul 1992","isNumber":"6473","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"660","citationCount":"4","articleId":"254833","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":254839,"authors":[{"name":"W.

This is probably based on the intuitive feeling that switching pattern discontinuities dead-band-degrade the quality of output/input voltage/current waveforms by introducing low-order harmonics. The authors challenge this notion by showing that discontinuous switching patterns for PWM converters can yield better performance than their continuous counterparts. Performance is defined as harmonic distortion normalized with respect to switching frequency, and serves as a measure of comparison with continuous PWM techniques. The applications considered include general-purpose and application-specific solid-state power supplies utilizing voltage current inverters and PWM synchronous or buck-type rectifiers. Theoretical considerations are verified on an experimental unit.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/PESC.1992.254849","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PESC.1992.254849","startPage":"427","endPage":"434 vol.1","displayPublicationTitle":"PESC '92 Record. 23rd Annual IEEE Power Electronics Specialists Conference","pdfPath":"/iel2/660/6473/00254849.pdf","publicationTitle":"PESC '92 Record. 23rd Annual IEEE Power Electronics Specialists Conference","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6473","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"'Dead-band' PWM switching patterns","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"29 Jun-3 Jul 1992","displayDocTitle":"'Dead-band' PWM switching patterns","conferenceDate":"29 June-3 July 1992","publicationDate":"1992","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"4513067","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/254849/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"'Dead-band' PWM switching patterns","confLoc":"Toledo, Spain","sourcePdf":"00254849.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.035842S","chronDate":"29 Jun-3 Jul 1992","isNumber":"6473","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"660","citationCount":"23","articleId":"254849","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":254852,"authors":[{"name":"V.

The use of structured code sequences with an optimum matched filter produces small crosscorrelation magnitudes. However, such an optimum filter requires a multilevel impulse response and its implementation as a DMF detector requires that the impulse response be quantised and digitised, thereby increasing the filter complexity. In the present study an optimum DMF detector with structured code sequences is evaluated and compared with an equivalent analogue matched filter detector using the signal to noise ratio (SNR) at the correlator output as a performance measure. The results are used to identify the minimum amount of input signal and impulse particular load-sharing response quantisation required in order to reduce circuit complexity while maintaining an acceptable system performance.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ICCS.1992.255122","publicationTitle":"[Proceedings] Singapore ICCS/ISITA `92","displayPublicationTitle":"[Proceedings] Singapore ICCS/ISITA `92","pdfPath":"/iel2/679/6474/00255122.pdf","startPage":"949","endPage":"952 vol.2","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCS.1992.255122","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6474","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The performance of an optimum digital matched filter detector using structured code sequences for CDMA applications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=255122","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-20 Nov 1992","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/255122/","displayDocTitle":"The performance of an optimum digital matched filter detector using structured code sequences for CDMA applications","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1992","accessionNumber":"4513349","conferenceDate":" 1992","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The performance of an optimum digital matched filter detector using structured code sequences for CDMA applications","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"00255122.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.029156S","chronDate":"16-20 Nov 1992","isNumber":"6474","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"679","articleId":"255122","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":255125,"authors":[{"name":"M.

In fact the definition of a coverage strategy requires suitable frequency reuse thus producing the above-mentioned interference effects. As regards vehicle-to-vehicle communication, a scenario oriented to highways is considered; in this situation, a first step in estimating the transmission performance has to be done when the link between two communicating vehicles is affected by a single co-channel interferer. This analysis is carried out by considering anomalous propagation conditions both for the useful and the interference signals: to describe the system performance the authors not only consider their power levels, but evaluate the interfered system outage probability. Moreover, in order to counteract the effects of anomalous propagation some kind of diversity techniques are investigated. Finally, rain effects will be evaluated at different carrier frequencies.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"[Proceedings] Singapore ICCS/ISITA `92","pdfPath":"/iel2/679/6474/00255127.pdf","startPage":"924","endPage":"928 vol.2","publicationTitle":"[Proceedings] Singapore ICCS/ISITA `92","doi":"10.1109/ICCS.1992.255127","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCS.1992.255127","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6474","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=255127","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Impact of cochannel interference on vehicle-to-vehicle communications at millimeter waves","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interchannel interference","Frequency","Millimeter wave communication","Millimeter wave technology","Land mobile radio","Mobile communication","Road transportation","Road vehicles","Signal analysis","Performance analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["diversity reception","frequency allocation","mobile radio systems","radiofrequency interference","rain","telecommunication channels","tropospheric electromagnetic wave propagation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["roads","CCI","EHF","MM-waves","cochannel interference","vehicle-to-vehicle communications","millimeter wave mobile radio network","coverage strategy","frequency reuse","highways","transmission performance","anomalous propagation conditions","system performance","power levels","outage probability","diversity techniques","rain effects","carrier frequencies","60 to 65 GHz"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/255127/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-20 Nov 1992","displayDocTitle":"Impact of cochannel interference on vehicle-to-vehicle communications at millimeter waves","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1992","accessionNumber":"4513344","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":" 1992","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Impact of cochannel interference on vehicle-to-vehicle communications at millimeter waves","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"00255127.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.039809S","chronDate":"16-20 Nov 1992","isNumber":"6474","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"679","citationCount":"12","articleId":"255127","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":255147,"authors":[{"name":"M.H.

This assumption yields a fairly high probability of interception, even for signals of short duration. By explicitly considering the effect of uncertain knowledge of the noise power density, it is demonstrated that detection of these signals by a wideband radiometer can be considerably more difficult in practice than is indicated by the standard result. Worst-case performance bounds are provided as a function of input signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), time-bandwidth (TW) product and peak-to-peak noise uncertainty. The results are illustrated graphically for a number of situations of interest. It is also shown that asymptotically, as the TW product becomes large, the SNR required for detection becomes a function of noise uncertainty only and is independent of the detection parameters and the observation interval.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/7/6492/00256287.pdf","startPage":"654","endPage":"660","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems","doi":"10.1109/7.256287","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/7.256287","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6492","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=256287","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Radiometric detection of spread-spectrum signals in noise of uncertain power","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Radiometry","Spread spectrum communication","Signal detection","Signal to noise ratio","Uncertainty","Measurement standards","Signal analysis","Gaussian noise","Density measurement","Power measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["probability","radiometry","signal detection","white noise"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["worst case performance","spread-spectrum signals","standard analysis","radiometric detectability","white Gaussian noise","power spectral density","probability of interception","uncertain knowledge","noise power density","wideband radiometer","signal-to-noise ratio","time-bandwidth","peak-to-peak noise uncertainty"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/256287/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul 1992","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul 1992","displayDocTitle":"Radiometric detection of spread-spectrum signals in noise of uncertain power","volume":"28","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"July 1992","accessionNumber":"4246116","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Radiometric detection of spread-spectrum signals in noise of uncertain power","sourcePdf":"00256287.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.034396S","chronDate":"Jul 1992","isNumber":"6492","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7","citationCount":"264","articleId":"256287","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":256292,"authors":[{"name":"F.

The signal transmitted from the satellite was received and recorded at a mobile unit moving in different streets of the downtown area. The streets chosen have typical downtown medium and high rise buildings, electric utility poles, trees, etc., which caused obstruction to the satellite line of sight. The propagation characteristics such as fade/nonfade distribution, joint fade and nonfade distribution, phase distribution, and their dependence on the antenna type are discussed for the measured link. Error characteristics in digital communication for the above link have been qualitatively analyzed on the basis of the measured signal level fluctuation.

A general method is developed for determining, from the covariance matrix, minimal d-dimensional error ellipsoids for the state vectors which always overlap when a gating criterion is satisfied. Circumscribing boxes, or d-ranges, for the data ellipsoids are then found and whenever they overlap the association probability is computed. For efficiently determining the intersections of the d-ranges, a multidimensional search tree method is used to reduce the overall scaling of the evaluation of associations. Very few associations that lie outside the predetermined error threshold or gate are evaluated. The search method developed is a fixed Mahalanobis distance search. Empirical tests for variously distributed data in both three and eight dimensions indicate that the scaling is significantly reduced. Computational loads for many large-scale data association tasks can therefore be significantly reduced by this or related methods.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient gating in data association with multivariate Gaussian distributed states","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems","doi":"10.1109/7.256316","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/7/6492/00256316.pdf","startPage":"909","endPage":"916","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/7.256316","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6492","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=256316","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/256316/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul 1992","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul 1992","displayDocTitle":"Efficient gating in data association with multivariate Gaussian distributed states","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"28","issue":"3","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"July 1992","accessionNumber":"4251224","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient gating in data association with multivariate Gaussian distributed states","sourcePdf":"00256316.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.040128S","chronDate":"Jul 1992","isNumber":"6492","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7","citationCount":"61","articleId":"256316","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":256317,"authors":[{"name":"M.

It demonstrated that the repetition rate of the physiological PFP train introduces repeated peaks in the power spectrum, and that it affects the spectrum mainly at low frequencies. The theoretical results also show that the spectral peaks at multiples of the PFP repetition rate become more evident when the variance of the interpulse interval (IPI) is small, and that these spectral peaks shift toward higher frequencies with increasing PFP repetition rates. To evaluate the mathematical model, a simulation algorithm which generate PFP signals with adjustable repetition rate and IPI variance was developed. Results of simulations and analysis of signals recorded from human subjects support the mathematical model's prediction that the IPI statistics play a very significant role in determining the low-end power spectrum of the physiological PFP signal. Evidence is presented to show that ignoring these IPI statistics will affect the interpretation of the spectrum.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/10.256431","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/10/6495/00256431.pdf","startPage":"971","endPage":"979","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/10.256431","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6495","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Mathematical modeling and spectrum analysis of the physiological patello-femoral pulse train produced by slow knee movement","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=256431","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  1992","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  1992","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/256431/","displayDocTitle":"Mathematical modeling and spectrum analysis of the physiological patello-femoral pulse train produced by slow knee movement","volume":"39","issue":"9","publicationDate":"Sept. 1992","accessionNumber":"4288072","pubMedId":"1473826","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Mathematical modeling and spectrum analysis of the physiological patello-femoral pulse train produced by slow knee movement","sourcePdf":"00256431.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.08159S","chronDate":"Sept.  1992","isNumber":"6495","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"22","articleId":"256431","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":256444,"authors":[{"name":"N.

The results are based on multiprocessor simulations with 8, 16, and 32 processors. To provide deeper insight into the observed invalidation behavior the invalidations observed in the simulations are linked to the high-level objects causing them in the programs. To predict what the invalidation patterns would look like beyond 32 processors, a classification scheme for data objects found in parallel programs is proposed. The classification scheme provides a powerful conceptual tool to reason about the invalidation patterns of parallel applications. Results indicate that it should be possible to scale well-written parallel programs to a large number of processors without an explosion in invalidation traffic. At the same time, the invalidation patterns are such that directory-based schemes with just a few pointers per entry can be very effective. The variations in invalidation behavior with different cache line sizes are discussed. The results indicate that cache line sizes in the 32-byte range yield the lowest data and invalidation traffic.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Protocols","Broadcasting","Large-scale systems","Pattern analysis","Explosions","Electronic mail","Kernel","Data structures"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["buffer storage","digital simulation","multiprocessing systems","parallel programming"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["shared-memory multiprocessors","cache invalidation patterns","simulations","high-level objects","classification scheme","data objects","parallel programs","conceptual tool","invalidation patterns","directory-based schemes"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=256449","doi":"10.1109/12.256449","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel1/12/6496/00256449.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/12.256449","startPage":"794","endPage":"810","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6496","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cache invalidation patterns in shared-memory multiprocessors","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Cache invalidation patterns in shared-memory multiprocessors","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/256449/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul 1992","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul 1992","volume":"41","issue":"7","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"July 1992","accessionNumber":"4261661","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cache invalidation patterns in shared-memory multiprocessors","sourcePdf":"00256449.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.062218S","chronDate":"Jul 1992","isNumber":"6496","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"81","articleId":"256449","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":256450,"authors":[{"name":"J.P.

To obtain miss ratios, the function u(t, L), defined to be the number of unique lines of size L referenced before time t, is modeled. Empirical observations show that this function appears to have the form u(t, L)=(W L/sup a/t/sup b/) (d/sup log/ /sup L log t/) where W, a, b, d are constants that are related, respectively, to the working set size, locality of references to nearby addresses (spatial locality), temporal locality (locality in time not attributable to spatial locality), and interactions between spatial locality and temporal locality. The miss ratio of a finite fully associative cache can be approximated as the time derivative of u(t, L) evaluated where the function has a value equal to the size of the cache. When the miss ratios from this model are compared to measured miss ratios for a representative trace, the accuracy is high for large caches. For smaller caches, the model is close but not highly precise.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=256450","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Predictive models","Shape measurement","Cache memory","Mathematical model","Design methodology","Computer science","Parameter estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["buffer storage","content-addressable storage","memory architecture"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["model of workloads","miss-rate prediction","fully associative caches","mathematical model","behavior of programs","fully associative cache","least-recently-used replacement","spatial locality","temporal locality"]}],"publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel1/12/6496/00256450.pdf","startPage":"811","endPage":"825","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6496","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/12.256450","doi":"10.1109/12.256450","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A model of workloads and its use in miss-rate prediction for fully associative caches","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul 1992","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul 1992","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/256450/","displayDocTitle":"A model of workloads and its use in miss-rate prediction for fully associative caches","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"July 1992","accessionNumber":"4261662","volume":"41","issue":"7","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A model of workloads and its use in miss-rate prediction for fully associative caches","sourcePdf":"00256450.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.03743S","chronDate":"Jul 1992","isNumber":"6496","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"36","articleId":"256450","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":256484,"authors":[{"name":"U.M.

An enemy who knows the random variable Z, jointly distributed with X and Y according to some probability distribution P/sub XYZ/, can also receive all messages exchanged by the two parties over a public channel. The goal of a protocol is that the enemy obtains at most a negligible amount of information about S. Upper bounds on H(S) as a function of P/sub XYZ/ are presented. Lower bounds on the rate H(S)/N (as N to infinity ) are derived for the case in which X=(X/sub 1/, . . ., X/sub N/), Y=(Y/sub 1/, . . ., Y/sub N/) and Z=(Z/sub 1/, . . ., Z/sub N/) result from N independent executions of a random experiment generating X/sub i/, Y/sub i/ and Z/sub i/ for i=1, . . ., N.

The notion of resolvability of a channel, defined as the number of random bits required per channel use in order to generate an input that achieves arbitrarily accurate approximation of the output statistics for any given input process, is introduced. A general formula for resolvability that holds regardless of the channel memory structure is obtained. It is shown that for most channels, resolvability is equal to the Shannon capacity. By-products of the analysis are a general formula for the minimum achievable source coding rate of any finite-alphabet source and a strong converse of the identification coding theorem, which holds for any channel that satisfies the strong converse of the channel coding theorem.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/256486/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May  1993","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  1993","volume":"39","issue":"3","accessionNumber":"4505246","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"May 1993","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Approximation theory of output statistics","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Approximation theory of output statistics","sourcePdf":"256486.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.026845S","chronDate":"May  1993","isNumber":"6498","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"419","articleId":"256486","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":256487,"authors":[{"name":"R.S.

The performance of two low-complexity VQs-the tree-structured VQ (TSVQ) and the multistage VQ (MSVQ)-when used over noisy channels are analyzed. An algorithm is developed for the design of channel-matched TSVQ (CM-TSVQ) and channel-matched MSVQ (CM-MSVQ) under the squared-error criterion. Extensive numerical results are given for the correlation coefficient 0.9. Comparisons with the ordinary TSVQ and MSVQ designed for the noiseless channel show substantial improvements when the channel is very noisy. The CM-MSVQ, which can be regarded as a block-structured combined source-channel coding scheme, is compared with a block-structured tandem source-channel coding scheme (with the same block length as the CM-MSVQ). For the Gauss-Markov source, the CM-MSVQ outperforms the tandem scheme in all cases that the authors have considered.

The fixed-rate scalar-vector quantizer (SVQ) for quantizing stationary memoryless sources is extended to a specific type of vector source in which each component is a stationary memoryless scalar subsource independent of the other components. Algorithms for the design and implementation of the original SVQ are modified to apply to this case. The resulting SVQ, referred to as the extended SVQ (ESVQ), is then used to quantize stationary sources with memory (with known autocorrelation function). Numerical results are presented for the quantization of first-order Gauss-Markov sources using this scheme. It is shown that the ESVQ-based scheme performs very close to entropy-coded transform quantization while maintaining a fixed-rate output and outperforms the fixed-rate scheme that uses scalar Lloyd-Max quantization of the transform coefficients. It is also shown that this scheme performs better than implementable vector quantizers, especially at high rates.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/256494/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May  1993","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  1993","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","publicationDate":"May 1993","accessionNumber":"4505254","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","volume":"39","issue":"3","displayDocTitle":"A structured fixed-rate vector quantizer derived from a variable-length scalar quantizer.

A passive matched filter approach is used, and the acquisition window length, which is the length of the matched filter, determines the complexity of the acquisition scheme. The acquisition-based capacity of a DS/SS system is defined to be the maximum number of simultaneous transmissions permissible while maintaining acceptable acquisition performance. The performance of the acquisition scheme is evaluated for large acquisition window length, and the asymptotic analysis yields the capacity as a function of the acquisition window length. If this length is linearly related to the processed gain, the acquisition-based capacity is smaller than that obtained by consideration of post-acquisition criteria only (e.g., bit-error probability for the demodulated signal). The results indicate the relative importance of the acquisition problem and suggest directions for further research.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/6498/00256498.pdf","startPage":"903","endPage":"912","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","doi":"10.1109/18.256498","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/18.256498","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6498","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=256498","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Acquisition in direct-sequence spread-spectrum communication networks: an asymptotic analysis","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Intelligent networks","Spread spectrum communication","Communication networks","Matched filters","Multiaccess communication","Bit error rate","Performance analysis","Bandwidth","Radio transmitters","Gain measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel capacity","code division multiple access","filtering and prediction theory","matched filters","spread spectrum communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CDMA","DS-SSMA","direct-sequence spread-spectrum communication networks","asymptotic analysis","multiple-access interference","passive matched filter","acquisition window length","acquisition-based capacity","DS/SS system"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/256498/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  1993","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May  1993","displayDocTitle":"Acquisition in direct-sequence spread-spectrum communication networks: an asymptotic analysis","volume":"39","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May 1993","accessionNumber":"4505258","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Acquisition in direct-sequence spread-spectrum communication networks: an asymptotic analysis","sourcePdf":"256498.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.037699S","chronDate":"May  1993","isNumber":"6498","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"86","articleId":"256498","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":256499,"authors":[{"name":"F.R.

When the criterion is one of minimizing the average transmitted energy for a given average bit rate, the best possible distribution with which to select constellations points is a Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution. In principle, when constellation points are selected according to a Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution, the ultimate shaping gain ( pi e/6 or 1.53 dB) can be achieved in any dimension. Nonuniform signaling schemes can be designed by mapping simple variable-length prefix codes onto the constellation. Using the Huffman procedure, prefix codes can be designed that approach the optimal performance.

It is shown that feedforward networks with one layer of sigmoidal nonlinearities achieve integrated squared error of order O(1/n), where n is the number of nodes. The approximated function is assumed to have a bound on the first moment of the magnitude distribution of the Fourier transform. The nonlinear parameters associated with the sigmoidal nodes, as well as the parameters of linear combination, are adjusted in the approximation. In contrast, it is shown that for series expansions with n terms, in which only the parameters of linear combination are adjusted, the integrated squared approximation error cannot be made smaller than order 1/n/sup 2/d/ uniformly for functions satisfying the same smoothness assumption, where d is the dimension of the input to the function.

In particular, the main results indicate that powering and division can be computed by polynomial-size ANNs of depth 4, and multiple product can be computed by polynomial-size ANNs of depth 5. Moreover, using the techniques developed, a previous result can be improved by showing that the sorting of n n-bit numbers can be carried out in a depth-3 polynomial-size ANN.

The ODEs describing the motion of several common adaptive filters are examined in some simple settings, including the least mean square (LMS) algorithm and all three of its signed variants (the signed regressor, the signed error, and the sign-sign algorithms). Stability and instability results are presented in terms of the eigenvalues of a correlation-like matrix. This generalizes known results for LMS, signed regressor LMS, and signed error LMS, and gives new stability criteria for the sign-sign algorithm. The ability of the algorithms to track moving parameterizations can be analyzed in a similar manner, by relating the time varying system to a forced ODE. The asymptotic distribution about the forced ODE is an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process, the properties of which can be described in a straightforward manner.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  1993","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/256503/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May  1993","volume":"39","issue":"3","accessionNumber":"4505263","publicationDate":"May 1993","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Weak convergence and local stability properties of fixed step size recursive algorithms","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Weak convergence and local stability properties of fixed step size recursive algorithms","sourcePdf":"256503.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.04288S","chronDate":"May  1993","isNumber":"6498","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"68","articleId":"256503","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":256506,"authors":[{"name":"L.

Performance analysis involving these variates requires a complete description of the statistical distribution of the quadratic form. Such a complete description is presented. The method used is based on inverting the characteristic function of the quadratic form by solving a number of convolution integrals. The results presented include two forms for the probability density function (PDF), an expression for the cumulative distribution function (CDF), and expressions for the distribution moments and cumulants. These results are shown to reduce to previously known results for some special cases. Relations of the quadratic form and its CDF to the noncentral chi /sup 2/ (chi-square) and the complex noncentral Wishart distributions are exposed. Evaluation of the CDF at the origin is shown to reduce to the doubly noncentral F-distribution due to R. Price (1962, 1964). A generalization of the Marcum Q-function is also identified and suggested.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/18.256521","startPage":"1076","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/6498/00256521.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/18.256521","endPage":"1082","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6498","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Statistical distributions of Hermitian quadratic forms in complex Gaussian variables","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/256521/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May  1993","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  1993","displayDocTitle":"Statistical distributions of Hermitian quadratic forms in complex Gaussian variables","volume":"39","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4505281","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"May 1993","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Statistical distributions of Hermitian quadratic forms in complex Gaussian variables","sourcePdf":"256521.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.050831S","chronDate":"May  1993","isNumber":"6498","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"42","articleId":"256521","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":256522,"authors":[{"name":"J.

The bound improves by a factor of four a similar result derived by V.D. Kolesnik and V.Y. Krachkovsky (1991). This generalization is derived by analysing a code search algorithm referred to as the altruistic algorithm. This algorithm iteratively deletes potential codewords so that at each iteration the candidate is removed. The bound is derived by demonstrating that, as the algorithm proceeds, the average volume of a sphere of a given radius approaches the maximum such volume and so a bound previously expressed in terms of the maximum volume can in fact be expressed in terms of the average volume. Examples of applications where the bound is relevant include error-correcting (d,k) codes and binary codes for code division multiple access.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/6498/00256522.pdf","startPage":"1089","endPage":"1093","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A generalized Gilbert-Varshamov bound derived via analysis of a code-search algorithm","doi":"10.1109/18.256522","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6498","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/18.256522","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=256522","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/256522/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May  1993","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  1993","displayDocTitle":"A generalized Gilbert-Varshamov bound derived via analysis of a code-search algorithm","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"May 1993","accessionNumber":"4505284","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"39","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A generalized Gilbert-Varshamov bound derived via analysis of a code-search algorithm","sourcePdf":"256522.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.037634S","chronDate":"May  1993","isNumber":"6498","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"13","articleId":"256522","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":256523,"authors":[{"name":"J.M.

In the simulation, the ANFIS architecture is employed to model nonlinear functions, identify nonlinear components on-line in a control system, and predict a chaotic time series, all yielding remarkable results.

The coordinated control of multiple robots is another challenging problem. In a multiple-robot system, each robot is a stand-alone device equipped with commercially designed servo controllers. When such robots hold a solid object, failure of their effective coordination may damage the object and/or the robots. To overcome these problems, we propose to design a direct adaptive controller and a coordinator using neural networks. One of the key problems in designing such a controller/coordinator is to develop an efficient training algorithm. A neural network is usually trained using the output errors of the network, not controlled plant. However, when a neural network is used to directly control a plant, the output errors of the network are unknown, because the desired control actions are unknown. A simple training algorithm is proposed. that enables the neural network to be trained with the output errors of the controlled plant. The only a priori knowledge of the controlled plant is the direction of its output response. A detailed analysis of the algorithm is presented and the associated theorems are proved. Due to its simple structure, algorithm and good performance, the proposed scheme has high potential for handling the difficult problems arising from industrial process control and multiple-system coordination.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/21.256542","startPage":"686","endPage":"697","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/21.256542","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6499","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics","pdfPath":"/iel1/21/6499/00256542.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Direct control and coordination using neural networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/256542/","displayDocTitle":"Direct control and coordination using neural networks","volume":"23","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4587225","publicationDate":"May-June 1993","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"May/Jun 1993","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May/Jun 1993","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Direct control and coordination using neural networks","sourcePdf":"00256542.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.05565S","chronDate":"May/Jun 1993","isNumber":"6499","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"21","citationCount":"84","articleId":"256542","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":256543,"authors":[{"name":"J.M.

We extend this experimental methodology to include measurement of dynamic components of impedance. The stiffness-damping-mass characteristics are represented numerically as matrices and graphically as ellipses characterized by size, shape, and orientation. The latter depict the predominant nonrotational component of the impedance force fields. The results suggest: (1) joint damping is related to both joint stiffness and joint inertia; and (2) two-joint impedances, i.e., impedances associated with muscles connected across both the elbow and shoulder joints, play a relatively smaller role in damping than in stiffness. The ability to modulate stiffness in the face of initial static bias forces, i.e., \"loading\", is also examined. We observe regular shifts in the human arm endpoint's \"spring center\" corresponding to the bias force directions and magnitudes.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/21.256543","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics","pdfPath":"/iel1/21/6499/00256543.pdf","startPage":"698","endPage":"709","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/21.256543","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6499","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dynamic and loaded impedance components in the maintenance of human arm posture","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=256543","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May/Jun 1993","chronOrPublicationDate":"May/Jun 1993","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/256543/","displayDocTitle":"Dynamic and loaded impedance components in the maintenance of human arm posture","volume":"23","issue":"3","publicationDate":"May-June 1993","accessionNumber":"4587226","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamic and loaded impedance components in the maintenance of human arm posture","sourcePdf":"00256543.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.062113S","chronDate":"May/Jun 1993","isNumber":"6499","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"21","citationCount":"165","articleId":"256543","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":256583,"authors":[{"name":"W.

The circuit converts 16 channels in parallel via a single slope ramp and Gray code counter algorithm. When biased for 10.0 mu s conversions of a 2-V input range into 4050 voltage bins, and ohmically connected to a computer, initial testing shows that typical performance is a noise level of 0.3 bins rms, an integral nonlinearity of 4 bins, adjacent channel crosstalk effects of less than 1 bin, and a total chip power consumption of 110 mW. The chip contains 16 sample and hold circuits, out of range logic, a Gray-to-binary converter, and tri-state data outputs for microprocessor compatibility. The die size is 4.4 by 1.5 mm in a 2 polysilicon, 1.2- mu m feature size CMOS process, and has 52 bonding pads.

The long-range alpha detector (LRAD) detects the ions produced by the alpha particles passing through air, rather than the alpha particles themselves, limiting LRAD detection by the range of the ions (tens of meters), rather than the range of the alpha particles (a few centimeters). Since the LRAD collects all ions simultaneously, an LRAD monitor is sensitive to all of the sources of contamination contained within it. The electronic noise within the LRAD can be reduced so that better sensitivity than traditional detectors is also possible. These advantages are used in the object, pipe, and duct, floor, and soil surface monitors discussed. The design of these monitors and field test results are presented.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/23.256671","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","pdfPath":"/iel1/23/6500/00256671.pdf","startPage":"840","endPage":"845","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/23.256671","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6500","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Alpha contamination monitoring of surfaces, objects, and enclosed areas","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug.  1993","displayDocTitle":"Alpha contamination monitoring of surfaces, objects, and enclosed areas","volume":"40","issue":"4","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4580501","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 1993","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/256671/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  1993","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Alpha contamination monitoring of surfaces, objects, and enclosed areas","sourcePdf":"00256671.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.046576S","chronDate":"Aug.  1993","isNumber":"6500","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"7","articleId":"256671","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":256703,"authors":[{"name":"G.

The high stopping power of the CdTe allows a high contrast image to be made using a single linac pulse for each array position.

The neural network for /sup 99m/Tc has three layers, i.e., one input layer with five units, one hidden layer with five units, and one output layer with two units. As input values to the input units, count ratios are used. They are the ratios of the counts acquired by narrow windows to the total count acquired by a broad window with the energy range from 125 to 154 keV. The outputs are a scatter count ratio and a primary count ratio. Using the primary count ratio and the total count, the primary count of the pixel is calculated directly. The neural network is trained with a backpropagation algorithm using calculated true energy spectra obtained by a Monte Carlo method. The simulation shows that an accurate estimation of primary photons is accomplished within an error ratio of 5% for primary photons.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/23.256705","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00256705.png","startPage":"1020","endPage":"1025","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","pdfPath":"/iel1/23/6500/00256705.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/23.256705","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6500","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Accurate scatter compensation using neural networks in radionuclide imaging","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Intelligent networks","Single photon emission computed tomography","Electromagnetic scattering","Particle scattering","Artificial neural networks","Energy measurement","Gamma rays","Attenuation","Educational institutions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computerised tomography","medical image processing","neural nets","patient diagnosis","radioisotope scanning and imaging","technetium"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["SPECT","single photon emission computerised tomography","scatter compensation","neural networks","radionuclide imaging","primary photons","artifical neural network","/sup 99m/Tc","input units","count ratios","narrow windows","broad window","scatter count ratio","primary count ratio","pixel","backpropagation algorithm","calculated true energy spectra","Monte Carlo method","125 to 154 keV"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/256705/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug.  1993","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  1993","displayDocTitle":"Accurate scatter compensation using neural networks in radionuclide imaging","volume":"40","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 1993","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4561649","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Accurate scatter compensation using neural networks in radionuclide imaging","sourcePdf":"00256705.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.0584S","chronDate":"Aug.  1993","isNumber":"6500","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"25","articleId":"256705","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":256708,"authors":[{"name":"W.W.

It is shown that EM algorithms based on smaller complete-data spaces will typically converge faster. Two practical applications of these concepts are discussed: the ML-IA and ML-IB image reconstruction algorithms of D.G. Politte and D.L. Snyder (1991) which are based on measurement models that account for attenuation and accidental coincidences in positron emission tomography (PET); and the problem of simultaneous estimation of emission and transmission parameters. Although the PET applications may often violate the necessary regularity conditions, the authors' analysis predicts heuristically that the ML-IB algorithm, which has a smaller complete-data space, should converge faster than ML-IA.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/23.256712","startPage":"1055","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","pdfPath":"/iel1/23/6500/00256712.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/23.256712","endPage":"1061","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6500","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On complete-data spaces for PET reconstruction algorithms","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/256712/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug.  1993","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  1993","displayDocTitle":"On complete-data spaces for PET reconstruction algorithms","volume":"40","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4561656","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Aug. 1993","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On complete-data spaces for PET reconstruction algorithms","sourcePdf":"00256712.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.051164S","chronDate":"Aug.  1993","isNumber":"6500","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"44","articleId":"256712","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":256713,"authors":[{"name":"J.

The methods are area weighted convolution (AWC), and Gaussian pixel convolution (GPC). Modulation transfer function (MTF) is used to evaluate the resolution loss, and the residual sum of squares (RSS) of the difference between the reprojected sinogram and a reference sinogram corresponding to infinite sampling is used to assess the sampling errors. The resolution loss is found to be determined by the reconstruction filter, the linear interpolation in the backprojection, and the convolution kernel. Sampling errors are found to be angle-dependent, and the angular dependency is more pronounced for the GPC. To avoid significant sampling errors, the width of the convolution kernel needs to be two times larger than the pixel distance. Large sub-binning size of the projection array leads to interpolation error, which is more pronounced for AWC than for GPC. For the GPC method, with pixel size twice the pixel distance, the sampling error can be greatly reduced. The sampling error can be reduced without additional resolution loss by using a smaller pixel distance.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/256732/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  1993","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug.  1993","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Aug. 1993","accessionNumber":"4561676","volume":"40","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Study of reprojection methods in terms of their resolution loss and sampling errors","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Study of reprojection methods in terms of their resolution loss and sampling errors","sourcePdf":"00256732.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.025606S","chronDate":"Aug.  1993","isNumber":"6500","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"15","articleId":"256732","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":256785,"authors":[{"name":"H.P.

The wave equation for the fields within the electron beam corresponds to the Appleton-Hartree magnetoionic wave modes that are of mixed electrostatic/electromagnetic polarization. Hence, the determinantal dispersion equation that is obtained implicitly includes beam space-charge effects without recourse to a heuristic model of the space-charge field.

FINE injects hardware-induced software errors and software faults into the UNIX kernel and traces the execution flow and key variables of the kernel. FINE consists of a fault injector, a software monitor, a workload generator, a controller, and several analysis utilities. Experiments on SunOS 4.1.2 are conducted by applying FINE to investigate fault propagation and to evaluate the impact of various types of faults. Fault propagation models are built for both hardware and software faults. Transient Markov reward analysis is performed to evaluate the loss of performance due to an injected fault. Experimental results show that memory and software faults usually have a very long latency, while bus and CPU faults tend to crash the system immediately. About half of the detected errors are data faults, which are detected when the system is tries to access an unauthorized memory location. Only about 8% of faults propagate to other UNIX subsystems. Markov reward analysis shows that the performance loss incurred by bus faults and CPU faults is much higher than that incurred by software and memory faults. Among software faults, the impact of pointer faults is higher than that of nonpointer faults.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/32.256857","startPage":"1105","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel1/32/6504/00256857.pdf","endPage":"1118","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6504","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/32.256857","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1993","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1993","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/256857/","displayDocTitle":"FINE: A fault injection and monitoring environment for tracing the UNIX system behavior under faults","volume":"19","issue":"11","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4609809","publicationDate":"Nov. 1993","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FINE: A fault injection and monitoring environment for tracing the UNIX system behavior under faults","sourcePdf":"00256857.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.034414S","chronDate":"Nov 1993","isNumber":"6504","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"32","citationCount":"103","articleId":"256857","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":256878,"authors":[{"name":"P.

Included are case studies of two real-time implementations: the low-delay CELP (LD-CELP) speech coder and the decoder side of the perceptual audio coder (PAC), an algorithm that compresses CD-quality audio into a 128-kb/s stream without perceptible distortion.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/35.256883","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6505","startPage":"64","endPage":"74","pdfPath":"/iel1/35/6505/00256883.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Magazine","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Magazine","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/35.256883","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Tools for real-time signal-processing research","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Signal processing algorithms","Digital signal processing","Hardware","Signal processing","Digital signal processing chips","Workstations","Testing","Erbium","Trademarks","Assembly"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["digital signal processing chips","linear predictive coding","real-time systems","signal processing equipment","speech coding","telecommunications computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code excited linear prediction","digital signal processing","real-time communication applications","DSP architecture","DSP32xx-based machines","DSP algorithm implementation","SURF-board","HoBo","DSP3","rtpi","source-code debugger","AT&T DSP32C signal-processor integrated circuit","dspx","subroutines","host programs","low-delay CELP","LD-CELP","speech coder","decoder","perceptual audio coder","PAC","CD-quality audio","128 kbit/s"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  1993","displayDocTitle":"Tools for real-time signal-processing research","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/256883/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov.  1993","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","volume":"31","issue":"11","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4580768","publicationDate":"Nov. 1993","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Tools for real-time signal-processing research","sourcePdf":"00256883.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.039874S","chronDate":"Nov.  1993","isNumber":"6505","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"35","citationCount":"3","articleId":"256883","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":256886,"authors":[{"name":"R.

It offers great promise for improving the optimization results significantly while using only a moderate amount of computing time. Tested on a suite of multi-minima optimization benchmark problems, SaPOSM's performance rivals a recently reported fast simulated diffusion method. SaPOSM was used to extract the parameters of state-of-the-art submicron (0.3- mu m channel length) MOSFET transistors, and very favorable results have been obtained. For a second difficult parameter extraction problem (18 parameters, five different channel lengths), simulation results indicate that SaPOSM achieves performance comparable to the SA method. Specifically, both SA and SaPOSM are able to minimize the modeling error to several orders of magnitude smaller than that obtained using POSM alone. At the same time, the computing time taken by SaPOSM is only a very small fraction of that taken by the SA method.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1993","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/256940/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1993","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4579593","volume":"12","issue":"10","publicationDate":"Oct. 1993","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"SaPOSM: an optimization method applied to parameter extraction of MOSFET models","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"SaPOSM: an optimization method applied to parameter extraction of MOSFET models","sourcePdf":"00256940.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.044271S","chronDate":"Oct 1993","isNumber":"6506","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","citationCount":"10","articleId":"256940","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":256956,"authors":[{"name":"S.S.

This prevents linearization and thereby places a stumbling block in the development of a transfer function which could be used in linear control analysis, as in servo applications. The work presented in this paper provides a means to accomplish this goal. This is achieved by eliminating the position-dependent terms brought about due to asymmetry by recognising a unique property of a combination of reference frames and by employing an averaging procedure. The resulting equations are shown to predict the performance of the unsymmetrical induction motor with the accuracy of the detailed equations. The stage is now set to develop accurate reduced-order models and linear transfer functions for unsymmetrical induction motors.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/60.257055","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion","pdfPath":"/iel3/60/6508/00257055.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6508","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/60.257055","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion","startPage":"425","endPage":"432","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multiple reference frame analysis of an unsymmetrical induction machine","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=257055","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Geoscience"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1993","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1993","displayDocTitle":"Multiple reference frame analysis of an unsymmetrical induction machine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/257055/","volume":"8","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 1993","accessionNumber":"4581773","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multiple reference frame analysis of an unsymmetrical induction machine","sourcePdf":"00257055.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.016978S","chronDate":"Sep 1993","isNumber":"6508","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"60","citationCount":"29","articleId":"257055","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":257070,"authors":[{"name":"Hoa Vu","affiliation":["U.S. Bureau of Reclamation, Denver, CO, USA"],"lastName":"Hoa Vu","id":"37087906808"},{"name":"J.C.

These failures occur when the insulation becomes conductive upon the initiation of an arc. In some cases, the conductive path of the carbon arc track displays a high enough resistance such that the current is limited, and therefore may be difficult to detect using conventional circuit protection. Often, such wiring failures are not simply the result of insulation failure but are due to a combination of wiring system factors. Inadequate circuit protection, unreliable system designs, and careless maintenance procedures can contribute to a wiring system failure. This paper approaches the problem with respect to the overall wiring system, in order to determine what steps can be taken to improve the reliability, maintainability, and safety of space power systems. Power system technologies, system designs, and maintenance procedures which have contributed to past wiring system failures are discussed. New technologies, design processes, and management techniques which may lead to improved wiring system safety are introduced.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/62.257135","publicationTitle":"IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel3/62/6511/00257135.pdf","startPage":"21","endPage":"27","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/62.257135","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6511","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=257135","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Assessment of safety in space power wiring systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  1994","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/257135/","displayDocTitle":"Assessment of safety in space power wiring systems","volume":"9","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 1994","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4645589","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Assessment of safety in space power wiring systems","sourcePdf":"00257135.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.037502S","chronDate":"Jan.  1994","isNumber":"6511","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"62","citationCount":"10","articleId":"257135","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":257168,"authors":[{"name":"K.H.

Filtering is performed by computing the weighted average of image values within a spatiotemporal support along the estimated motion trajectory at each pixel. The weights are determined by optimizing a well defined mathematical criterion, which provides an implicit mechanism for deemphasizing the contribution of the outlier pixels within the spatiotemporal filter support to avoid blurring. The AWA filter is therefore particularly well suited for filtering sequences that contain segments with abruptly changing scene content due to, for example, rapid zooming and changes in the view of the camera. The performance of the proposed AWA filter is compared with that of the spatiotemporal, local linear minimum mean square error (LMMSE) filtering. The results demonstrate that the proposed AWA filter-outperforms the LMMSE filter, especially in the cases of low signal-to-noise ratios and abruptly varying scene content.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive motion-compensated filtering of noisy image sequences","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","doi":"10.1109/76.257217","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","pdfPath":"/iel4/76/6513/00257217.pdf","startPage":"277","endPage":"290","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/76.257217","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6513","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=257217","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/257217/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1993","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1993","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive motion-compensated filtering of noisy image sequences","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"3","issue":"4","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Aug. 1993","accessionNumber":"4583000","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive motion-compensated filtering of noisy image sequences","sourcePdf":"00257217.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.073194S","chronDate":"Aug 1993","isNumber":"6513","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"76","citationCount":"124","articleId":"257217","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":257218,"authors":[{"name":"P.L.

It is designed to exploit properties of the human visual system (HVS), and thus yields high visual fidelity. Visual quality criteria are deliberately chosen over information-theoretic ones on the grounds that, in images intended for human viewing, visual criteria are the most meaningful ones. VPISC yields impressive compression comparable to other recent methods, such as motion-compensated vector quantization. VPISC divides the images into spatiotemporal cubes, which are then independently matched with one of a small, predetermined set of visually meaningful three-dimensional space-time patterns. The pattern set is chosen to conform to specific characteristics of the HVS. Also introduced are two modifications of VPISC: adaptive and foveal VPISC. These are spatiotemporally nonuniform implementations that code different portions of the image sequence at different resolutions, according to either a fidelity criterion (for AVPISC) or a foveation criterion (for FVPISC).<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Visual pattern image sequence coding","doi":"10.1109/76.257218","startPage":"291","endPage":"301","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/76.257218","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6513","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","pdfPath":"/iel4/76/6513/00257218.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=257218","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1993","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/257218/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1993","displayDocTitle":"Visual pattern image sequence coding","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"3","issue":"4","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 1993","accessionNumber":"4583001","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Visual pattern image sequence coding","sourcePdf":"00257218.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.040826S","chronDate":"Aug 1993","isNumber":"6513","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"76","citationCount":"19","articleId":"257218","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":257219,"authors":[{"name":"J.

Its use in the video context is rather attractive, as its application to current video broadcasting schemes, such as MUSE and HD-MAC, clearly shows. A sensible exploitation of subsampling's potential requires the systematic evaluation of the image degradation effects due to the specific subsampling lattice. Such a possibility is equivalent to the determination of all the sublattices of a given index within a lattice, a problem that can be solved, as the work shows, on the basis of the Hermite normal-form theorem.

Such ambiguities occur when the transmitted signal has small relative bandwidth. Then, for signal to noise ratios below a certain threshold, the commonly used Cramer-Rao lower bound is not realizable. The study concentrates on the region of intermediate SNR values, where the Cramer-Rao bound is no longer achievable, but useful information on time delays can still be obtained from the measurement. Realizable bounds for the single and two echo cases are obtained by deriving a new form of the Barankin (1949) bound for active time delay estimation. This form maintains the realizability property of the most general form, but is of reasonable complexity. New bounds are derived for the multiple echo case. Examples are presented to illustrate the dependence of the bound on parameters such as SNR, relative bandwidth, and echo separation.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/78.257240","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6515","startPage":"3102","endPage":"3113","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/78/6515/00257240.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Realizable lower bounds for time delay estimation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/257240/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1993","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1993","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Realizable lower bounds for time delay estimation","publicationDate":"Nov. 1993","accessionNumber":"4583007","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"41","issue":"11","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Realizable lower bounds for time delay estimation","sourcePdf":"00257240.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.038435S","chronDate":"Nov 1993","isNumber":"6515","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"38","articleId":"257240","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":257243,"authors":[{"name":"A.S.

First, the authors develop the block modified covariance algorithm (BMCA) which can be implemented either in the time or in the frequency domain-with the latter being more efficient in high-order cases. A block algorithm is also developed for the energy weighted combined forward and backward prediction. This algorithm is called energy weighted BMCA (EWBMCA) and its performance is analogous to that of the weighted covariance method proposed by Nikias and Scott (1983). Time-varying convergence factors, designed to minimize the error energy from one iteration to the next, are given for both algorithms. In addition, three updating schemes are presented, namely block-by-block, sample-by-sample, and sample-by-sample with time-scale separation. The performance of the proposed algorithms is examined with stationary and nonstationary narrowband and broadband processes, and also with sinusoids in noise. Lastly, the authors discuss the computational complexity of the proposed algorithms and give performance comparisons to existing modified covariance algorithms.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/78/6515/00257243.pdf","startPage":"3138","endPage":"3152","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/78.257243","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/78.257243","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6515","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=257243","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Block time and frequency domain modified covariance algorithms for spectral analysis","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Frequency domain analysis","Spectral analysis","Frequency estimation","Minimization methods","Algorithm design and analysis","Narrowband","Computational complexity","Forward contracts","Yield estimation","Parameter estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","convergence of numerical methods","filtering and prediction theory","frequency-domain analysis","iterative methods","parameter estimation","signal processing","spectral analysis","time-domain analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["block frequency domain modified covariance algorithms","spectral analysis","block time domain modified covariance algorithms","autoregressive parametric spectral estimation","energy weighted combined forward and backward prediction","energy weighted BMCA","EWBMCA","performance","time-varying convergence factors","error energy","iteration","block-by-block updating","sample-by-sample updating","time-scale separation","narrowband processes","broadband processes","nonstationary processes","stationary processes"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/257243/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1993","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1993","displayDocTitle":"Block time and frequency domain modified covariance algorithms for spectral analysis","volume":"41","issue":"11","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 1993","accessionNumber":"4583010","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Block time and frequency domain modified covariance algorithms for spectral analysis","sourcePdf":"00257243.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.060108S","chronDate":"Nov 1993","isNumber":"6515","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"8","articleId":"257243","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":257246,"authors":[{"name":"J.

For example, using the new technique, controllable gains in excess of 40 dB can be obtained using standard GaAs MESFET technology without reliance on device width ratioing or on early saturation. The application of the OTA design in an integrated continuous-time bandpass filter chip is presented with encouraging preliminary results.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Gain","Voltage","CMOS technology","Gallium arsenide","Active filters","Operational amplifiers","MESFETs","Band pass filters","Transconductance","Tunable circuits and devices"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["active filters","active networks","band-pass filters","field effect integrated circuits","frequency response","gain control","integrating circuits","linear integrated circuits","operational amplifiers","Schottky gate field effect transistors","tuning"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["OTA-C integrator","variable gain","bootstrap active load","voltage gain enhancement","high-voltage gain","amplifier circuits","high-frequency design","operational transconductance amplifiers","MESFET technology","high-precision filtering applications","gain stage","OTA design","integrated continuous-time bandpass filter chip","40 dB","GaAs"]}],"doi":"10.1109/81.257299","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Fundamental Theory and Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Fundamental Theory and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel4/81/6517/00257299.pdf","startPage":"440","endPage":"448","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6517","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/81.257299","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The variable gain bootstrap active load: a new approach to amplifier voltage gain enhancement and control","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=257299","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"The variable gain bootstrap active load: a new approach to amplifier voltage gain enhancement and control","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/257299/","volume":"40","issue":"7","publicationDate":"July 1993","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4589019","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul 1993","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul 1993","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The variable gain bootstrap active load: a new approach to amplifier voltage gain enhancement and control","sourcePdf":"00257299.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.041938S","chronDate":"Jul 1993","isNumber":"6517","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"81","citationCount":"2","articleId":"257299","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":257306,"authors":[{"name":"B.-R.

After reference vectors are computed using competitive learning in a stage of PSHNN, safe rejection schemes are constructed for reference vectors. The purpose of safe rejection schemes is to reject the input vectors which are hard to classify. The next stage neural network is trained with the nonlinearly transformed values of only those training vectors that were rejected in the previous stage neural network Two different kinds of safe rejection schemes, RADPN and RAD, are developed and used together. Experimental results comparing the performance of the proposed algorithms with those of backpropagation and the PSHNN with the delta rule learning algorithm are discussed. The proposed learning network produced higher classification accuracy and much faster learning. The classification accuracies of two methods for learning the reference vectors were compared. When the reference vectors are computed separately for each class (Method II), higher classification accuracy was obtained as compared to the method in which the reference vectors are computed together for all the classes (Method I). This conclusion has to do with rejection of hard vectors, and is the opposite of what is normally expected. In addition, Method II has the advantage of parallelism by which the reference vectors for all the classes can be computed simultaneously.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/82.257333","startPage":"556","endPage":"567","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Analog and Digital Signal Processing","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/82.257333","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6519","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Analog and Digital Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/82/6519/00257333.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Parallel, self-organizing, hierarchical neural networks with competitive learning and safe rejection schemes","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/257333/","displayDocTitle":"Parallel, self-organizing, hierarchical neural networks with competitive learning and safe rejection schemes","volume":"40","issue":"9","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4589029","publicationDate":"Sept. 1993","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1993","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1993","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Parallel, self-organizing, hierarchical neural networks with competitive learning and safe rejection schemes","sourcePdf":"00257333.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.040167S","chronDate":"Sep 1993","isNumber":"6519","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"82","citationCount":"18","articleId":"257333","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":257334,"authors":[{"name":"H.

In addition, few simple arithmetic operations are performed on the chip for encoding and decoding. Based on our scheme, we show a design for I-bit symbols. The proposed design requires 256*9 and 64*18-bit memory modules to process 8-bit symbols. The chip occupies a silicon area of 3.5*3.5 mm/sup 2/ using 1.2 micron CMOSN standard library cells. Compared with a known parallel implementation which requires up to 65536 PE's, the proposed architecture leads to a single PE design. It requires significantly less area than the known single PE design.

The authors deal with this theme, considering in particular multilayered feedforward nets. The study is performed on the abstract neural graphs, thus involving errors rather than faults. After an initial analysis of the error model, the effects of errors are mathematically derived and the conditions allowing the complete recovery from faults through redistribution of weights in the network (or otherwise allowing predetermined upper bounds on errors) are derived. Simulation results are presented identifying the effect of such errors on the neural computation. It is seen that (unless a good measure of redundancy is present in the net from the beginning) even single errors affect in a relevant way the computation. Correction of this effect is sought through repeated learning, i.e. an operation leading to the weight adjustment previously discussed in theoretical terms.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/CMPEUR.1991.257423","startPage":"429","endPage":"436","publicationTitle":"[1991] Proceedings, Advanced Computer Technology, Reliable Systems and Applications","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CMPEUR.1991.257423","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6520","displayPublicationTitle":"[1991] Proceedings, Advanced Computer Technology, Reliable Systems and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel2/335/6520/00257423.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fault tolerance in neural networks: theoretical analysis and simulation results","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/257423/","displayDocTitle":"Fault tolerance in neural networks: theoretical analysis and simulation results","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"4183221","publicationDate":"1991","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"13-16 May 1991","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 May 1991","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fault tolerance in neural networks: theoretical analysis and simulation results","confLoc":"Bologna, Italy","sourcePdf":"00257423.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.026054S","chronDate":"13-16 May 1991","isNumber":"6520","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"335","citationCount":"11","articleId":"257423","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":257426,"authors":[{"name":"E.N.

By providing peak rates of up to 1600 32-bit MIPS and 160 MFLOPS, the APx accelerator achieves as much as a thousandfold improvement over PC/workstations for many computationally intensive tasks.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/CMPEUR.1991.257445","pdfPath":"/iel2/335/6520/00257445.pdf","startPage":"547","endPage":"551","displayPublicationTitle":"[1991] Proceedings, Advanced Computer Technology, Reliable Systems and Applications","publicationTitle":"[1991] Proceedings, Advanced Computer Technology, Reliable Systems and Applications","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CMPEUR.1991.257445","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6520","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Neural networks simulation with array processors","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/257445/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 May 1991","displayDocTitle":"Neural networks simulation with array processors","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4188521","publicationDate":"1991","conferenceDate":"13-16 May 1991","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Neural networks simulation with array processors","confLoc":"Bologna, Italy","sourcePdf":"00257445.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048998S","chronDate":"13-16 May 1991","isNumber":"6520","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"335","articleId":"257445","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":257492,"authors":[{"name":"A.

Most robot motion planners are used off-line: the planner is invoked with a model of the environment, it produces a path which is passed to the robot controller which in turn executes it. In general, the time necessary to achieve this loop is not short enough to allow the robot to move in a dynamic environment (moving obstacles). The goal is to try to reduce this time in order to be able to deal with real time path planning in dynamic environments. The authors use a method, called 'Ariadne's CLEW algorithm', to build a global path planner based on the combination of two parallel genetic algorithms: an EXPLORE algorithm and a SEARCH algorithm. The purpose of the EXPLORE algorithm is to collect information about the environment with an increasingly fine resolution by placing landmarks in the searched space. The goal of the SEARCH algorithm is to opportunistically check if the target can be reached from any given placed landmark.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pdfPath":"/iel3/1384/6532/00257665.pdf","startPage":"7/1","endPage":"7/2","displayPublicationTitle":"IEE Colloquium on Genetic Algorithms for Control Systems Engineering","publicationTitle":"IEE Colloquium on Genetic Algorithms for Control Systems Engineering","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6532","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Designing embedded parallel systems with parallel genetic algorithms","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IET","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/257665/","chronOrPublicationDate":"28 May 1993","displayDocTitle":"Designing embedded parallel systems with parallel genetic algorithms","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4524357","publicationDate":"1993","conferenceDate":"28-28 May 1993","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Designing embedded parallel systems with parallel genetic algorithms","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"00257665.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.08335S","chronDate":"28 May 1993","isNumber":"6532","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1384","citationCount":"2","articleId":"257665","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":257666,"authors":[{"name":"C.M.

A scenario in which a planar agile target moves with intermittent maneuvers is studied. The performance comparison clearly indicates that image enhanced estimation methods are worthy of consideration in applications involving agile targets. A dual-path estimation architecture in which one path infers the likelihood of maneuver from image data is considered. These maneuver likelihoods are used to adapt the filter gains to changing conditions. Although the image-based estimator employs what appears to be an orthodox algorithm, it is less susceptible to delays in detecting a maneuver. In this architecture, the image path uses observations of target shape to change the time constants in the range-bearing path. In effect, one path modulates the other, and the tracking system is able to locate the target and discern changes in its motion pattern, so that it follows target motion more accurately. The results illustrate both the potential and the limitation of image augmentation.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/5.257679","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel1/5/6533/00257679.pdf","startPage":"797","endPage":"814","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00257679.png","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/5.257679","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6533","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Image-enhanced estimation methods","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/257679/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"June  1993","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  1993","displayDocTitle":"Image-enhanced estimation methods","volume":"81","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"June 1993","accessionNumber":"4481902","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Image-enhanced estimation methods","sourcePdf":"00257679.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.04952S","chronDate":"June  1993","isNumber":"6533","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"30","articleId":"257679","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":257683,"authors":[{"name":"J.

The problem of function approximation is one of estimating an underlying function f, given samples of the form ((y/sub i/, x/sub i/); i=1,2,...,n; with y/sub i/=f(x/sub i/)). When the dimension of the input is high and the number of samples small, estimation of the function becomes difficult due to the sparsity of samples in local regions. The authors find that this problem of high dimensionality can be overcome to some extent by using linear transformations of the input in the Gaussian kernels. Such transformations induce intrinsic dimension reduction, and can be exploited for identifying key factors of the input and for the phase space reconstruction of dynamical systems, without explicitly computing the dimension and delay. They present a generalization that uses multiple linear projections onto scalars and successive RBF networks (MLPRBF) that estimate the function based on these scaler values. They derive some key properties of RBF networks that provide suitable grounds for implementing efficient search strategies for nonconvex optimization within the same framework.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1993","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/257708/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1993","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4580584","volume":"42","issue":"10","publicationDate":"Oct. 1993","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Approximation, dimension reduction, and nonconvex optimization using linear superpositions of Gaussians","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Approximation, dimension reduction, and nonconvex optimization using linear superpositions of Gaussians","sourcePdf":"00257708.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.060348S","chronDate":"Oct 1993","isNumber":"6534","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"21","articleId":"257708","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":257712,"authors":[{"name":"S.

A normative model is developed that aggregates the individual expertise of DMs at different levels of the hierarchy. The resulting team expertise is characterized in the form of a team receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, thereby replacing the team by an equivalent single decision-making node. The normative model is tested against human teams in a laboratory experiment. The team objective is to minimize the cost of errors in the final decision at the primary DM, where the cost structure and the information structure are treated as independent variables. Discrepancies between normative predictions and experimental results are attributed to inherent limitations and cognitive biases of humans.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov/Dec 1993","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/257759/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov/Dec 1993","volume":"23","issue":"6","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Nov.-Dec. 1993","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4667104","displayDocTitle":"Distributed detection in teams with partial information: a normative-descriptive model","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distributed detection in teams with partial information: a normative-descriptive model","sourcePdf":"00257759.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.041239S","chronDate":"Nov/Dec 1993","isNumber":"6536","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"21","citationCount":"23","articleId":"257759","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":257766,"authors":[{"name":"Feng-Tse Lin","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan","Department of Applied Mathematics, Chinese Cultural University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Feng-Tse Lin","id":"37087284371"},{"name":"Cheng-Yan Kao","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Cheng-Yan Kao","id":"37085972785"},{"name":"Ching-Chi Hsu","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Ching-Chi Hsu","id":"37087147781"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9472"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2168-2909"}],"articleNumber":"257766","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":145,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":916},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Systems, Man, and Cybernetics Society","url":"http://www.ieeesmc.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=257766","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Applying the genetic approach to simulated annealing in solving some NP-hard problems","abstract":"A stochastic approach called the annealing-genetic algorithm is presented for solving some well-known combinatorial optimization problems.

The goals of efficiency in the algorithm are (1) the gap between final solution and the optimal solution should be around 3% or less, and (2) the computation time should be bounded by a polynomial function of the problem size. Empirically, the error rate of the proposed annealing-genetic algorithm for solving the multiconstraint zero-one knapsack problem is less than 1%, for solving the set partitioning problem is less than 0.1%, and for solving the traveling salesman problem is around 3%.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/21.257766","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00257766.png","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics","startPage":"1752","endPage":"1767","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/21.257766","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6536","pdfPath":"/iel1/21/6536/00257766.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Simulated annealing","Computational modeling","Genetic algorithms","NP-hard problem","Stochastic processes","Polynomials","Error analysis","Computer science","Temperature control","Temperature distribution"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["combinatorial mathematics","computational complexity","genetic algorithms","simulated annealing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["stochastic approach","annealing-genetic algorithm","simulated annealing","NP-hard problems","combinatorial optimization problems","population-based state transition","genetic-operator-based quasi-equilibrium control","Boltzmann-type selection operator","polynomial function","multiconstraint zero-one knapsack problem","set partitioning problem","traveling salesman problem"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Applying the genetic approach to simulated annealing in solving some NP-hard problems","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/257766/","volume":"23","issue":"6","accessionNumber":"4667110","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Nov.-Dec. 1993","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov/Dec 1993","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov/Dec 1993","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Applying the genetic approach to simulated annealing in solving some NP-hard problems","sourcePdf":"00257766.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.035897S","chronDate":"Nov/Dec 1993","isNumber":"6536","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"21","citationCount":"145","articleId":"257766","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":257775,"authors":[{"name":"A.

Each of these functions is evaluated with one ROM access, two additions, and one major and one minor multiplication, yielding a new result every two clock cycles. Its performance signifies an estimated three-to-four-fold increase in speed (for comparable technologies and minimum feature size) over existing approaches. Furthermore, since all four functions are performed on the same cell, a silicon-area advantage of approximately three is realized when the application demands multiple functions. In wafer scale integration (WSI) of signal and image processing algorithms, several such functions are usually needed, while defect tolerance dictates the use of just one or two types of cells. Thus the new component is ideally suited for monolithic WSI. However, it can also be used as a co-processor/accelerator for commercial DSP chips in hybrid WSI implementation of signal processing algorithms. The underlying principle, which has made the combined goals of high-speed and multifunctionality possible, is second-order interpolation of very small ROM tables.

This paper describes some of the techniques and benefits of this 3D interconnect methodology.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/257874/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1993","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1993","volume":"16","issue":"7","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 1993","accessionNumber":"4592883","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","displayDocTitle":"Future WSI technology: stacked monolithic WSI","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Future WSI technology: stacked monolithic WSI","sourcePdf":"00257874.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.053602S","chronDate":"Nov 1993","isNumber":"6539","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"33","citationCount":"16","articleId":"257874","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":257888,"authors":[{"name":"F.

The project goal here is to develop biped control strategies based on a hierarchy of simple gait oscillators, PID controllers, and neural network learning, that do not require detailed kinematic or dynamic models. While results of simulation studies using two-dimensional biped simulators have appeared previously, the focus in this article is on real-time control studies using a ten axis biped robot with foot force sensing. This ongoing study has thus far produced several preliminary results toward efficient walking. The experimental biped has learned the closed chain kinematics necessary to shift body weight from side-to-side while maintaining good foot contact, has learned the quasi-static balance required to avoid falling forward or backward while shifting body weight from side-to-side at different speeds, and has learned the dynamic balance required in order to lift a foot off of the floor for a desired length of time, during which the foot can be moved to a new location relative to the body. Using these skills, the biped is able to march in place and take short steps without falling (too often).<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/37.257893","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6540","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/37.257893","endPage":"48","publicationTitle":"IEEE Control Systems Magazine","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Control Systems Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel1/5488303/6540/00257893.pdf","startPage":"41","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Real-time neural network control of a biped walking robot","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb.  1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/257893/","displayDocTitle":"Real-time neural network control of a biped walking robot","volume":"14","issue":"1","accessionNumber":"4643298","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Feb. 1994","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Real-time neural network control of a biped walking robot","sourcePdf":"00257893.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.036126S","chronDate":"Feb.  1994","isNumber":"6540","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5488303","citationCount":"100","articleId":"257893","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":257895,"authors":[{"name":"S.

The model takes into account the pump depletion due to SRS and the different attenuation coefficients at different wavelengths of operation. It can calculate the SRS effects in any fiber, provided the Raman gain profile for that fiber is known. Thus, the model is general in nature and can be used for a number of problems. It can be used to calculate the output power of all the channels, given the input of every channel and its operating wavelength. It can also be used, at least in principle, to determine the input power level if a desired level of output power is required. Moreover, it can be used to estimate the optical amplification of a signal due to SRS. This is possible because the governing equations for all of these processes are similar and therefore can be solved using the same approach.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/50.257951","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel1/50/6542/00257951.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/50.257951","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6542","startPage":"1914","endPage":"1924","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00257951.png","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A computer model of non-dispersion-limited stimulated Raman scattering in optical fiber multiple-channel communications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=257951","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A computer model of non-dispersion-limited stimulated Raman scattering in optical fiber multiple-channel communications","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1993","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/257951/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1993","isJournal":true,"volume":"11","issue":"12","publicationDate":"Dec. 1993","accessionNumber":"4660217","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A computer model of non-dispersion-limited stimulated Raman scattering in optical fiber multiple-channel communications","sourcePdf":"00257951.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.034655S","chronDate":"Dec 1993","isNumber":"6542","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"40","articleId":"257951","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":257971,"authors":[{"name":"O.

Used as a monolithic semiconductor light source, single-mode emission with an extremely large cw tuning range of more than 50 nm is accessed. Single current step tuning spans up to 8-nm range. Several-GHz bandwidth AM and FM response is achieved. Operation as a wavelength processing device is demonstrated with data-stream transformation from short wavelength fiber windows (around 780 nm or 1310 nm) to the long wavelength window (1550 nm), as well as with ultra wide range wavelength conversion within the 1550-nm region, across +/-20 nm (blue and red shift). Optical high-speed space switching/gating functions are verified up to 1 Gb/s, and packet switching of 5-Gb/s data streams is demonstrated. Further features as a pulse reshaping device, as an electrically triggerable wavelength bistable device and as a mode locked pulse generator are addressed.

The application of a forward error controlling (FEC) scheme is a suitable means to combat the bit-error-rate (BER) degradation due to phase noise and to relax the laser linewidth requirement. In this paper, a heterodyne coherent binary phase-shift keying (BPSK) system and a heterodyne differential phase-shift keying (DPSK) system, both with a Viterbi decoded convolutional coding scheme, are investigated to illustrate the improvements of the system performance. In particular, for the first time, the use of soft decision decoding in such systems is analyzed and its advantage over hard decision decoding is demonstrated.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel1/50/6542/00257975.pdf","startPage":"2093","endPage":"2099","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","doi":"10.1109/50.257975","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/50.257975","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6542","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=257975","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Compared merits of hard/soft decoding for coherent optical communications impaired by phase noise","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Decoding","Fiber lasers","Laser noise","Semiconductor lasers","Phase noise","Degradation","Optical mixing","Optical noise","Optical fiber communication","Error correction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["coding errors","convolutional codes","decoding","error correction codes","light coherence","optical fibres","optical links","optical modulation","phase shift keying","semiconductor device noise","semiconductor lasers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["coherent optical communications","phase noise","semiconductor lasers","optical fiber communication systems","laser linewidth","forward error control","bit error rate","BER degradation","heterodyne coherent binary phase-shift keying","heterodyne coherent BPSK system","binary phase-shift keying","heterodyne DPSK system","differential phase-shift keying","Viterbi decoding","convolutional coding","system performance","soft decision decoding","hard decision decoding"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/257975/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1993","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1993","displayDocTitle":"Compared merits of hard/soft decoding for coherent optical communications impaired by phase noise","volume":"11","issue":"12","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 1993","accessionNumber":"4660241","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Compared merits of hard/soft decoding for coherent optical communications impaired by phase noise","sourcePdf":"00257975.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.035316S","chronDate":"Dec 1993","isNumber":"6542","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"2","articleId":"257975","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":257976,"authors":[{"name":"H.

The all-optical gain modulation of the TW-LDA is utilized to detect the relative phase difference between an optical signal and an optical clock The frequency response of the optical gain modulation measured with the optical heterodyne technique agrees with the theoretical results based on a rate equation model. With the developed PLL, 10-GHz optical timing clock is successfully extracted from randomly modulated optical signal pulses and the measured bit-error-rate performance shows no power penalty.

Electron Devices, vol. 39, p. 2290-98, 1992). Here, the work is extended to LDD (lightly doped drain) structures. p-MOS hot-carrier effects are examined for deep submicron structures with abrupt and LDD junctions. It is shown that, contrary to the case of n-MOS transistors, the lifetimes for hot-carrier stress of the LDD p-MOS transistors are actually shorter than their abrupt junction counterparts, in the range of LDD dopings examined here. This is explained in terms of two competing mechanisms, gate electronic injection, which decreases for the LDD junctions, and the size of the damage region in the oxide, which increases for the LDD junctions. It is concluded that using LDD-type structures for hot-carrier control does not automatically guarantee longer lifetimes.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/55.258007","publicationTitle":"IEEE Electron Device Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Electron Device Letters","pdfPath":"/iel1/55/6543/00258007.pdf","startPage":"536","endPage":"538","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/55.258007","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6543","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Anomalous hot-carrier behavior for LDD p-channel transistors","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=258007","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov.  1993","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  1993","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/258007/","displayDocTitle":"Anomalous hot-carrier behavior for LDD p-channel transistors","volume":"14","issue":"11","publicationDate":"Nov. 1993","accessionNumber":"4592912","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Anomalous hot-carrier behavior for LDD p-channel transistors","sourcePdf":"00258007.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.036003S","chronDate":"Nov.  1993","isNumber":"6543","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"55","citationCount":"6","articleId":"258007","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Letter","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":258046,"authors":[{"name":"S.

Experiments on the effects of delay on human performance are discussed, along with demonstrations of predictive displays to help the human overcome the delay. Supervisory control is shown to offer a variety of options, from switching to local impedance control upon contact with the environment to higher-level local automation. Wave transformation techniques to ameliorate the effects of delay are also described. Space teleoperations have tended to deal with the problem of time delay by avoiding it and not attempting to teleoperate from the ground. It is suggested that the US space effort might have gotten further ahead and at a lower cost with a greater is commitment to space teleoperation from the ground through the delay. Predictive display works well for free positioning. Local impedance control is recommended for control in contact with the environment, possibly accompanied by wave transformation techniques. Higher level supervisory control is always an option for sufficiently predictable tasks and will continue to improve with better sensors and task models.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/70.258052","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Robotics and Automation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Robotics and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel4/70/6545/00258052.pdf","startPage":"592","endPage":"606","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/70.258052","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6545","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Space teleoperation through time delay: review and prognosis","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/258052/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1993","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1993","displayDocTitle":"Space teleoperation through time delay: review and prognosis","volume":"9","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 1993","accessionNumber":"4656420","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Space teleoperation through time delay: review and prognosis","sourcePdf":"00258052.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.04599S","chronDate":"Oct 1993","isNumber":"6545","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"70","citationCount":"485","articleId":"258052","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":258054,"authors":[{"name":"D.A.

Nonlinear phenomena such as gearbox forward/backdrive efficiency, motor friction/stiction, and torque limiting are included. Simulations have been performed for various joint failure conditions. A scaled-down differential testbed has been designed and built to validate the analytical results.

Focusing then on iterated rational filter banks, compactly supported limit functions are obtained, in the same manner as previously done for dyadic schemes, allowing a characterization of such filter banks. These functions are carefully studied and the properties they share with the dyadic case are highlighted. They are experimentally observed to verify a \"shift property\" (strictly verified in the dyadic ease) up to an error which can be made arbitrarily small when their regularity increases. In this case, the high-pass outputs of an iterated filter bank can be very close to samples of a discrete wavelet transform with the same rational dilation factor. Straightforward extension of the formalism of multiresolution analysis is also made. Finally, it is shown that if one is ready to put up with the loss of the shift property, rational iterated filter banks can be used in the same manner as if they were dyadic filter banks, with the advantage that rational dilation factors can be chosen closer to 1.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/78.258070","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/78/6546/00258070.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/78.258070","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6546","startPage":"3232","endPage":"3244","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Iterated filter banks with rational rate changes connection with discrete wavelet transforms","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=258070","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Iterated filter banks with rational rate changes connection with discrete wavelet transforms","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1993","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/258070/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1993","isJournal":true,"volume":"41","issue":"12","publicationDate":"Dec. 1993","accessionNumber":"4672572","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Iterated filter banks with rational rate changes connection with discrete wavelet transforms","sourcePdf":"00258070.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.055321S","chronDate":"Dec 1993","isNumber":"6546","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"44","articleId":"258070","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":258071,"authors":[{"name":"A.C.

The technique utilizes the recently-popularized nonlinear energy operator Psi (s)=(s)/sup 2/-ss to isolate the AM-FM energy, and an energy separation algorithm (ESA) to extract the instantaneous amplitudes and frequencies. It is demonstrated that the performance of the energy operator/ESA approach is vastly improved if the signal is first filtered through a bank of bandpass filters, and at each instant analyzed (via Psi and the ESA) using the dominant local channel response. Moreover, it is found that uniform (worst-case) performance across the frequency spectrum is attained by using a constant-Q, or multiscale wavelet-like filter bank. The elementary stochastic properties of Psi and of the ESA are developed first. The performance of Psi and the ESA when applied to bandpass filtered versions of an AM-FM signal-plus-noise combination is then analyzed. The predicted performance is greatly improved by filtering, if the local signal frequencies occur in-band. These observations motivate the multiband energy operator and ESA approach, ensuring the in-band analysis of local AM-PM energy. In particular, the multi-bands must have the constant-Q or wavelet scaling property to ensure uniform performance across bands. The theoretical predictions and the simulation results indicate that improved practical strategies are feasible for tracking and identifying AM-FM components in signals possessing pattern coherencies manifested as local concentrations of frequencies.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/78.258071","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6546","startPage":"3245","endPage":"3265","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/78/6546/00258071.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"AM-FM energy detection and separation in noise using multiband energy operators","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/258071/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1993","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1993","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"AM-FM energy detection and separation in noise using multiband energy operators","publicationDate":"Dec. 1993","accessionNumber":"4672573","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"41","issue":"12","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"AM-FM energy detection and separation in noise using multiband energy operators","sourcePdf":"00258071.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.041821S","chronDate":"Dec 1993","isNumber":"6546","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"147","articleId":"258071","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":258072,"authors":[{"name":"B.

He obtains explicit expressions for the mean scale, scale bandwidth, instantaneous scale, and scale group delay. Furthermore, he derives expressions for mean time, mean frequency, duration, frequency bandwidth in terms of the scale variable. The short-time transform is defined and used to obtain the conditional value of scale for a given time. He shows that as the windows narrows one obtains instantaneous scale. Convolution and correlation theorems for scale are derived. A formulation is devised for studying linear scale-invariant systems. He derives joint representations of time-scale and frequency-scale, General classes for each are presented using the same methodology as for the time-frequency case. As special cases the joint distributions of Marinovich-Altes (1978, 1986) and Bertrand-Bertrand (1984) are recovered. Also, joint representations of the three quantities, time-frequency-scale are devised. A general expression for the local scale autocorrelation function is given. Uncertainty principles for scale and time and scale and frequency are derived.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/258073/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1993","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1993","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Dec. 1993","accessionNumber":"4672575","volume":"41","issue":"12","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"The scale representation","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The scale representation","sourcePdf":"00258073.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.069481S","chronDate":"Dec 1993","isNumber":"6546","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"136","articleId":"258073","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":258074,"authors":[{"name":"R.L. de Queiroz","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Texas, Arlington, Arlington, TX, USA"],"firstName":"R.L.","lastName":"de Queiroz","id":"37295015400"},{"name":"K.R.

The method is based on the construction of boundary and transition filters; these allow us to construct essentially arbitrary tilings. Time-varying modulated lapped transforms are a special case, where both boundary and overlapping solutions are possible with filters obtained by modulation. They present a double-tree algorithm which for a given signal decides on the best binary segmentation in both time and frequency. That is, it is a joint optimization of time and frequency splitting.

A constructive sampling method is proposed so that coprimeness of the transfer functions of the analysis filter banks is not only a necessary but also sufficient condition for perfect reconstruction.

This model class has some attractive characteristics which lead to extremely efficient, statistically optimal signal and image processing algorithms. The authors show that this model class is also quite rich. In particular, they describe how 1-D Markov processes and 2-D Markov random fields (MRFs) can be represented within this framework. The recursive structure of 1-D Markov processes makes them simple to analyze, and generally leads to computationally efficient algorithms for statistical inference. On the other hand, 2-D MRFs are well known to be very difficult to analyze due to their noncausal structure, and thus their use typically leads to computationally intensive algorithms for smoothing and parameter identification. In contrast, their multiscale representations are based on scale-recursive models and thus lead naturally to scale-recursive algorithms, which can be substantially more efficient computationally than those associated with MRF models. In 1-D, the multiscale representation is a generalization of the midpoint deflection construction of Brownian motion. The representation of 2-D MRFs is based on a further generalization to a \"midline\" deflection construction. The exact representations of 2-D MRFs are used to motivate a class of multiscale approximate MRF models based on one-dimensional wavelet transforms. They demonstrate the use of these latter models in the context of texture representation and, in particular, they show how they can be used as approximations for or alternatives to well-known MRF texture models.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/78.258081","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6546","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/78.258081","endPage":"3396","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/78/6546/00258081.pdf","startPage":"3377","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multiscale representations of Markov random fields","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1993","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1993","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/258081/","displayDocTitle":"Multiscale representations of Markov random fields","volume":"41","issue":"12","accessionNumber":"4672583","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Dec. 1993","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multiscale representations of Markov random fields","sourcePdf":"00258081.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.061407S","chronDate":"Dec 1993","isNumber":"6546","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"124","articleId":"258081","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":258082,"authors":[{"name":"S.G.

The wavelet transform is used in a motion compensated interframe coder in which a blockless motion compensation technique is employed to increase efficiency of wavelet transform coding. A new scanning method for wavelet coefficients is also proposed which is rather different from subband coding. Simulation work is carried out to evaluate the proposed coding method. Significant improvement in subjective quality is obtained over that obtained with conventional hybrid coding methods that use blockwise motion compensation and DCT. Some improvement has also been realized in the signal to noise ratio.

The paper considers a new approach to constant-Q TF analysis. A specific TF warping transform is applied to Cohen's class of quadratic TF representations, which results in a new class of quadratic TF representations with constant-Q characteristic. The new class is related to a \"hyperbolic TF geometry\" and is thus called the hyperbolic class (HC). Two prominent TF representations previously considered in the literature, the Bertrand P/sub 0/ distribution and the Altes-Marinovic Q-distribution, are members of the new HC. The authors show that any hyperbolic TF representation is related to both the wideband ambiguity function and a \"hyperbolic ambiguity function\". It is also shown that the HC is the class of all quadratic TF representations which are invariant to \"hyperbolic time-shifts\" and TF scalings, operations which are important in the analysis of Doppler-invariant signals and self-similar random processes. The paper discusses the definition of the HC via constant-Q warping, some signal-theoretic fundamentals of the \"hyperbolic TF geometry\", and the description of the HC by 2D kernel functions. Several members of the HC are considered, and a list of desirable properties of hyperbolic TF representations is given together with the associated kernel constraints.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Time frequency analysis","Signal analysis","Fourier transforms","Wavelet transforms","Wavelet analysis","Wideband","Signal processing","Random processes","Kernel","Frequency domain analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hyperbolic equations","signal processing","time-frequency analysis","wavelet transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hyperbolic class","quadratic time-frequency representations","constant-Q warping","hyperbolic paradigm","time-frequency version","wavelet transform","affine bilinear TF representation","affine quadratic TF representations","warping transform","HC","Bertrand P/sub 0/ distribution","Altes-Marinovic Q-distribution","wideband ambiguity function","hyperbolic ambiguity function","hyperbolic time-shifts","TF scalings","Doppler-invariant signals","self-similar random processes","desirable properties","kernel constraints"]}],"previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00258084.png","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6546","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/78.258084","startPage":"3425","endPage":"3444","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/78/6546/00258084.pdf","doi":"10.1109/78.258084","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The hyperbolic class of quadratic time-frequency representations.

The embedded code represents a sequence of binary decisions that distinguish an image from the \"null\" image. Using an embedded coding algorithm, an encoder can terminate the encoding at any point thereby allowing a target rate or target distortion metric to be met exactly. Also, given a bit stream, the decoder can cease decoding at any point in the bit stream and still produce exactly the same image that would have been encoded at the bit rate corresponding to the truncated bit stream. In addition to producing a fully embedded bit stream, the EZW consistently produces compression results that are competitive with virtually all known compression algorithms on standard test images. Yet this performance is achieved with a technique that requires absolutely no training, no pre-stored tables or codebooks, and requires no prior knowledge of the image source. The EZW algorithm is based on four key concepts: (1) a discrete wavelet transform or hierarchical subband decomposition, (2) prediction of the absence of significant information across scales by exploiting the self-similarity inherent in images, (3) entropy-coded successive-approximation quantization, and (4) universal lossless data compression which is achieved via adaptive arithmetic coding.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/78.258085","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/78/6546/00258085.pdf","startPage":"3445","endPage":"3462","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6546","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/78.258085","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Embedded image coding using zerotrees of wavelet coefficients","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=258085","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1993","displayDocTitle":"Embedded image coding using zerotrees of wavelet coefficients","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/258085/","publicationDate":"Dec. 1993","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4672587","volume":"41","issue":"12","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1993","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Embedded image coding using zerotrees of wavelet coefficients","sourcePdf":"00258085.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.044612S","chronDate":"Dec 1993","isNumber":"6546","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"3371","articleId":"258085","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-21"},{"_id":258086,"authors":[{"name":"D.

The theory of perfect-reconstruction filter banks has also been studied extensively. Nonparaunitary systems with linear phase filters have also been designed. The authors study paraunitary systems in which each individual filter in the analysis synthesis banks has linear phase. Specific instances of this problem have been addressed by other authors, and linear phase paraunitary systems have been shown to exist. This property is often desirable for several applications, particularly in image processing. They begin by answering several theoretical questions pertaining to linear phase paraunitary systems. Next, they develop a minimal factorization for a large class of such systems. This factorization will be proved to be complete for even M. Further, they structurally impose the additional condition that the filters satisfy pairwise mirror-image symmetry in the frequency domain. This significantly reduces the number of parameters to be optimized in the design process. They then demonstrate the use of these filter banks in the generation of M-band orthonormal wavelets. Several design examples are also given to validate the theory.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/78.258087","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/78/6546/00258087.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/78.258087","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6546","startPage":"3480","endPage":"3496","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Linear phase paraunitary filter banks: theory, factorizations and designs","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=258087","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Linear phase paraunitary filter banks: theory, factorizations and designs","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1993","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/258087/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1993","isJournal":true,"volume":"41","issue":"12","publicationDate":"Dec. 1993","accessionNumber":"4672589","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Linear phase paraunitary filter banks: theory, factorizations and designs","sourcePdf":"00258087.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.152506S","chronDate":"Dec 1993","isNumber":"6546","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"203","articleId":"258087","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":258088,"authors":[{"name":"P.

This paper makes three main contributions. First, it generalizes the minimal length K-regular 2-band wavelets of Daubechies (1988) to the M-band case by deriving explicit formulas for K-regular M-band scaling filters. Several equivalent characterizations of K-regularity are given and their significance explained. Second, two approaches to the construction of the (M-1) wavelet filters and associated wavelet bases are described; one relies on a state-space characterization with a novel technique to obtain the unitary wavelet filters; the other uses a factorization approach. Third, this paper gives a set of necessary and sufficient condition on the M-band scaling filter for it to generate an orthonormal wavelet basis. The conditions are very similar to those obtained by Cohen (1990) and Lawton (1990) for 2-band wavelets.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00258088.png","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/78/6546/00258088.pdf","startPage":"3497","endPage":"3511","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/78.258088","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/78.258088","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6546","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=258088","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Theory of regular M-band wavelet bases","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Filter bank","Bandwidth","Signal processing","Sufficient conditions","Signal analysis","RF signals","Radio frequency","Narrowband","Compaction","Channel bank filters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["digital filters","filtering and prediction theory","signal processing","state-space methods","wavelet transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["regular M-band wavelet bases","orthonormal M-band wavelet bases","minimal length K-regular 2-band wavelets","K-regular M-band scaling filters","sufficient condition","state-space characterization","unitary wavelet filters","necessary condition"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/258088/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1993","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1993","displayDocTitle":"Theory of regular M-band wavelet bases","volume":"41","issue":"12","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 1993","accessionNumber":"4672590","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Theory of regular M-band wavelet bases","sourcePdf":"00258088.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.068265S","chronDate":"Dec 1993","isNumber":"6546","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"225","articleId":"258088","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":258089,"authors":[{"name":"M.K.

They advocate the use of a wavelet basis because of its flexibility in capturing the signal's characteristics at different scales, and discuss how to choose the optimal wavelet basis for a given system trajectory. They also develop statistical tests to keep only the basis sequences that significantly contribute to the description of the system's time-variation. By formulating the problem as a regressor selection problem, they apply an P-test and an AIC based approach for multiresolution analysis of TV systems. The resulting algorithm can estimate TV AR or ARMAX models and determine their orders. They apply this algorithm to both synthetic and real speech data and compare it with the Kalman filtering TV parameter estimator.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/78.258089","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6546","startPage":"3512","endPage":"3523","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/78/6546/00258089.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Time-varying system identification and model validation using wavelets","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/258089/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1993","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1993","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Time-varying system identification and model validation using wavelets","publicationDate":"Dec. 1993","accessionNumber":"4672591","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"41","issue":"12","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Time-varying system identification and model validation using wavelets","sourcePdf":"00258089.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.075137S","chronDate":"Dec 1993","isNumber":"6546","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"141","articleId":"258089","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":258090,"authors":[{"name":"Xiang-Gen Xia","affiliation":["Communication Sciences Institute, Department of Electrical Engineering-Systems, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"lastName":"Xiang-Gen Xia","id":"37274950600"},{"name":"Zhen Zhang","affiliation":["Communication Sciences Institute, Department of Electrical Engineering-Systems, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"lastName":"Zhen Zhang","id":"37279639300"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1053-587X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0476"}],"articleNumber":"258090","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":86,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":598},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.signalprocessingsociety.org"}],"abstract":"The classical Shannon sampling theorem has resulted in many applications and generalizations. From a multiresolution point of view, it provides the sine scaling function. In this case, for a band-limited signal, its wavelet series transform (WST) coefficients below a certain resolution level can be exactly obtained from the samples with a sampling rate higher than the Nyquist rate. The authors study the properties of cardinal orthogonal scaling functions (COSF), which provide the standard sampling theorem in multiresolution spaces with scaling functions as interpolants. They show that COSF with compact support have and only have one possibility which is the Haar pulse. They present a family of COSF with exponential decay, which are generalizations of the Haar function. With these COSF, an application is the computation of WST coefficients of a signal by the Mallat (1989) algorithm. They present some numerical comparisons for different scaling functions to illustrate the advantage of COSF. For signals which are not in multiresolution spaces, they estimate the aliasing error in the sampling theorem by using uniform samples.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00258090.png","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/78/6546/00258090.pdf","startPage":"3524","endPage":"3535","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/78.258090","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/78.258090","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6546","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=258090","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On sampling theorem, wavelets, and wavelet transforms","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sampling methods","Wavelet transforms","Signal resolution","Signal processing","Signal sampling","Fourier transforms","Computer applications","Image processing","Image sampling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["information theory","signal processing","wavelet transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["sine scaling function","wavelets","wavelet transforms","Shannon sampling theorem","bandlimited signal","wavelet series transform","transform coefficients","sampling rate","Nyquist rate","cardinal orthogonal scaling functions","multiresolution spaces","scaling functions","Haar pulse","exponential decay","Haar function","Mallat algorithm","aliasing error","uniform samples"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/258090/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1993","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1993","displayDocTitle":"On sampling theorem, wavelets, and wavelet transforms","volume":"41","issue":"12","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 1993","accessionNumber":"4672592","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On sampling theorem, wavelets, and wavelet transforms","sourcePdf":"00258090.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.028677S","chronDate":"Dec 1993","isNumber":"6546","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"86","articleId":"258090","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":258094,"authors":[{"name":"R.G.

However, these representations are limited in that they are based on rectangular tessellations of the time-frequency plane. While much effort has gone into methods for designing nice wavelet and window functions for these frameworks, little consideration has been given to methods for constructing orthonormal bases employing nonrectangular time-frequency tilings. The authors take a first step in this direction by deriving two new families of orthonormal bases and frames employing elements that shear, or chirp, in the time-frequency plane, in addition to translate and scale. The new scale-shear fan bases and shift-shear chevron bases are obtained by operating on an existing: wavelet, Gabor (1946), or Wilson basis set with two special unitary warping transformations. In addition to the theoretical benefit of broadening the class of valid time-frequency plane tilings, these new bases could possibly also be useful for representing certain types of signals, such as chirping and dispersed signals.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Shear madness: new orthonormal bases and frames using chirp functions","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/78.258094","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/78/6546/00258094.pdf","startPage":"3543","endPage":"3549","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00258094.png","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/78.258094","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6546","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=258094","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/258094/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1993","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1993","displayDocTitle":"Shear madness: new orthonormal bases and frames using chirp functions","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"41","issue":"12","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Dec. 1993","accessionNumber":"4672595","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Shear madness: new orthonormal bases and frames using chirp functions","sourcePdf":"00258094.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.02728S","chronDate":"Dec 1993","isNumber":"6546","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"55","articleId":"258094","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":258095,"authors":[{"name":"T.

This property is used as a common strategy for the optimization of QMF banks, orthogonal wavelet transforms, and least squares pyramids. A general solution is derived for the QMF bank that provides the optimal decomposition of an arbitrary wide sense stationary process.

The stability analysis is carried out using 1-D and m-D state-space representations. The approach introduced allows one to determine the stability behavior of single-input single-output systems with overflow and quantization nonlinearities. The new criteria, based on previous stability results of digital filters with quantization schemes, are applicable to all arithmetic schemes. For the first time, results concerning general state variable representations of 1-D and m-D digital filters with the naturally occurring combination of two's complement truncation quantization and overflow are reported. Furthermore, significantly improved stability regions are obtained for digital filters with roundoff nonlinearities.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/78.258120","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/78/6547/00258120.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/78.258120","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6547","startPage":"46","endPage":"53","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00258120.png","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"New criteria for asymptotic stability of one- and multidimensional state-space digital filters in fixed-point arithmetic","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=258120","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"New criteria for asymptotic stability of one- and multidimensional state-space digital filters in fixed-point arithmetic","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/258120/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1994","isJournal":true,"volume":"42","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 1994","accessionNumber":"4646523","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"New criteria for asymptotic stability of one- and multidimensional state-space digital filters in fixed-point arithmetic","sourcePdf":"00258120.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.142702S","chronDate":"Jan 1994","isNumber":"6547","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"29","articleId":"258120","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":258122,"authors":[{"name":"T.Q.

In this approach, the prototype filter is constrained to be a linear-phase spectral-factor of a 2Mth band filter. As a result, the overall transfer function of the analysis/synthesis system is a delay. Moreover, the aliasing cancellation (AC) constraint is derived such that all the significant aliasing terms are canceled. Consequently, the aliasing level at the output is comparable to the stopband attenuation of the prototype filter. In other words, the only error at the output of the analysis/synthesis system is the aliasing error which is at the level of stopband attenuation. Using this approach, it is possible to design a pseudo-QMF bank where the stopband attenuation of the analysis (and thus synthesis) filters is on the order of /spl minus/100 dB. Moreover, the resulting reconstruction error is also on the order of /spl minus/100 dB.

Maximum likelihood estimation of the signal amplitudes and AR parameters is seen to result in a nonlinear estimation problem. However, it is shown that for a given class of signals, the use of a parameter transformation can reduce the problem to a linear least squares one. For unknown signal parameters, in addition to the signal amplitudes, the maximization can be reduced to one over the additional signal parameters. The general class of signals for which such parameter transformations are applicable, thereby reducing estimator complexity drastically, is derived. This class includes sinusoids as well as polynomials and polynomial-times-exponential signals. The ideas are based on the theory of invariant subspaces for linear operators. The results form a powerful modeling tool in signal plus noise problems and therefore find application in a large variety of statistical signal processing problems. The authors briefly discuss some applications such as spectral analysis, broadband/transient detection using line array data, and fundamental frequency estimation for periodic signals.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/78.258124","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6547","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/78.258124","endPage":"101","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00258124.png","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/78/6547/00258124.pdf","startPage":"88","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Maximum likelihood estimation of signals in autoregressive noise","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/258124/","displayDocTitle":"Maximum likelihood estimation of signals in autoregressive noise","volume":"42","issue":"1","accessionNumber":"4646527","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Jan. 1994","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Maximum likelihood estimation of signals in autoregressive noise","sourcePdf":"00258124.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.03474S","chronDate":"Jan 1994","isNumber":"6547","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"52","articleId":"258124","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":258126,"authors":[{"name":"A.K.

A number of so-called eigenvector (EV) techniques such as MUSIC, ESPRIT, WSF, and MODE have been proposed in the literature. The EV techniques for array processing require knowledge of the spatial noise correlation matrix that constitutes a significant drawback. A novel instrumental variable (IV) approach to the sensor array problem is proposed. The IV technique relies on the same basic geometric properties as the EV methods to obtain parameter estimates. However, by exploiting the temporal correlation of the source signals, no knowledge of the spatial noise covariance is required. The asymptotic properties of the IV estimator are examined and an optimal IV method is derived. Computer simulations are presented to study the properties of the IV estimators in samples of practical length. The proposed algorithm is also shown to perform better than MUSIC on a full-scale passive sonar experiment.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/78.258127","startPage":"121","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/78/6547/00258127.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/78.258127","endPage":"133","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6547","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Instrumental variable approach to array processing in spatially correlated noise fields","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/258127/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1994","displayDocTitle":"Instrumental variable approach to array processing in spatially correlated noise fields","volume":"42","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4646530","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Jan. 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Instrumental variable approach to array processing in spatially correlated noise fields","sourcePdf":"00258127.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.048974S","chronDate":"Jan 1994","isNumber":"6547","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"48","articleId":"258127","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":258128,"authors":[{"name":"R.G.

The optimization formulation for the signal-dependent kernel results in a linear program with a unique feature: a tree structure that summarizes a set of constraints on the kernel. The authors present a fast algorithm based on sorting to solve a special class of linear programs that includes the problem of interest. For a kernel with Q variables, the running time of the algorithm is O(Q log Q), which is several orders of magnitude less than any other known method for solving this class of linear program. This efficiency enables the computation of the signal-dependent, optimal-kernel time-frequency representation at a cost that is on the same order as a fixed-kernel distribution. An important property of the optimal kernel is that it takes on essentially only the values of 1 and 0.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/78.258128","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/78/6547/00258128.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/78.258128","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6547","startPage":"134","endPage":"146","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00258128.png","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A signal-dependent time-frequency representation: fast algorithm for optimal kernel design","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=258128","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A signal-dependent time-frequency representation: fast algorithm for optimal kernel design","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/258128/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1994","isJournal":true,"volume":"42","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 1994","accessionNumber":"4646531","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A signal-dependent time-frequency representation: fast algorithm for optimal kernel design","sourcePdf":"00258128.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.029605S","chronDate":"Jan 1994","isNumber":"6547","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"48","articleId":"258128","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":258129,"authors":[{"name":"B.

It is shown that a CDMA waveform is equivalent to an M-ary symbol sequence, with intersymbol interference of no more than one duration. Thus, the individual users can be jointly demodulated using the Viterbi algorithm (VA), when the amplitudes and delays are known a priori. A modified VA is developed under the assumptions that the amplitudes are unknown, and the delay estimates initialized to within half a chip. The branch metrics of the VA are approximately given by the innovations likelihoods of a bank of extended Kalman filters (EKSs). Each EKF provides an estimate of the CDMA amplitudes and delays, conditioned on a particular survivor sequence. Thus, for binary modulation and N users, 2/sup N/ EKFs and nodes in the VA trellis are required, with 2/sup N/ branches from each node. Simulation results are presented which demonstrate that the algorithm successfully estimates delays and amplitudes, given suitable initialization of the CDMA delay estimates.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A digital receiver for demodulation of CDMA waveforms with a-priori unknown delays and amplitudes","publicationTitle":"MILCOM 91 - Conference record","doi":"10.1109/MILCOM.1991.258215","displayPublicationTitle":"MILCOM 91 - Conference record","pdfPath":"/iel2/534/6548/00258215.pdf","startPage":"113","endPage":"116 vol.1","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MILCOM.1991.258215","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6548","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=258215","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/258215/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-7 Nov 1991","displayDocTitle":"A digital receiver for demodulation of CDMA waveforms with a-priori unknown delays and amplitudes","conferenceDate":"4-7 Nov. 1991","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1991","accessionNumber":"4259596","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A digital receiver for demodulation of CDMA waveforms with a-priori unknown delays and amplitudes","confLoc":"McLean, VA, USA","sourcePdf":"00258215.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.029877S","chronDate":"4-7 Nov 1991","isNumber":"6548","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"534","citationCount":"11","articleId":"258215","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":258216,"authors":[{"name":"R.L.

The ADF is developed and shown to be roughly the average probability distribution of a random process. The significance of ADF is that under most spreading modulations, the ADF is invariant. Modulation invariance suggests that a detector built around the ADF concept can be robust and general purpose. To indirectly estimate the ADF from observations, the amplitude moment statistic (AMS) is defined and used for detecting a sinusoid in stationary Gaussian noise. Detection performance is then analyzed, compared with that of a radiometer, and shown superior for small time-bandwidth products.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/MILCOM.1991.258312","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MILCOM.1991.258312","startPage":"537","endPage":"542 vol.2","displayPublicationTitle":"MILCOM 91 - Conference record","pdfPath":"/iel2/534/6548/00258312.pdf","publicationTitle":"MILCOM 91 - Conference record","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6548","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00258312.png","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The interception of spread spectrum waveforms via the amplitude distribution function","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-7 Nov 1991","displayDocTitle":"The interception of spread spectrum waveforms via the amplitude distribution function","conferenceDate":"4-7 Nov. 1991","publicationDate":"1991","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"4269354","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/258312/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The interception of spread spectrum waveforms via the amplitude distribution function","confLoc":"McLean, VA, USA","sourcePdf":"00258312.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.027781S","chronDate":"4-7 Nov 1991","isNumber":"6548","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"534","citationCount":"1","articleId":"258312","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":258319,"authors":[{"name":"J.W.

However, in the presence of significant near/far power differences, the acquisition time increases dramatically. This suggests the need for acquisition methods which explicitly account for the presence of multiple users.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/MILCOM.1991.258429","publicationTitle":"MILCOM 91 - Conference record","displayPublicationTitle":"MILCOM 91 - Conference record","pdfPath":"/iel2/534/6548/00258429.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MILCOM.1991.258429","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6548","startPage":"1042","endPage":"1046 vol.3","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Average acquisition time for SSMA channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=258429","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Average acquisition time for SSMA channels","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-7 Nov 1991","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/258429/","conferenceDate":"4-7 Nov. 1991","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1991","accessionNumber":"4264073","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Average acquisition time for SSMA channels","confLoc":"McLean, VA, USA","sourcePdf":"00258429.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.036325S","chronDate":"4-7 Nov 1991","isNumber":"6548","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"534","citationCount":"11","articleId":"258429","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":258442,"authors":[{"name":"G.

It consists of a compact feed with an elliptical subreflector which produces the required focus ring for a displaced axis parabolic reflector. The main reflector of the antenna, which weights 2.6 pounds, is made up of six lightweight petals which can be separated and nested for easy portability. Because the petals in the assembled antenna do not mate up perfectly, the aperture illumination efficiency of the antenna is reduced relative to a single-piece reflector by 0.9 dB and 0.2 dB at 44.5 GHz and 20.7 GHz, respectively. Even with this added loss, however, the efficiency of the final design is better than 53% in both frequency bands. The author discusses the considerations which led to the final antenna design, describes the antenna's mechanical configuration, and presents measured performance test results.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Reflector antennas","Aperture antennas","Dual band","Feeds","Assembly","Lighting","Frequency","Antenna measurements","Mechanical variables measurement","Testing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["military equipment","reflector antennas","satellite antennas","satellite ground stations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compact antenna","displaced axis parabolic reflector","SHF","EHF","EHF dual-frequency antenna","ASCAMP","advanced single-channel antijam man-portable","compact feed","elliptical subreflector","focus ring","aperture illumination efficiency","frequency bands","antenna design","mechanical configuration","measured performance test results","44.5 GHz","20.7 GHz","53 percent"]}],"doi":"10.1109/MILCOM.1991.258444","publicationTitle":"MILCOM 91 - Conference record","displayPublicationTitle":"MILCOM 91 - Conference record","pdfPath":"/iel2/534/6548/00258444.pdf","startPage":"1123","endPage":"1127 vol.3","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6548","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MILCOM.1991.258444","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A compact EHF dual-frequency antenna for ASCAMP","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=258444","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A compact EHF dual-frequency antenna for ASCAMP","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/258444/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1991","accessionNumber":"4274517","conferenceDate":"4-7 Nov. 1991","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-7 Nov 1991","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A compact EHF dual-frequency antenna for ASCAMP","confLoc":"McLean, VA, USA","sourcePdf":"00258444.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.039283S","chronDate":"4-7 Nov 1991","isNumber":"6548","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"534","citationCount":"2","articleId":"258444","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":258455,"authors":[{"name":"D.L.

The multiple code sequences assigned to each user are taken to be cyclic shifts of a single PN (pseudonoise) sequence. The resulting signal set is a multidimensional biorthogonal constellation. A simple receiver is presented for demodulating this signal set, and the performance of the system in the presence of multiple users is given. This uncoded system is found to have performance which is about equivalent to a two-dimensional signaling scheme with a significant amount of coding. A class of trellis codes is then given which gives an additional 3-dB coding gain (asymptotic).

The fuzzy similarity measure is a new tool to determine the degree to which two fuzzy sets are equal. The FNN is a feedforward multilayered network which integrates the basic elements and functions of a traditional fuzzy logic controller into a connectionist structure which has distributed learning abilities. The structure learning decides the proper connection types and the number of hidden units which represent fuzzy logic rules and the number of fuzzy partitions. The parameter learning adjusts the node and link parameters which represent the membership functions. The proposed supervised learning algorithm provides an efficient way of constructing a FNN in real time.

A number of issues arise in neural network research in the handling of uncertain or fuzzy information. These can be divided into several areas: input data; propagation of results through the network: and interpretation of final results. In terms of the fuzzy implementation of neural networks each area is discussed in turn, with possible approaches summarized for each. The introduction of fuzzy input causes substantial problems in most neural network learning algorithms. The learning algorithm must be able to handle interval data. A number of approaches to this problem are outlined. These fall into two main categories: (1) introduction of a preprocessor of some sort in order to handle the fuzzy input; and (2) direct modification of the learning algorithm to handle interval data.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/FUZZY.1992.258601","startPage":"93","endPage":"100","publicationTitle":"[1992 Proceedings] IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy Systems","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FUZZY.1992.258601","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6550","displayPublicationTitle":"[1992 Proceedings] IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/605/6550/00258601.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Approaches to the handling of fuzzy input data in neural networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/258601/","displayDocTitle":"Approaches to the handling of fuzzy input data in neural networks","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"4335800","publicationDate":"1992","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"8-12 March 1992","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 Mar 1992","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Approaches to the handling of fuzzy input data in neural networks","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00258601.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.09724S","chronDate":"8-12 Mar 1992","isNumber":"6550","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"605","citationCount":"12","articleId":"258601","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":258618,"authors":[{"name":"H.

Without resorting to domain experts, a fuzzy controller has to be constructed that can perform the control task of a regulator problem. The approach is based on the adaptive network, a flexible building block that can be used to implement fuzzy controllers as well as the plants under consideration. The learning rule of adaptive networks can force the plant state to approach a desired state on a time step by time step basis. The proposed approach was used to build a fuzzy controller for balancing an inverted pendulum system. It is shown that only four fuzzy if-then rules are necessary to perform the control task. The controller was quite tolerant to dealing with initial conditions that deviated significantly from the origin. The inverted pendulum system was used to test the proposed control scheme.

Compared to ordinary SMCs, fuzzy controllers (FCs) have the advantage of higher robustness. The structure of a FC is derived from a nonlinear state equation representing a large class of physical systems. The following aspects are discussed: stability conditions, scaling of the state vector, choice of the switching line, and determination of the break frequencies of the controller. By the choice of an additional boundary layer in the phase plane the FC is modified so that drastic changes of the manipulated variable can be avoided, especially at the boundary of the normalized phase plane. In this context, the higher robustness of the modified FC over the modified SMC is discussed.

The key ideas in developing this training algorithm are to view a fuzzy system as a three-layer feedforward network, and to use the chain rule to determine gradients of the output errors of the fuzzy system with respect to its design parameters. It is shown that this training algorithm performs an error backpropagation procedure: hence, the fuzzy system equipped with the backpropagation training algorithm is called the backpropagation fuzzy system (BP FS). An online initial parameter choosing method is proposed for the BP FS, and it is shown that it is straightforward to incorporate linguistic if-then rules into the BP FS. Two examples are presented which demonstrate (1) how the fuzzy system learns to match an unknown nonlinear mapping as training progresses and (2) that performance is improved by incorporating linguistic rules.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/FUZZY.1992.258711","publicationTitle":"[1992 Proceedings] IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"[1992 Proceedings] IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/605/6550/00258711.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FUZZY.1992.258711","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6550","startPage":"1409","endPage":"1418","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Back-propagation fuzzy system as nonlinear dynamic system identifiers","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=258711","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Back-propagation fuzzy system as nonlinear dynamic system identifiers","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 Mar 1992","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/258711/","conferenceDate":"8-12 March 1992","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1992","accessionNumber":"4353125","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Back-propagation fuzzy system as nonlinear dynamic system identifiers","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00258711.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.03305S","chronDate":"8-12 Mar 1992","isNumber":"6550","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"605","citationCount":"256","articleId":"258711","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":258721,"authors":[{"name":"L.-X.

The prediction error and its rate of change from each channel are computed and sent to a fuzzy logic decision output stage, which contains n+1 modules. The (n+1)th final-output module performs data fusion by combining n individual fuzzy decisions that are tuned to match the domain expert's need.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/FUZZY.1992.258764","pdfPath":"/iel5/605/6550/00258764.pdf","startPage":"813","endPage":"820","displayPublicationTitle":"[1992 Proceedings] IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy Systems","publicationTitle":"[1992 Proceedings] IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy Systems","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FUZZY.1992.258764","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6550","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Nonlinear system diagnosis using neural networks and fuzzy logic","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/258764/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 Mar 1992","displayDocTitle":"Nonlinear system diagnosis using neural networks and fuzzy logic","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4362698","publicationDate":"1992","conferenceDate":"8-12 March 1992","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Nonlinear system diagnosis using neural networks and fuzzy logic","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00258764.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.031538S","chronDate":"8-12 Mar 1992","isNumber":"6550","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"605","citationCount":"4","articleId":"258764","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":258778,"authors":[{"name":"T.

The measurements were performed by sensors set on an array of the tip of a five axis manipulator. The sensor array is carried to the target surface by moving the manipulator. The manipulator approaches the surface by using sensor outputs. To approach the work fast, the system should use long measurement range sensors. For precise cutting and a fast approach, the system should use both high accuracy sensors and long measurement range sensors. To use these sensors effectively, the multi-sensor integration system was based on neural network and fuzzy inference techniques. As a result, the system can consider the angle between the sensors and the object.

By reconstructing in one single slice all lines of response defined by two adjacent rings of detectors, a fourfold increase in the number of coincidence lines is obtained and a uniform sampling distance equal to one quarter the interdetector spacing is achieved. Whereas this is obtained at the expense of a 100% degradation of the resolution in the axial direction, with the recent breed of PET (positron emission tomography) scanners using nearly square cross section detectors the resolution loss is tolerable; in addition, normal reconstruction of the individual coincidence planes is always possible.

However, since these measurements are typically corrupted by Poisson counting noise, they propagate additional uncertainty into reconstructed images and kinetic parameter estimates. This can be especially true in the thorax where the attenuating medium is heterogeneous and the statistical precision of the transmission scan may be approximately the same as that of the emission data. To account for the Poisson noise in the transmission measurement, the authors have developed a sieve-constrained maximum likelihood algorithm that jointly estimates both the survival probability and the emission intensity.

The network has 121 input nodes and one output node. A backpropagation algorithm with a sigmoid activation function is used for its supervised learning. The diagnostic performance of the neural network is studied at various noise levels for different numbers of training images using receiver operating characteristics analysis. Three noise levels (30000, 50000, and 100000 counts/slice) were used. At each noise level two training data sets (one with 40 and one with 200 simulated SPECT images) and a testing data set (200 SPECT images unknown to the trained network) were generated. The diagnostic task was the detection of a cold lesion 1.0 cm in radius at a known location of the image. The neural network trained quickly and accurately in all cases. Network convergence to a minimum in cumulative squared error was easy to achieve regardless of the noise level or the number of training images. However, the performance of the network as a decision maker for lesion detection on new images was very much affected by the number of training images. When trained with a sufficiently large number of images the performance of the network was significantly improved, particularly in the low count (high noise) case.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/NSSMIC.1991.259305","startPage":"2179","endPage":"2183 vol.3","displayPublicationTitle":"Conference Record of the 1991 IEEE Nuclear Science Symposium and Medical Imaging Conference","pdfPath":"/iel2/623/6551/00259305.pdf","publicationTitle":"Conference Record of the 1991 IEEE Nuclear Science Symposium and Medical Imaging Conference","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NSSMIC.1991.259305","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6551","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Application of neural networks to lesion detection in SPECT","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Lesions","Noise level","Artificial neural networks","Feedforward neural networks","Single photon emission computed tomography","Computer networks","Optical computing","Backpropagation algorithms","Supervised learning"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computerised tomography","feedforward neural nets","medical image processing","radioisotope scanning and imaging"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["single-layer feedforward neural network","nuclear medicine","single photon emission computerised tomography","network convergence","medical diagnostic imaging","lesion detection","input nodes","output node","backpropagation algorithm","sigmoid activation function","supervised learning","diagnostic performance","receiver operating characteristics analysis","cold lesion","cumulative squared error","training images","2 cm"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/259305/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-9 Nov. 1991","displayDocTitle":"Application of neural networks to lesion detection in SPECT","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1991","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"2-9 Nov. 1991","accessionNumber":"4467649","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Application of neural networks to lesion detection in SPECT","confLoc":"Santa Fe, NM, USA","sourcePdf":"00259305.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061078S","chronDate":"2-9 Nov. 1991","isNumber":"6551","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"623","citationCount":"1","articleId":"259305","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":259306,"authors":[{"name":"C.E.

In-plane and interslice filtering are accomplished separately in order to decrease the complexity of this initial neural network experiment. This particular procedure utilized supervised training with the modified delta rule that minimized the mean-squared error through a gradient descent. The in-slice filtering problem was to test if the network could learn the ramp filter for a cone beam geometry. This study used simulated Monte Carlo data that represented a geometry of a point source located off the axis of rotation. Though preliminary data were promising, it was not possible to determine a general axial filter. This is due to insufficient sampling in the axial direction by the cone beam geometry.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-9 Nov. 1991","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/259307/","accessionNumber":"4467651","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1991","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"2-9 Nov. 1991","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Cone beam filtering using artificial neural networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cone beam filtering using artificial neural networks","confLoc":"Santa Fe, NM, USA","sourcePdf":"00259307.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.076783S","chronDate":"2-9 Nov. 1991","isNumber":"6551","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"623","citationCount":"1","articleId":"259307","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":259398,"authors":[{"name":"Pao-Lo Liu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, State University of New York, University at Buffalo, Buffalo, NY, USA"],"lastName":"Pao-Lo Liu","id":"37348007100"},{"name":"B.J.

Specifically, the field intensity at full width half maximum (FWHM) considered as a function of the group velocity mismatch between incident pulses, and also as a function of the mismatch between the generated pulse and one of the incident pulses, is analyzed by numerical and asymptotic techniques. Both mismatch types are allowed to be arbitrary. The FWHM intensity of the sum frequency field refers here to a cross-correlation measurement between pulses separated by a time delay to tau , where the FWHM is formed with respect to varying tau , rather than to the time-based FWHM of a sum-frequency-generated light pulse for a fixed tau . It is shown that the FWHM is fundamentally insensitive to mismatch between generated and incident fields, thus providing a justification for ignoring this term.

The maximum acceptable probability of failure for these applications ranges from about 10/sup /spl minus/4/ to 10/sup /spl minus/10/ per hour depending on whether it is a military or civil application. Typical examples include commercial and military aircraft fly-by-wire, full authority engine control, satellite and launch vehicle control, ground transport vehicles, etc. Realtime response requirements for these applications are also very demanding, with correct control inputs required every 10 to 100 ms, depending on the application. These dual goals of ultrahigh reliability and real-time response necessitate computer systems that are quite different from other dependable systems in their architecture, design and development methodology, validation and verification, and operational philosophy. This paper highlights these differences by describing each of these aspects of safety-critical systems. Architectural principles and techniques to address these unique requirements are described.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/5.259424","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel1/5/6554/00259424.pdf","startPage":"25","endPage":"40","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/5.259424","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6554","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Architectural principles for safety-critical real-time applications","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/259424/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  1994","displayDocTitle":"Architectural principles for safety-critical real-time applications","volume":"82","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 1994","accessionNumber":"4646680","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Architectural principles for safety-critical real-time applications","sourcePdf":"00259424.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.040483S","chronDate":"Jan.  1994","isNumber":"6554","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"137","articleId":"259424","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":259426,"authors":[{"name":"K.

Given the vast amount of work that has been done by both the operations research and computer science communities in the scheduling area, we discuss four paradigms underlying the scheduling approaches and present several exemplars of each. The four paradigms are: static table-driven scheduling, static priority preemptive scheduling, dynamic planning-based scheduling, and dynamic best effort scheduling. In the operating system context, we argue that most of the proprietary commercial kernels as well as real-time extensions to time-sharing operating system kernels do not fit the needs of predictable realtime systems. We discuss several research kernels that are currently being built to explicitly meet the needs of real-time applications.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/5.259426","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel1/5/6554/00259426.pdf","startPage":"55","endPage":"67","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00259426.png","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/5.259426","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6554","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Scheduling algorithms and operating systems support for real-time systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=259426","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/259426/","displayDocTitle":"Scheduling algorithms and operating systems support for real-time systems","volume":"82","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 1994","accessionNumber":"4646690","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Scheduling algorithms and operating systems support for real-time systems","sourcePdf":"00259426.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.05674S","chronDate":"Jan.  1994","isNumber":"6554","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"230","articleId":"259426","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":259427,"authors":[{"name":"Lui Sha","affiliation":["Software Engineering Institute, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA, USA"],"lastName":"Lui Sha","id":"37279656500"},{"name":"R.

While transaction response time and throughput are usually used to measure a conventional database system, the percentage of transactions satisfying the deadlines or a time-critical value function is often used to evaluate a real-time database system. Scheduling real-time transactions is far more complex than traditional real-time scheduling in the sense that (1) worst case execution times are typically hard to estimate, since not only CPU but also I/O requirement is involved; and (2) certain aspects of concurrency control may not integrate well with real-time scheduling. In this paper, we first develop a taxonomy of the underlying design space of concurrency control including the various techniques for achieving serializability and improving performance. This taxonomy provides us with a foundation for addressing the real-time issues. We then consider the integration of concurrency control with real-time requirements. The implications of using run policies to better utilize real-time scheduling in a database environment are examined. Finally, as timing constraints may be more important than data consistency in certain hard realtime database applications, we also discuss several approaches that explore the nonserializable semantics of real-time transactions to meet the hard deadlines.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/5.259432","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel1/5/6554/00259432.pdf","startPage":"140","endPage":"157","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/5.259432","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6554","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On real-time databases: concurrency control and scheduling","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=259432","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/259432/","displayDocTitle":"On real-time databases: concurrency control and scheduling","volume":"82","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 1994","accessionNumber":"4646686","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On real-time databases: concurrency control and scheduling","sourcePdf":"00259432.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.124629S","chronDate":"Jan.  1994","isNumber":"6554","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"96","articleId":"259432","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-27"},{"_id":259484,"authors":[{"name":"B.

The authors have previously proposed a unified performance analysis based on a finite amount of data and achieved a tractable expression for the mean-squared DOA estimation error for the multiple signal classification (MUSIC). Min-Norm, estimation of signal parameters using rotational invariance techniques (ESPRIT), and state-space realization algorithms. However, this expression uses the singular values and vectors of a data matrix, which are obtained by the highly nonlinear transformation of the singular value decomposition (SVD). Thus the effects of the original data parameters such as numbers of sensors and snapshots, source coherence and separations were not explicitly analyzed. The authors unify and simplify this previous result and derive a unified expression based on the original data parameters.

The results are particularly interesting for spread-spectrum positioning systems like Global Positioning System (GPS) and GLONASS.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/7.259541","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems","pdfPath":"/iel4/7/6556/00259541.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/7.259541","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6556","startPage":"1359","endPage":"1365","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Spread-spectrum code and carrier synchronization errors caused by multipath and interference","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=259541","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Spread-spectrum code and carrier synchronization errors caused by multipath and interference","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1993","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/259541/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1993","isJournal":true,"volume":"29","issue":"4","publicationDate":"Oct. 1993","accessionNumber":"4587187","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spread-spectrum code and carrier synchronization errors caused by multipath and interference","sourcePdf":"00259541.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.048804S","chronDate":"Oct 1993","isNumber":"6556","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7","citationCount":"83","articleId":"259541","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":259600,"authors":[{"name":"R.

Such single-frequency networks (SFNs) have the potential of providing good coverage and very good frequency economy in wide-area (nationwide) applications. An OFDM-based SFN is analyzed with respect to its coverage properties. The network performance is measured by the outage probability and frequency economy. Both wide and local area systems are considered. Results show that in wide-area networks, very low outage probabilities may be achieved with very modest transmitter powers. The main reason for this is the inherent diversity, the efficiency is of which is primarily dependent on the transmitter density. However, in local area systems with only a few transmitters in each region, the performance is shown to drop drastically, mainly due to the low degree of diversity. This work implies that good network planning results in low-power, closely spaced transmitters.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6558","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Broadcasting","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Broadcasting","pdfPath":"/iel1/11/6558/00259600.pdf","doi":"10.1109/11.259600","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/11.259600","startPage":"395","endPage":"401","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the outage probability in single frequency networks for digital broadcasting","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1993","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1993","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/259600/","displayDocTitle":"On the outage probability in single frequency networks for digital broadcasting","isJournal":true,"volume":"39","issue":"4","accessionNumber":"4655122","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Dec. 1993","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the outage probability in single frequency networks for digital broadcasting","sourcePdf":"00259600.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.017885S","chronDate":"Dec 1993","isNumber":"6558","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"11","citationCount":"48","articleId":"259600","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":259614,"authors":[{"name":"R.A.

Temperature rises in excess of 100 K are observed for SOI devices under static operating conditions. The measured temperature rise agrees well with the predictions of an analytical model and is a function of the silicon thickness, buried oxide thickness, and channel-metal contact separation. Under dynamic circuit conditions, the channel temperatures are much lower than predicted from the static power dissipation. This work provides the foundation for the extraction of device modeling parameters for dynamic operation (at constant temperature) from static device characterization data (where temperature varies widely). Self-heating does not greatly reduce the electromigration reliability of SOI circuits, but might influence SOI device design, e.g., requiring a thinner buried oxide layer for particular applications and scaled geometries.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/16.259622","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6559","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/16.259622","endPage":"75","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","pdfPath":"/iel1/16/6559/00259622.pdf","startPage":"69","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Measurement and modeling of self-heating in SOI nMOSFET's","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/259622/","displayDocTitle":"Measurement and modeling of self-heating in SOI nMOSFET's","volume":"41","issue":"1","accessionNumber":"4644627","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Jan. 1994","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Measurement and modeling of self-heating in SOI nMOSFET's","sourcePdf":"00259622.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.032708S","chronDate":"Jan 1994","isNumber":"6559","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"278","articleId":"259622","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":259625,"authors":[{"name":"S.

Metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistors (MOSFET's) with SiGe channels are guided by different design rules than state-of-the-art silicon MOSFET's. The selection of the transistor gate material, the optimization of the silicon-germanium channel profile, the method of threshold voltage adjustment, and the silicon-cap and gate-oxide thickness sensitivities are the critical design parameters for the p-channel SiGe MOSFET. Two-dimensional numerical modeling demonstrates that n/sup +/ polysilicon-gate SiGe p-MOSFET's have acceptable short-channel behavior at 0.20 /spl mu/m channel lengths and are preferable to p/sup +/ polysilicon-gate p-MOSFET's for 2.5 V operation. Experimental results of n/sup +/-gate modulation-doped SiGe p-MOSFET's illustrate the importance of the optimization of the SiGe-channel profile.

A group code has a well-defined state space Sigma /sub k/ at each time k. Each code sequence passes through a well-defined state sequence. The set of all state sequences is also a group code, the state code of C. The state code defines an essentially unique minimal realization of C. The trellis diagram of C is defined by the state code of C and by labels associated with each state transition. The set of all label sequences forms a group code, the label code of C, which is isomorphic to the state code of C. If C is complete and strongly controllable, then a minimal encoder in controller canonical (feedbackfree) form may be constructed from certain sets of shortest possible code sequences, called granules. The size of the state space Sigma /sub k/ is equal to the size of the state space of this canonical encoder, which is given by a decomposition of the input groups of C at each time k. If C is time-invariant and nu -controllable, then mod Sigma /sub k/ mod = Pi /sub 1<or=j<or=v/ mod F/sub j//F/sub j-1/ mod /sup j/, where F/sub 0/ contained in ... contained in F nu is a normal series, the input chain of C. A group code C has a well-defined trellis section corresponding to any finite interval, regardless of whether it is complete. For a linear time-invariant convolutional code over a field G, these results reduce to known results; however, they depend only on elementary group properties, not on the multiplicative structure of G. Moreover, time-invariance is not required. These results hold for arbitrary groups, and apply to block codes, lattices, time-varying convolutional codes, trellis codes, geometrically uniform codes and discrete-time linear systems.<<ETX>>","doi":"10.1109/18.259635","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel1/18/6560/00259635.pdf","startPage":"1491","endPage":"1513","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6560","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/18.259635","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The dynamics of group codes: state spaces, trellis diagrams, and canonical encoders","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=259635","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1993","displayDocTitle":"The dynamics of group codes: state spaces, trellis diagrams, and canonical encoders","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/259635/","publicationDate":"Sept. 1993","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4627385","volume":"39","issue":"5","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1993","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The dynamics of group codes: state spaces, trellis diagrams, and canonical encoders","sourcePdf":"00259635.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.076073S","chronDate":"Sep 1993","isNumber":"6560","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"174","articleId":"259635","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":259636,"authors":[{"name":"Y.S.

The approach used here converts the decoding problem into a search problem through a graph that is a trellis for an equivalent code of the transmitted code. A generalized Dijkstra's algorithm, which uses a priority-first search strategy, is employed to search through this graph. This search is guided by an evaluation function f defined to take advantage of the information provided by the received vector and the inherent properties of the transmitted code. This function f is used to reduce drastically the search space and to make the decoding efforts of this decoding algorithm adaptable to the noise level. For example, for most real channels of the 35 000 samples tried, simulation results for the (128,64) binary extended BCH code show that the proposed decoding algorithm is fifteen orders of magnitude more efficient in time and in space than that proposed by Wolf (1978). Simulation results for the (104, 52) binary extended quadratic residue code are also given.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/18.259636","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6560","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/18.259636","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel1/18/6560/00259636.pdf","startPage":"1514","endPage":"1523","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient priority-first search maximum-likelihood soft-decision decoding of linear block codes","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1993","displayDocTitle":"Efficient priority-first search maximum-likelihood soft-decision decoding of linear block codes","volume":"39","issue":"5","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1993","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 1993","accessionNumber":"4627386","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/259636/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient priority-first search maximum-likelihood soft-decision decoding of linear block codes","sourcePdf":"00259636.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.043415S","chronDate":"Sep 1993","isNumber":"6560","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"89","articleId":"259636","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":259637,"authors":[{"name":"O.

On the other hand, there are few other bounds suitable for general cyclic codes. Therefore, research Problem 9.9 of MacWilliams and Sloane (1977), The Theory of Error-Correcting Codes, asks if the bound of Deligne (1974) for exponential sums in several variables or the bound of Lang and Weil (1954), can be used to obtain bounds on the minimum distance of codes. This question is answered in the affirmative by showing how Deligne's theorem can be made to yield a lower bound on the minimum distance of certain classes of cyclic codes. In the process, an infinite family of binary cyclic codes is presented for which the bound on minimum distance so derived is as tight as possible. In addition, an infinite family of polynomials of degree 3 in 2 variables over a field of characteristic 2, for which Deligne's bound is tight, is exhibited. Finally, a bound is presented for the minimum distance of the duals of the binary subfield subcodes of generalized Reed-Muller codes as well as for the corresponding cyclic codes. It is noted that these codes contain examples of the best binary cyclic codes.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/18.259637","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/18.259637","startPage":"1524","endPage":"1534","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel1/18/6560/00259637.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6560","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Minimum distance bounds for cyclic codes and Deligne's theorem","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/259637/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1993","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1993","displayDocTitle":"Minimum distance bounds for cyclic codes and Deligne's theorem","volume":"39","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4627387","publicationDate":"Sept. 1993","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Minimum distance bounds for cyclic codes and Deligne's theorem","sourcePdf":"00259637.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.045858S","chronDate":"Sep 1993","isNumber":"6560","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"20","articleId":"259637","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":259642,"authors":[{"name":"M.R.

The target impulse response is introduced to model target scattering behavior. Two radar waveform design problems with constraints on waveform energy and duration are then solved. In the first, a deterministic target impulse response is used to design waveform/receiver-filter pairs for the optimal detection of extended targets in additive noise. In the second, a random target impulse response is used to design waveforms that maximize the mutual information between a target ensemble and the received signal in additive Gaussian noise. The two solutions are contrasted to show the difference between the characteristics of waveforms for extended target detection and information extraction. The optimal target detection solution places as much energy as possible in the largest target scattering mode under the imposed constraints on waveform duration and energy. The optimal information extraction solution distributes the energy among the target scattering modes in order to maximize the mutual information between the target ensemble and the received radar waveform.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/18.259642","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6560","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/18.259642","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel1/18/6560/00259642.pdf","startPage":"1578","endPage":"1597","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Information theory and radar waveform design","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1993","displayDocTitle":"Information theory and radar waveform design","volume":"39","issue":"5","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1993","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 1993","accessionNumber":"4627392","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/259642/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Information theory and radar waveform design","sourcePdf":"00259642.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.029495S","chronDate":"Sep 1993","isNumber":"6560","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"486","articleId":"259642","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":259644,"authors":[{"name":"M.

Person P/sub x/ knows X, Person P/sub y/ knows Y, and both know the underlying probability distribution of the random pair (X, Y). Using a predetermined protocol, they exchange messages over a binary, error-free, channel in order for P/sub y/ to learn X. P/sub x/ may or may not learn Y. C/sub m/ is the number of information bits that must be transmitted (by both persons) in the worst case if only m messages are allowed. C/sub infinity / is the corresponding number of bits when there is no restriction on the number of messages exchanged. We consider three aspects of this problem. C/sub 4/. It is known that one-message communication may require exponentially more bits than the minimum possible: for some random pairs, C/sub 1/=2/sup C infinity -1/. Yet just two messages suffice to reduce communication to almost the minimum: for all random pairs, C/sub 2/<or=4C/sub infinity /+3. We show that, asymptotically, four messages require at most three times the minimum number of bits: for all random pairs, C/sub 4/<or=3C/sub infinity /+o(C/sub infinity /). Balanced pairs. Let mu be the maximum number of X values possible with a given Y value, and let eta be the maximum number of Y values possible with a given X value. A random pair is balanced if mu = eta . It is known that for all balanced pairs, three messages require at most log mu +o(log mu ) bits, hence are asymptotically optimum. It was not known whether two messages are asymptotically optimum. We show that for every c and positive E there is a balanced pair such that C/sub 2/>or=(2- in )C/sub infinity />or=c. Asymptotically, this is the largest possible discrepancy. Amortized complexity. The amortized complexity of (X,Y) is the limit, as k grows, of the number of bits required in the worst case for L independent repetitions of (X, Y), normalized by k. We show that the four-message amortized complexity of all random pairs is exactly log mu . Hence, when a random pair is repeated many times, no bits can be saved if P/sub x/ knows Y in advance.<<ETX>>","doi":"10.1109/18.259644","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","startPage":"1608","endPage":"1615","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel1/18/6560/00259644.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/18.259644","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6560","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Three results on interactive communication","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Protocols","Random variables","Probability distribution","Data compression","Information theory","Computer science","Computer errors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["communication complexity","information theory","probability","protocols","telecommunication channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["interactive communication","random variables.","probability distribution","random pair","predetermined protocol","balanced pairs","asymptotically optimum messages","amortized complexity","communication complexity","binary error-free channel"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1993","displayDocTitle":"Three results on interactive communication","volume":"39","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4627394","publicationDate":"Sept. 1993","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1993","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/259644/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Three results on interactive communication","sourcePdf":"00259644.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.03299S","chronDate":"Sep 1993","isNumber":"6560","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"17","articleId":"259644","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":259647,"authors":[{"name":"A.J.

As with other known public key schemes, such as RSA and discrete exponentiation in a finite field, some care must be exercised when selecting the parameters involved, in this case the elliptic curve and the underlying field. Specific classes of curves that give little or no advantage over previously known schemes are discussed. The main result of the paper is to demonstrate the reduction of the elliptic curve logarithm problem to the logarithm problem in the multiplicative group of an extension of the underlying finite field. For the class of supersingular elliptic curves, the reduction takes probabilistic polynomial time, thus providing a probabilistic subexponential time algorithm for the former problem.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/18.259647","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel1/18/6560/00259647.pdf","startPage":"1639","endPage":"1646","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/18.259647","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6560","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reducing elliptic curve logarithms to logarithms in a finite field","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/259647/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1993","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1993","displayDocTitle":"Reducing elliptic curve logarithms to logarithms in a finite field","volume":"39","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 1993","accessionNumber":"4627397","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reducing elliptic curve logarithms to logarithms in a finite field","sourcePdf":"00259647.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.032399S","chronDate":"Sep 1993","isNumber":"6560","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"576","articleId":"259647","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":259648,"authors":[{"name":"W.

This finding was used to obtain several insights into certain universal data compression schemes, most notably the Lempel-Ziv data compression algorithm. Wyner and Ziv have also conjectured that their result can be extended to a stronger almost sure convergence. In this paper, we settle this conjecture in the negative in the so called right domain asymptotic, that is, during a dynamic phase of expanding the data base. We prove-under an additional assumption involving mixing conditions-that the length of a typical repeated subword oscillates almost surely (a.s.) between (1/h/sub 1/)log n and (1/h/sub 2/)log n where D<h/sub 2/<h<or=h/sub 1/< infinity . We also show that the length of the nth block in the Lempel-Ziv parsing algorithm reveals a similar behavior. We relate our findings to some problems on digital trees, namely the asymptotic behavior of a (noncompact) suffix tree built from suffixes of a random sequence. We prove that the height and the shortest feasible path in a suffix tree are typically (1/h/sub 2/)log n (a.s.) and (1/h/sub 1/)log n (a.s.) respectively.<<ETX>>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel1/18/6560/00259648.pdf","startPage":"1647","endPage":"1659","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","doi":"10.1109/18.259648","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/18.259648","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6560","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=259648","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Asymptotic properties of data compression and suffix trees","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Data compression","Algorithm design and analysis","Computer science","Pattern matching","Entropy","Convergence","Hydrogen","Random sequences","Face detection","Codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["convergence","data compression","entropy","information theory","probability","trees (mathematics)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data compression","suffix trees","repeated subword","stationary ergodic sequence","probability","alphabet entropy","universal data compression","almost sure convergence","right domain asymptotic","mixing conditions","Lempel-Ziv parsing algorithm","digital trees","random sequence","shortest feasible path"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/259648/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1993","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1993","displayDocTitle":"Asymptotic properties of data compression and suffix trees","volume":"39","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 1993","accessionNumber":"4627398","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Asymptotic properties of data compression and suffix trees","sourcePdf":"00259648.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.05235S","chronDate":"Sep 1993","isNumber":"6560","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"44","articleId":"259648","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":259652,"authors":[{"name":"Zhen Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering-Systems, Communication Sciences Institute, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"lastName":"Zhen Zhang","id":"37279639300"},{"name":"Chungming Tu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering-Systems, Communication Sciences Institute, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"lastName":"Chungming Tu","id":"37365206100"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9448"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9654"}],"articleNumber":"259652","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":29},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Information Theory Society","url":"http://www.itsoc.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=259652","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Tail","Parity check codes","Encoding","Decoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["binary sequences","encoding","error correction codes","error detection codes","redundancy"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["systematic tEC/AUED codes","upper bound","redundancy","code construction","error correcting codes","t-error correcting/all unidirectional error detecting codes","partitioning of binary vectors"]}],"abstract":"A new approach for the construction of systematic tEC/AUED codes is presented.

A method for constructing codes that achieve error-free M-Choose-T communication over the noiseless adder channel (AC), at a nominal rate of 1/T bits per channel symbol per active user, is described and an efficient decoding procedure is presented. The use of such codes is referred to as forward collision resolution (FCR), as it enables correct decoding of collided messages without retransmissions. For any given T a code is available that yields a stable throughput arbitrarily close to 1 message/slot. Furthermore, if the occurrence of collisions is made known to the transmitters, such a throughput can be maintained for arbitrary T,T<or=M as well. If such feedback is not available, and T is random, the probability of an unresolved collision is significantly smaller than the probability of a collision in an uncoded system, at comparable message-arrival and information rates.<<ETX>>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Feedback","Decoding","Throughput","Transmitters","Read only memory","Active noise reduction","Information rates","Conferences","Multiuser channels","Interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decoding","encoding","error correction codes","multi-access systems","telecommunication channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["forward collision resolution","random multiple-access","M-Choose-T communication","code construction","noiseless adder channel","error-free communication","decoding procedure","collided messages","stable throughput"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=259654","doi":"10.1109/18.259654","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel1/18/6560/00259654.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/18.259654","startPage":"1671","endPage":"1675","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6560","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Forward collision resolution-a technique for random multiple-access to the adder channel","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Forward collision resolution-a technique for random multiple-access to the adder channel","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/259654/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1993","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1993","volume":"39","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Sept. 1993","accessionNumber":"4627402","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Forward collision resolution-a technique for random multiple-access to the adder channel","sourcePdf":"00259654.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.028473S","chronDate":"Sep 1993","isNumber":"6560","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"16","articleId":"259654","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":259655,"authors":[{"name":"J.S.

The bound is applicable to biased estimates' of functions of a multidimensional parameter. Termed the hybrid Bhattacharyya-Barankin bound, it may be written as the sum of the mth-order Bhattacharyya bound and a nonnegative term similar in form to the rth-order Hammersley-Chapman-Robbins bound. It is intended for use when small-error bounds, such as the Cramer-Rao bound, may not be tight; unlike many large-error bounds, it provides a smooth transition between the small-error and large-error regions. As an example application, bounds are placed on the variance of unbiased position estimates derived from passive array measurements. Here, the hybrid Bhattacharyya-Barankin bound enters the large-error region at a larger SNR and, in the large-error region, is noticeably greater than either the Hammersley-Chapman-Robbins or the Bhattacharyya bounds.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/18.259655","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel1/18/6560/00259655.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/18.259655","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6560","startPage":"1675","endPage":"1680","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A bound on mean-square-estimate error","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=259655","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A bound on mean-square-estimate error","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1993","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/259655/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1993","isJournal":true,"volume":"39","issue":"5","publicationDate":"Sept. 1993","accessionNumber":"4627403","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A bound on mean-square-estimate error","sourcePdf":"00259655.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.036985S","chronDate":"Sep 1993","isNumber":"6560","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"69","articleId":"259655","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":259656,"authors":[{"name":"B.D.

These codes are a generalization of the usual run-length-limited (d, k) codes and provide for increased storage density by relaxing the k-constraint and encoding multiple tracks in parallel. This paper introduces a method to construct multitrack (d, k) block codes which are implemented via an enumeration scheme based on the trellis description of the (d, k) constraints. This implementation results in memory requirements which increase only linearly with block length as opposed to the exponential increases arising from look-up table implementations of block codes.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/259664/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1993","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1993","volume":"39","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 1993","accessionNumber":"4627416","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","displayDocTitle":"Enumerable multitrack (d, k) block codes","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Enumerable multitrack (d, k) block codes","sourcePdf":"00259664.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.027463S","chronDate":"Sep 1993","isNumber":"6560","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"17","articleId":"259664","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":259665,"authors":[{"name":"K.B.

This approach is based on an evaluation analysis model and the evidence combination rule of the Dempster-Shafer theory. It is akin to a preference modeling approach, comprising an evidential reasoning framework for evaluation and quantification of qualitative attributes. Two operational algorithms have been developed within this approach for combining multiple uncertain subjective judgments. Based on this approach and a traditional MADM method, a decision making procedure is proposed to rank alternatives in MADM problems with uncertainty. A numerical example is discussed to demonstrate the implementation of the proposed approach.

To control the position of the arm, 200 neurons formed a network representing the three-dimensional workspace embedded in a four-dimensional system of coordinates from the two cameras, and learned a three-dimensional set of pressures corresponding to the end effector positions, as well as a set of 3/spl times/4 Jacobian matrices for interpolating between these positions. The gripper orientation was achieved through adaptation of a 1/spl times/4 Jacobian matrix for a fourth joint. Because of the properties of the rubber-tube actuators of the SoftArm, the position as a function of supplied pressure is nonlinear, nonseparable, and exhibits hysteresis. Nevertheless, through the neural network learning algorithm the position could be controlled to an accuracy of about one pixel (/spl sim/3 mm) after 200 learning steps and the orientation could be controlled to two pixels after 800 learning steps. This was achieved through employment of a linear correction algorithm using the Jacobian matrices mentioned above. Applications of repeated corrections in each positioning and grasping step leads to a very robust control algorithm since the Jacobians learned by the network have to satisfy the weak requirement that the Jacobian yields a reduction of the distance between gripper and target. The neural network employed in the control of the SoftArm bears close analogies to a network which successfully models visual brain maps. It is concluded, therefore, from this fact and from the close analogy between the SoftArm and natural muscle systems that the successful solution of the control problem has implications for biological visuo-motor control.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/259683/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1994","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4644898","volume":"24","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Neural network control of a pneumatic robot arm","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Neural network control of a pneumatic robot arm","sourcePdf":"00259683.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.070158S","chronDate":"Jan 1994","isNumber":"6561","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"21","citationCount":"105","articleId":"259683","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":259684,"authors":[{"name":"D.

Past research has focused on the improvement of operators and parameter settings and indicates that premature convergence is still the preeminent problem in GA's. This paper presents an improved genetic algorithm based on migration and artificial selection (GAMAS). GAMAS is an algorithm whose architecture is specifically designed to confront the causes of premature convergence. Though based on simple genetic algorithms, GAMAS is not concerned with the evolution of a single population, but instead is concerned with macroevolution, or the creation of multiple populations or species, and the derivation of solutions from the combined evolutionary effects of these species. New concepts that are emphasized in this architecture are artificial selection, migration, and recycling. Experimental results show that GAMAS consistently outperforms simple genetic algorithms and alleviates the problem of premature convergence.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/259687/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Jan. 1994","accessionNumber":"4644902","isJournal":true,"volume":"24","issue":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"The development and evaluation of an improved genetic algorithm based on migration and artificial selection","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The development and evaluation of an improved genetic algorithm based on migration and artificial selection","sourcePdf":"00259687.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.04528S","chronDate":"Jan 1994","isNumber":"6561","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"21","citationCount":"175","articleId":"259687","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":259688,"authors":[{"name":"Y.Y.

The technique has rarely been applied in practice owing to its poor dynamic performance. A novel feedforward control technique eliminates this decisive drawback: the space vector of the machine currents is forced to track a precalculated optimal trajectory in the steady-state and under the transient operating conditions commanded by the drive control system. Undesired transients caused by the pulse-width modulator are avoided. Experimental results obtained from a 30 kW AC drive are presented.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pdfPath":"/iel1/28/6562/00259719.pdf","startPage":"1098","endPage":"1105","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6562","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/28.259719","doi":"10.1109/28.259719","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=259719","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Space vector pulse width modulation","Pulse modulation","Pulse width modulation inverters","Optimal control","Pulse width modulation","Pulse inverters","Force control","Control systems","Switching frequency","Trajectory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electric current control","electric drives","invertors","pulse width modulation","transients"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optimal synchronous pulsewidth modulation","trajectory-tracking scheme","high-dynamic performance","PWM","high-power inverters","low switching frequency","feedforward control technique","space vector","steady-state","transient operating conditions","pulse-width modulator","AC drive","30 kW"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov/Dec 1993","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/259719/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov/Dec 1993","displayDocTitle":"Optimal synchronous pulsewidth modulation with a trajectory-tracking scheme for high-dynamic performance","accessionNumber":"4655226","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Nov.-Dec. 1993","volume":"29","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal synchronous pulsewidth modulation with a trajectory-tracking scheme for high-dynamic performance","sourcePdf":"00259719.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.025481S","chronDate":"Nov/Dec 1993","isNumber":"6562","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"28","citationCount":"28","articleId":"259719","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":259729,"authors":[{"name":"A.A.

Rural distribution feeders include single-phase, two-phase, and three-phase laterals off a main three-phase primary distribution feeder. The fault location scheme presented here attempts to account for the multiphase laterals, the unbalanced conditions, and the unsymmetrical nature of distribution feeders by continually updating voltage and current vectors at set locations within the system. The updated voltage and current vectors are the estimates of the 60-Hz phasor quantities obtained using a recursive optimal estimation algorithm. The distance to the fault is then estimated using a method based on the apparent impedance approach and the updated voltage and current vectors. Another consideration is the ability to determine the fault location on a lateral. A simulation of an actual rural distribution feeder using the Electromagnetic Transients Program (EMTP) is used to test the approach.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/259729/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov/Dec 1993","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov/Dec 1993","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Nov.-Dec. 1993","accessionNumber":"4655236","volume":"29","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A fault location technique for rural distribution feeders","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A fault location technique for rural distribution feeders","sourcePdf":"00259729.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.029407S","chronDate":"Nov/Dec 1993","isNumber":"6562","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"28","citationCount":"156","articleId":"259729","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":259734,"authors":[{"name":"B.M.

The physical models are 3-D extensions of 2-D string and segment based models. The models include secondary effects, such as material density variations and damage enhanced etching. A general facet motion algorithm supports simple, isotropic, cosine-directional, and general surface orientation dependent processes. A 3-D grid of rectangular prismatic cells, which is updated by the advancing surface, contains an alternate topography representation for fast shadow and visibility calculation. The program is organized as a collection of modular functions for continued model and algorithm development. Guidelines for estimating CPU and memory requirements for various models and simulation cases are based on an analysis of the algorithms and data structures. Simple processes, such as lithography development, require 1-5 min of CPU time. Simulations involving integration over flux distributions, such as plasma etching and sputter deposition, require from 5-30 min for typical cases.
