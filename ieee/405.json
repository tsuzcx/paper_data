But a new project, proposed by Irish renewable energy firm Airtricity, offers a possible solution. The company creates a source of limitless renewable energy, based in Europe, from which all countries can benefit. Airtricity aims to build a huge, pan-European electricity `supergrid' that will connect offshore windfarms from the Baltic sea to the Mediterranean, via the North Sea and the Atlantic. Supergrid is designed to carry energy from wind turbines to suppliers, and to act as a transmission network, enabling the secure spread of electricity between countries.

An interpolator should be used to obtain the channel information between adjacent pilots for a comb-type pattern. However, an interpolation method causes additional errors due to the interpolation properties of not detecting long delayed paths and generating fictitious paths, OFDM has its strength in realistic possibility of constructing the single frequency network (SFN). However, synchronization and channel estimation errors are revealed by multi-path fading with long delayed paths in SFN channels. We propose a robust channel estimator overcoming the adverse effects of long delayed signals in SFNs. A new channel estimator is proposed with the interpolated LS by applying phase shifted samples in the frequency-domain.

Then the constant-luminance system, in which the color subearrier information does not affect the brightness of the picture, may be described. Additional improvements consist of an improved subcarrier pattern to reduce crawling effects in the picture and sampling of the brightness signal at the transmitter to reduce \"shimmer\" resulting from cross talk of high vbideo-frequency components into the chromaticity channel.

Two types of surfaces were tested: the first is a flat grooved plate fed by a waveguide; the second, a circular, corrugated cylinder fed by a coaxial line. A modification of the second type results in a spirally grooved rod with similar properties. The measured field parameters are found to be predictable from existing theory. For properly designed structures the energy is essentially bound to the corrugated surface; little radiation occurs, and the attenuation of the traveling wave is due chiefly to losses in the metal. The effect of filling the corrugations with solid dielectric is also analyzed.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Study of Single-Surface Corrugated Guides","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IRE","doi":"10.1109/JRPROC.1951.273719","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IRE","pdfPath":"/iel5/10933/4050659/04050680.pdf","startPage":"952","endPage":"959","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JRPROC.1951.273719","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4050659","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4050680","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4050680/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug.  1951","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  1951","displayDocTitle":"A Study of Single-Surface Corrugated Guides","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"39","issue":"8","dateOfInsertion":"08 January 2007","publicationDate":"Aug. 1951","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Study of Single-Surface Corrugated Guides","sourcePdf":"JRPROC-v39-n8-21.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.066458S","chronDate":"Aug.  1951","isNumber":"4050659","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10933","citationCount":"76","articleId":"4050680","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1951","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4050706,"authors":[{"name":"S.

Transistor base thickness is shown to decrease as collector voltage is increased, resulting in an increase of the current-gain factor (\u03b1) and a decrease in the emitter potential required to maintain any fixed emitter current. These effects are shown to lead to two new elements in the theoretical small-signal equivalent circuit. One, the collector conductance (gc\u00b4), is proportional to emitter current and varies inversely with collector voltage.

The mobility and carrier concentration can be obtained from the Hall constant in conjunction with the resistivity; this cannot be done with the resistivity alone. The mobility is pertinent to the understanding of transistors since such things as high-frequency cut-off and the intrinsic current gain of the transistor are related to this property of germanium. The Hall effect and associated thermomagnetic and galvanomagnetic (Ettingshausen, Nernst, Righi-Leduc, and Ohmic) effects are discussed. The elimination of the effect of associated phenomena from the Hall measurement can be achieved in several ways.

It is concluded that the loss may approach zero db only in those cases where the image impedances seen at the ends of the system are purely resistive. Moreover, in such cases, the method of overcoming the transmission loss, whether by conventional repeaters or by series and shunt negative impedance loading, or otherwise, is quite immaterial to the external behavior of the system as long as the image impedances are not changed. The use of impedance-correcting networks provides one means of insuring that phase of the image impedance of the over-all system approaches zero. General relations are derived which connect the image impedance and the image gain of an active system with its over-all performance properties.","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1952","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4050938/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1952","volume":"40","issue":"3","publicationDate":"March 1952","dateOfInsertion":"08 January 2007","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Some Fundamental Properties of Transmission Systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Some Fundamental Properties of Transmission Systems","sourcePdf":"JRPROC-v40-n3-6.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.04345S","chronDate":"March  1952","isNumber":"4050932","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10933","citationCount":"149","articleId":"4050938","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1952","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4050939,"authors":[{"name":"G.

Such a system might be used to provide communication and automatic switching in rural telephony, or for other applications.","doi":"10.1109/JRPROC.1952.273878","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JRPROC.1952.273878","startPage":"1079","endPage":"1088","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IRE","pdfPath":"/iel5/10933/4051100/04051116.pdf","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IRE","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4051100","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Nonsynclronous Time Division with Holding and with Random Sampling","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  1952","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  1952","displayDocTitle":"Nonsynclronous Time Division with Holding and with Random Sampling","publicationDate":"Sept. 1952","dateOfInsertion":"08 January 2007","volume":"40","issue":"9","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4051116/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Nonsynclronous Time Division with Holding and with Random Sampling","sourcePdf":"JRPROC-v40-n9-16.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.029138S","chronDate":"Sept.  1952","isNumber":"4051100","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10933","citationCount":"11","articleId":"4051116","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1952","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":4051119,"authors":[{"name":"David A.

The transmission loss of a radio system is defined to be the ratio of the power radiated from the transmitting antenna to the resulting signal power available from a loss-free receiving antenna. After discussing some methods of measuring transmission loss, its calculation for representative systems is discussed. It is shown that a measure of transmission loss often adopted, namely the attenuation relative to the free-space value, sometimes leads to errors and confusion in the presentation of the results of measurements and in applications to radio systems; the use of the over-all transmission loss of a system avoids these pitfalls. A discussion is given of the expected variation with time (fading) of the transmission loss expected for radio systems involving ionospheric or tropospheric propagation. This discussion involves the theory of the Rayleigh distribution and its limitations in such applications. A definition is then derived for the effective noise figure of a radio system which includes the external noise picked up on the receiving antenna. This definition is used to explain the method of determining the maximum range of a radio system. Finally a discussion is given of the maximum range of a radio system as limited by interference from other radio signals plus noise rather than from noise alone.","doi":"10.1109/JRPROC.1953.274172","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JRPROC.1953.274172","startPage":"146","endPage":"152","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IRE","pdfPath":"/iel5/10933/4051130/04051172.pdf","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IRE","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4051130","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Transmission Loss in Radio Propagation","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  1953","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  1953","displayDocTitle":"Transmission Loss in Radio Propagation","publicationDate":"Jan. 1953","dateOfInsertion":"08 January 2007","volume":"41","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4051172/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Transmission Loss in Radio Propagation","sourcePdf":"JRPROC-v41-n1-42.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.03652S","chronDate":"Jan.  1953","isNumber":"4051130","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10933","citationCount":"35","articleId":"4051172","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1953","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4051186,"authors":[{"name":"Claude E.

We have concluded that useful predictions of wave propagation can be made with free space theoretical field strength reduced by theoretical knife edge diffraction shadow loss and by suitable empirical experience factors.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Experimental Study of Wave Propagation at 850 MC","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IRE","doi":"10.1109/JRPROC.1953.274401","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IRE","pdfPath":"/iel5/10933/4051349/04051356.pdf","startPage":"595","endPage":"611","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JRPROC.1953.274401","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4051349","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4051356","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4051356/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May  1953","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  1953","displayDocTitle":"An Experimental Study of Wave Propagation at 850 MC","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"41","issue":"5","dateOfInsertion":"08 January 2007","publicationDate":"May 1953","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Experimental Study of Wave Propagation at 850 MC","sourcePdf":"JRPROC-v41-n5-7.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.031239S","chronDate":"May  1953","isNumber":"4051349","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10933","citationCount":"107","articleId":"4051356","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1953","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4051359,"authors":[{"name":"A.

The idealization consists mainly of neglecting the action on the electron beam of radio-frequency fields due to the space charge in the beam. The limiting efficiency and the phase distortion are given for various values of the beam-to-circuit coupling parameter and of the electron injection velocity. The relative harmonic content of the beam is given to the fifth harmonic frequency, inclusive. The calculations were performed by numerically integrating the equations of motion of typical electrons entering the tube at equal intervals of initial phase. Most of the numerical work was done with IBM equipment, some with desk calculators, and in one case, on the Bell Laboratories relay computer. The results are presented almost entirely graphically, and the reader is referred to figures in main body of the paper for quantitative information.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Electron tubes","Phase distortion","Radiofrequency amplifiers","Electron beams","Optical coupling","Circuits","Current density","Radio frequency","Space charge","Calculators"]}],"doi":"10.1109/JRPROC.1953.274404","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IRE","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IRE","pdfPath":"/iel5/10933/4051349/04051359.pdf","startPage":"630","endPage":"637","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4051349","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JRPROC.1953.274404","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Theory of the Large Signal Behavior of Traveling-Wave Amplifiers","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4051359","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Theory of the Large Signal Behavior of Traveling-Wave Amplifiers","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4051359/","volume":"41","issue":"5","publicationDate":"May 1953","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"08 January 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  1953","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May  1953","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Theory of the Large Signal Behavior of Traveling-Wave Amplifiers","sourcePdf":"JRPROC-v41-n5-10.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.023556S","chronDate":"May  1953","isNumber":"4051349","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10933","citationCount":"75","articleId":"4051359","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1953","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4051364,"authors":[{"name":"R.

Restriction of the transmitted signal or receiver response to amplitude modulation alone or to phase modulation alone reduces the informational capacity of the system below the full channel capacity found by Shannon, C = W log (1+r2), with W the bandwidth in cps and r the rms signal-to-noise ratio. It is found that at very high signal-to-noise ratios the capabilities of AM alone and of PM alone each account for half this full informational capacity of the channel. When the signal-to-noise ratio is much less than unity, however, PM has 79% of the full channel capacity, while AM can transmit no more than about 17% of the full channel capacity. If a receiver is used which responds to both amplitude and phase, on the other hand, the capacity at low signal-to-noise ratios equals the full channel capacity whatever type of transmitter is used. An AM signal received on a PM receiver is found to be able at low signal-to-noise ratios to convey as much information as a PM signal.","doi":"10.1109/JRPROC.1953.274255","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IRE","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IRE","pdfPath":"/iel5/10933/4051373/04051383.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JRPROC.1953.274255","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4051373","startPage":"748","endPage":"759","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Comparison of the Informational Capacities of Amplitude- and Phase-Modulation Communication Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4051383","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A Comparison of the Informational Capacities of Amplitude- and Phase-Modulation Communication Systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  1953","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4051383/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"June  1953","isJournal":true,"volume":"41","issue":"6","publicationDate":"June 1953","dateOfInsertion":"08 January 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Comparison of the Informational Capacities of Amplitude- and Phase-Modulation Communication Systems","sourcePdf":"JRPROC-v41-n6-10.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.044711S","chronDate":"June  1953","isNumber":"4051373","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10933","citationCount":"23","articleId":"4051383","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1953","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4051384,"authors":[{"name":"Delmar V.

Phasing information inherent to the burst is considered first with particular regard to measures of accuracy, the required amount of integration, and the extent of the spectral region necessary to translate the burst information. Properties of elementary passive and active circuits for using the burst in receivers are described along with a determination of the limits of burst synchronization performance for these circuits. Fundamental considerations in the theory of synchronization show that better performance is obtainable with two-mode systems.

Their uses parallel those of ferromagnetic materials in such applications as high permeability materials, magnetostrictive transducers, magnetic amplifiers, and magnetic information storage devices. A review is given of the measured properties of single crystals to provide a background for the application of ceramics in capacitors and transducers, and their application in dielectric amplifiers. It is shown that the properties of ceramics can be stabilized by introducing amounts of lead and calcium titanate. A long-time aging effect can be reduced by a proper heat treatment. With these stabilized ceramics, applications such as electromechanical filters and delay lines can be satisfied. The theory of the dielectric amplifier is discussed and it is shown that stable amplifiers can be obtained by using the properties of single crystals. Amplifiers having carrier frequencies of 200 kc, signal frequencies of 0 to 7,000 cycles, and gains of 12 db, have been realized. These operate with single crystals below the Curie temperature and are stable over a wide temperatue range.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IRE","pdfPath":"/iel5/10933/4051572/04051575.pdf","startPage":"1606","endPage":"1620","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IRE","doi":"10.1109/JRPROC.1954.274655","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JRPROC.1954.274655","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4051572","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4051575","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Ferroelectrics and the Dielectric Amplifier","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Ferroelectric materials","Dielectrics","Magnetic materials","Magnetic devices","Magnetostriction","Magnetostrictive devices","Crystals","Ceramics","Transducers","Material storage"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4051575/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  1954","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov.  1954","displayDocTitle":"Ferroelectrics and the Dielectric Amplifier","volume":"42","issue":"11","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 1954","dateOfInsertion":"08 January 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Ferroelectrics and the Dielectric Amplifier","sourcePdf":"JRPROC-v42-n11-3.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.031216S","chronDate":"Nov.  1954","isNumber":"4051572","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10933","citationCount":"20","articleId":"4051575","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1954","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4051580,"authors":[{"name":"Marcel Muller","affiliation":["Varian Associates Inc.orporate, Palo Alto, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Marcel","lastName":"Muller","id":"37088052310"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0096-8390"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2162-6634"}],"articleNumber":"4051580","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":12,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":103},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Oscillators","Circuits","Electron tubes","Propagation constant","Electron beams","Equations","Tuning","Magnetic analysis","Operational amplifiers","Frequency"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4051580","doi":"10.1109/JRPROC.1954.274660","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JRPROC.1954.274660","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4051572","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IRE","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IRE","pdfPath":"/iel5/10933/4051572/04051580.pdf","startPage":"1651","endPage":"1658","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Traveling-Wave Amplifers and Backward-Wave Oscillators","abstract":"This paper presents the theory of the traveling-wave tube (TWT) and magnetron amplifier, and of the corresponding backward-wave oscillators, in a uinified form.

A generalized two-terminal-pair theory of junction transistors is presented which is applicable, on a dc basis, in all regions of operation. Using this theory, the open and closed impedances of the transistor switch are expressible in terms of easily measurable transistor parameters. For the ideal transistor these parameters are the saturation currents of the emitter and collector junctions and the normal and inverted alphas. The transition of the transistor switch from open to closed, or vice versa, is discussed, including the effects of minority carrier storage. This transition can be expressed in analytic form in terms of the alphas and the normal and inverted alpha cut-off frequencies.","doi":"10.1109/JRPROC.1954.274797","startPage":"1761","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IRE","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IRE","pdfPath":"/iel5/10933/4051591/04051599.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JRPROC.1954.274797","endPage":"1772","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4051591","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Large-Signal Behavior of Junction Transistors","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4051599/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1954","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1954","displayDocTitle":"Large-Signal Behavior of Junction Transistors","volume":"42","issue":"12","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"08 January 2007","publicationDate":"Dec. 1954","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Large-Signal Behavior of Junction Transistors","sourcePdf":"JRPROC-v42-n12-8.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.06062S","chronDate":"Dec.  1954","isNumber":"4051591","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10933","citationCount":"429","articleId":"4051599","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1954","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4051601,"authors":[{"name":"William R.

Passive RC filters, however, suffer from the defects of high in-band loss and poor economy of elements. These defects are overcome in active RC filters in which amplifying elements supply power to the filter in addition to that applied by the signal. A class of active filters is described in which one active component, a transistor negative-impedance converter, is employed. Simple unbalanced network configurations are obtained in which the number of capacitors in the RC circuits is equal to the total number of reactive elements in the corresponding LC filter. The ultimate limit in performance in this class of active filters is the drift in the converter. The drift in input impedance in converters employing Darlington's compound transistors is only a few tenths of a per cent of the load impedance for a wide range of loads. Such stability is more than adequate for many practical filter applications. The theory of this type of active RC filters is discussed and experimental tests are reported on low-pass, high-pass and band-pass filters.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IRE","pdfPath":"/iel5/10933/4051637/04051648.pdf","startPage":"555","endPage":"564","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IRE","doi":"10.1109/JRPROC.1954.274496","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JRPROC.1954.274496","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4051637","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4051648","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"RC Active Filters","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Active filters","Band pass filters","Impedance","Passive filters","Power supplies","Power filters","Capacitors","Circuits","Stability","Filtering theory"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4051648/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1954","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1954","displayDocTitle":"RC Active Filters","volume":"42","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 1954","dateOfInsertion":"08 January 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"RC Active Filters","sourcePdf":"JRPROC-v42-n3-11.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.054767S","chronDate":"March  1954","isNumber":"4051637","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10933","citationCount":"85","articleId":"4051648","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1954","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4051728,"authors":[{"name":"W.

By taking into account modification of the base region by the injected charge carriers, an explanation is found for the observed variation. Electric fields in the base region decrease the mean transit time for minority carriers on their way to the collector. This reduces the effect of surface recombination and increases current-amplification factor as the emitter current rises. Another effect, however, is in the opposite direction; this second effect is due to an increase in conductivity of the base material which increases the rate of volume recombination and also lowers emitter efficiency. The combination of these effects yields calculated curves which show a maximum and agree well with experiment. The work is applicable to both p-n-p and n-p-n types, and it is shown that the latter is inherently less sensitive to emitter current density.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IRE","pdfPath":"/iel5/10933/4051702/04051728.pdf","startPage":"914","endPage":"920","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IRE","doi":"10.1109/JRPROC.1954.274751","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JRPROC.1954.274751","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4051702","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4051728","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the Variation of Junction-Transistor Current-Amplification Factor with Emitter Current","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Conductivity","Current density","Senior members","Power transistors","Charge carriers","Conducting materials","Operational amplifiers","Impurities","Equations","Germanium"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4051728/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  1954","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"June  1954","displayDocTitle":"On the Variation of Junction-Transistor Current-Amplification Factor with Emitter Current","volume":"42","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"June 1954","dateOfInsertion":"08 January 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the Variation of Junction-Transistor Current-Amplification Factor with Emitter Current","sourcePdf":"JRPROC-v42-n6-26.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.044951S","chronDate":"June  1954","isNumber":"4051702","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10933","citationCount":"196","articleId":"4051728","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1954","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4051730,"authors":[{"name":"H.

Other practical design considerations are also discussed.","doi":"10.1109/JRPROC.1954.274820","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JRPROC.1954.274820","startPage":"1271","endPage":"1276","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IRE","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IRE","pdfPath":"/iel5/10933/4051774/04051788.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4051774","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High-Frequency Compensation of RC Amplifiers","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4051788/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  1954","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug.  1954","displayDocTitle":"High-Frequency Compensation of RC Amplifiers","volume":"42","issue":"8","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"08 January 2007","publicationDate":"Aug. 1954","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High-Frequency Compensation of RC Amplifiers","sourcePdf":"JRPROC-v42-n8-14.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.031192S","chronDate":"Aug.  1954","isNumber":"4051774","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10933","citationCount":"13","articleId":"4051788","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1954","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4051814,"authors":[{"name":"J.

Each mode of propagation consists of an infinite number of spatial Fourier components called spatial harmonics. The complicated behavior with frequency of the modes of a helix is explained as an effect of the coupling through spatial harmonics of the slow wave which travels with about the velocity of light along the wire to fast free-space or waveguide waves which travel with about the velocity of light along the axis. The qualitative effects of such coupling agree with a tape-helix analysis of helixes in free space and helixes surrounded by a conducting tube.

Any unwanted sideband occupies the same band as the desired sideband, and the unwanted sideband in the usual sense is not present.","doi":"10.1109/JRPROC.1956.275061","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IRE","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IRE","pdfPath":"/iel5/10933/4051933/04051946.pdf","startPage":"1703","endPage":"1705","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JRPROC.1956.275061","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4051933","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Third Method of Generation and Detection of Single-Sideband Signals","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4051946","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1956","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1956","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4051946/","displayDocTitle":"A Third Method of Generation and Detection of Single-Sideband Signals","volume":"44","issue":"12","publicationDate":"Dec. 1956","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"08 January 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Third Method of Generation and Detection of Single-Sideband Signals","sourcePdf":"JRPROC-v44-n12-13.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.017613S","chronDate":"Dec.  1956","isNumber":"4051933","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10933","citationCount":"166","articleId":"4051946","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1956","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4051949,"authors":[{"name":"Donald E.

The scattering matrix formulation is then introduced in terms of directional vectors and directional transformation matrices, and the transformation of the scattering matrix under a unitary change of polarization basis transformation is shown to be a congruent transformation. The congruent sub-group of unitary transformations of the polarization basis is then discussed, and it is shown that the scattering matrix can be reduced to diagonal form by this sub-group of transformations. A new matrix, called the polarization power scattering matrix, is then introduced and its relation to the scattering matrix is discussed. The power matrix gives the total power back-scattered from the target for any transmitted polarization. It specifies the scattering matrix up to two phase angles (one of which is of no importance), and is more easily measured.

The ideal reflection coefficient characteristic for the taper that gives the smallest pass band tolerance for a given cutoff frequency and vice versa is derived from the expression for the reflection coefficient of the optimum designed n section quarter-wave transformer by taking the limit as n tends to infinity. By neglecting the square of the reflection coefficient in the differential equation for the reflection coefficient on the taper, a synthesis procedure is derived for obtaining an optimum taper. The procedure is similar to that used in designing an optimum line source distribution in antenna theory. Conditions are derived for the maximum allowable pass band reflection and change in impedance level for which the theory remains accurate. For a maimum reflection coefficient of 0.1 in the pass band the theory remains accurate for all frequencies above the cutoff value provided the change in impedance level does not exceed 7.5. This optimum taper is compared with the well-known exponential and Gaussian tapers and is found to be 13.9 per cent and 27 per cent shorter respectively for the same cutoff frequency and pass band tolerance.","doi":"10.1109/JRPROC.1956.274938","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IRE","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IRE","pdfPath":"/iel5/10933/4052031/04052049.pdf","startPage":"539","endPage":"548","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4052031","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JRPROC.1956.274938","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The Optimum Tapered Transmission Line Matching Section","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4052049","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  1956","displayDocTitle":"The Optimum Tapered Transmission Line Matching Section","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4052049/","publicationDate":"April 1956","dateOfInsertion":"08 January 2007","isJournal":true,"volume":"44","issue":"4","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"April  1956","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Optimum Tapered Transmission Line Matching Section","sourcePdf":"JRPROC-v44-n4-18.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.026321S","chronDate":"April  1956","isNumber":"4052031","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10933","citationCount":"98","articleId":"4052049","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1956","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4052065,"authors":[{"name":"W.

These equations are a consequence only of the assumption of a single-valued characteristic for the nonlinear element. They are independent of the particular shape of this characteristic, of the power levels at the various frequencies, and of the external circuit in which the nonlinear reactor is connected. These general energy relations give information regarding the gain and stability of nonlinear reactor modulators and demodulators, and consequently of magnetic and dielectric amplifiers, without requirng detailed information about these devices. The utility of these equations is illustrated by discussing the gain and stability of the simplest types of nonlinear reactor modulators and demodulators and harmonic generators. This analysis for nonlinear inductors and capacitors is extended to include the effects of hysteresis in the nonlinear characteristic in the special case where the operating hysteresis loop is no more than double-valued. A similar analysis applied to nonlinear resistors yields two equations relating the reactive powers at the different frequencies, rather than the real powers as above. The interpretation of reactive power under these conditions is not clear.","doi":"10.1109/JRPROC.1956.275145","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IRE","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IRE","pdfPath":"/iel5/10933/4052114/04052124.pdf","startPage":"904","endPage":"913","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4052114","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JRPROC.1956.275145","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Some General Properties of Nonlinear Elements-Part I.

A similar analysis is made of the limits on angular accuracy imposed by a combination of receiver noise and one particular type of target cross section fluctuation. Operations which can be performed on the received signal to form an estimate of target angular position, the standard deviation of which approximately attains the theoretical lower bound, are discussed.

A target material may be considered as an anomaly in an image that has a spectral signature different from the spectral signatures of the background objects. In order to detect such anomalies in an image, the classes associated with the background have to be known. The method is based on the assumption that anomaly pixels are relatively rare in comparison with the abundance of the background class pixels. It consists of robust clustering of subsets of the image pixels. The resulting clusters may be considered as representatives of the background classes in the image. The clusters are obtained using a self-organising map (SOM) clustered using the local minima of the U-matrix (distance matrix). In a first stage the classes are built using a randomly chosen small percentage of the image pixels. Subsequently, the background classes are updated in a process where existing classes are reinforced or deleted from the feature space, new classes are formed and anomalies are detected.

In this article we address automated optimization of service coverage and radio base station antenna configuration. We consider three key configuration parameters: transmit power of the common pilot channel (CPICH), antenna tilt, and antenna azimuth. CPICH power greatly influences coverage. From a resource management point of view, satisfying the coverage requirement using minimum CPICH power offers several performance advantages. In particular, less CPICH power leads to less interference and higher system capacity. Optimal CPICH power, in its turn, is highly dependent on how the other two parameters, tilt and azimuth, are configured at radio base station antennas. Optimizing antenna tilt and azimuth network-wise, with the objective of minimizing the CPICH power consumption, is a challenging task. The solution approach in this article adopts automated optimization. Our optimization engine is a simulated annealing algorithm. Staring from an initial configuration, the algorithm searches effectively in the solution space of possible configurations in order to find improvements. The algorithm is computationally efficient; thus, we can optimize large networks without using excessive computing resources. We present a case study for a UMTS planning scenario in Lisbon. For this network, automated optimization saves up to 70 percent of the CPICH power used in the reference network configuration. In addition, the optimized network configuration offers significant performance improvement in terms of fewer overloaded cells and lower downlink load factor","doi":"10.1109/MWC.2006.275194","publicationTitle":"IEEE Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7742/4052289/04052296.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MWC.2006.275194","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4052289","startPage":"16","endPage":"25","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Automated optimization of service coverage and base station antenna configuration in UMTS networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4052296","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Automated optimization of service coverage and base station antenna configuration in UMTS networks","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4052296/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  2006","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"13","issue":"6","publicationDate":"Dec. 2006","accessionNumber":"9247191","dateOfInsertion":"08 January 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4052296/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Automated optimization of service coverage and base station antenna configuration in UMTS networks","sourcePdf":"SIOMINA.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.048042S","chronDate":"Dec.  2006","xplore-pub-id":"7742","isNumber":"4052289","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7742","citationCount":"99","xplore-issue":"4052289","articleId":"4052296","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-28"},{"_id":4052297,"authors":[{"name":"Katia Jaffres-Runser","affiliation":["Inria Ares-citi Laboratory, INSA Lyon, France"],"bio":{"p":["KATIA JAFFR\u00c8S-RUNSER [M] received her M.Sc.

This technology has been quickly adopted in private and public areas to provide convenient network access. The fast pace of development has often induced an uncoordinated deployment strategy where WLAN planning tools have barely been used. This article highlights the difficulty of planning such wireless networks in indoor environments. The first issue that must be faced in WLAN planning is accurate description of the quality of a network based on realistic propagation predictions. The second issue is to implement a search strategy that provides several alternative solutions. Thus, the radio engineer can choose the most promising one among them based on his/her experience and maybe some additional constraints. A description of already proposed planning strategies is given and opens out onto a new multiobjective planning formulation. This formulation evaluates coverage, interference level, and quality of service (in terms of data throughput per user) to measure the quality of a planning solution. A Tabu multiobjective algorithm is then implemented to search for the optimal set of non-dominated planning solutions, and a final selection process extracts the most significant solutions for the end user. This multiobjective QoS-oriented method is illustrated with a practical example that shows the performance of looking for several solutions, each expressing different trade-offs between the planning objectives","doi":"10.1109/MWC.2006.275195","publicationTitle":"IEEE Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7742/4052289/04052297.pdf","startPage":"26","endPage":"33","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MWC.2006.275195","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4052289","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"QoS constrained wireless LAN optimization within a multiobjective framework","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4052297","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  2006","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4052297/","displayDocTitle":"QoS constrained wireless LAN optimization within a multiobjective framework","volume":"13","issue":"6","publicationDate":"Dec. 2006","accessionNumber":"9247192","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4052297/","dateOfInsertion":"08 January 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"QoS constrained wireless LAN optimization within a multiobjective framework","sourcePdf":"JAFFRES.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.07548S","chronDate":"Dec.  2006","xplore-pub-id":"7742","isNumber":"4052289","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7742","citationCount":"31","xplore-issue":"4052289","articleId":"4052297","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4052300,"authors":[{"name":"Kaveh Pahlavan","affiliation":["WPI, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Kaveh Pahlavan kaveh@wpi.edu [f'96] is a professor of electrical and computer engineering and computer science, and director of the Center for Wireless Information Network Studies, Worcester Polytechnic Institute (CWINS/WPI), Massachusetts.

Bluetooth piconet is a prime example of an FH-based network with unlicensed operation. As a price for open access, the piconet may experience adverse interference from other collocated FH piconets or other wireless devices that are transmitting in the same unlicensed band. A basic approach to mitigate this interference is that the piconet applies adaptive FH (AFH) and attempts to hop over a set (hopset) of less interfered channels. On the other hand, the regulation of unlicensed operation sets constraints on possible hopset adaptations. In this article we present two novel AFH strategies: adaptive frequency rolling (AFR) and dynamic AFH (DAFH). AFR avoids self-interference while preserving the dynamics of spectrum usage as required by the current regulation. DAFH is a distributed mechanism by which collocated piconets select nonconflicting hopsets while trying to keep the hopset size as large as possible. DAFH is not completely compliant with current regulations, but the rationale given for its design contains new rules of behavior for the unlicensed spectrum. Both approaches significantly outperform the conventional AFH strategy","doi":"10.1109/MWC.2006.275200","startPage":"60","endPage":"67","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7742/4052289/04052302.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Wireless Communications","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MWC.2006.275200","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4052289","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Strategies for adaptive frequency hopping in the unlicensed bands","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Frequency","Personal area networks","Current control","Bluetooth","Master-slave","Interference","Communication standards","Error analysis","Throughput","Topology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Bluetooth","frequency allocation","frequency hop communication","radiofrequency interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive frequency hopping","unlicensed bands","short-range wireless networks","frequency planning","unlicensed spectrum","Bluetooth piconet","adverse interference","collocated FH piconets","interfered channels","adaptive frequency rolling","self-interference","distributed mechanism"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4052302/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  2006","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2006","displayDocTitle":"Strategies for adaptive frequency hopping in the unlicensed bands","volume":"13","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/4052302/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2006","dateOfInsertion":"08 January 2007","accessionNumber":"9247196","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Strategies for adaptive frequency hopping in the unlicensed bands","sourcePdf":"POPOVSKI.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.057209S","chronDate":"Dec.  2006","xplore-pub-id":"7742","isNumber":"4052289","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7742","citationCount":"48","xplore-issue":"4052289","articleId":"4052302","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4052339,"authors":[{"name":"Massimo Alioto","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Ingegneria dellInformazione (DII), Universit\u00e0 di Siena, Siena, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/92/4052337/4052339/4052339-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Massimo Alioto (M'01\u2013F'07) was born in Brescia, Italy, in 1972.

Analytical models of the delay sensitivity with respect to supply variations are derived by following a simplified circuit analysis, and the resulting expressions are simple enough to afford a deeper insight into the impact of supply voltage variations on each topology. The models are shown to be sufficiently accurate through simulations with CMOS technologies having a minimum feature size ranging from 90 nm to 0.35 mum. Several interesting properties and design considerations are derived from these models, and the effect of the supply voltage scaling, technology scaling, transistor sizing, and input transition time is discussed. Strategies to evaluate the delay sensitivity since the early design phases (e.g., from ring oscillator measurements) are also introduced. As a fundamental result, it is shown that the delay sensitivity to supply variations will increase in the next technology nodes, thus, it is expected that controlling the supply variations will be an increasingly important issue in the design of the next generation VLSI circuits.

The quest to achieve a good-drivability, noise-robustness, and low-energy operations for deep submicrometer guided our research to explore hybrid-CMOS style design. Hybrid-CMOS design style utilizes various CMOS logic style circuits to build new full adders with desired performance. This provides the designer a higher degree of design freedom to target a wide range of applications, thus significantly reducing design efforts. We also classify hybrid-CMOS full adders into three broad categories based upon their structure. Using this categorization, many full-adder designs can be conceived. We will present a new full-adder design belonging to one of the proposed categories. The new full adder is based on a novel xor-xnor circuit that generates xor and xnor full-swing outputs simultaneously. This circuit outperforms its counterparts showing 5%-37% improvement in the power-delay product (PDP). A novel hybrid-CMOS output stage that exploits the simultaneous xor-xnor signals is also proposed. This output stage provides good driving capability enabling cascading of adders without the need of buffer insertion between cascaded stages. There is approximately a 40% reduction in PDP when compared to its best counterpart. During our experimentations, we found out that many of the previously reported adders suffered from the problems of low swing and high noise when operated at low supply voltages. The proposed full adder is energy efficient and outperforms several standard full adders without trading off driving capability and reliability. The new full-adder circuit successfully operates at low voltages with excellent signal integrity and driving capability. To evaluate the performance of the new full adder in a real circuit, we embedded it in a 4- and 8-b, 4-operand carry-save array adder with final carry-propagate adder.

The results indicate that both CDMFFs have the best power-delay product in their groups, respectively. In the aspect of power dissipation, the single-ended and differential CDMFFs consume the least power at data activity less than 50%, and are 31% and 26% less power than the conditional capture flip-flops at 25% data activity, respectively. In the aspect of performance, CDMFFs achieve small data-to-output delays, comparable to those of the transmission-gate pulsed latch and the modified-sense-amplifier flip-flop. In the aspect of timing reliability, CDMFFs have the best internal race immunity among pulse-triggered flip-flops. A post-layout case study is demonstrated with comparison to a transmission-gate flip-flop.

The presented error-correcting latch and flip-flop designs are power efficient, introduce minimal speed penalty, and employ reuse of on-chip scan design-for-testability and design-for-debug resources to minimize area overheads. Circuit simulations using a sub-90-nm technology show that the presented designs achieve more than a 20-fold reduction in cell-level soft error rate (SER). Fault injection experiments conducted on a microprocessor model further demonstrate that chip-level SER improvement is tunable by selective placement of the presented error-correcting designs. When coupled with error correction code to protect in-pipeline memories, the BISER flip-flop design improves chip-level SER by 10 times over an unprotected pipeline with the flip-flops contributing an extra 7-10.5% in power. When only soft errors in flips-flops are considered, the BISER technique improves chip-level SER by 10 times with an increased power of 10.3%.

The proposed converter is based on a modified version of the isolated half-bridge converter topology that utilizes three basic modes of operation within a constant-frequency switching cycle to provide two independent control variables. This allows tight control over two of the converter ports, while the third port provides the power balance in the system. The switching sequence ensures a clamping path for the energy of the leakage inductance of the transformer at all times. This energy is further utilized to achieve zero-voltage switching for all primary switches for a wide range of source and load conditions. Basic steady-state analysis of the proposed converter is included, together with a suggested structure for feedback control.

Possible parallel operation situations of two APFs are investigated, and then the proposed topology is analyzed. The filters are coupled in a combined topology in which one filter is connected in a feedback loop and the other is in a feedforward loop for harmonic compensation. Thus, both active power filters bring their own characteristic advantages, i.e., the feedback filter improves the steady-state performance of the harmonic mitigation and the feedforward filter improves the dynamic response. Another characteristic of the proposed topology is the possibility of joint operation of both filters either as frequency-sharing or load-sharing, with or without redundancy. The frequency-sharing operation is possible due to the control algorithm, which is based on selective harmonic compensation using equivalent harmonic integrators. Implementation details and a discussion on the efficiency improvement for various switching frequencies are provided. The evaluation of the proposed topology concludes that this approach is very practical for achieving both low and high order harmonic compensation and stable grid operation. This is supported by extensive measurement results on a 15-kVA laboratory setup, indicating a reduction in total harmonic current distortion from the existing 30% to less than 2% for a typical adjustable speed drive application","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 January 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4052396/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2007","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"22","issue":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"08 January 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4052396/","accessionNumber":"9259578","displayDocTitle":"Performance Improvement of Shunt Active Power Filter With Dual Parallel Topology","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance Improvement of Shunt Active Power Filter With Dual Parallel Topology","sourcePdf":"22tpel01-asiminoaei.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.067122S","chronDate":"Jan.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"4052394","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"71","xplore-issue":"4052394","articleId":"4052396","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4052397,"authors":[{"name":"Vladimir Blasko","affiliation":["Otis Elevator Company Engineering Center, Farmington, CT, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/4052394/4052397/4052397-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Vladimir Blasko (M'89\u2013SM'97) received the B.Sc., M.S., and Ph.D. degrees from the University of Zagreb, Croatia, in 1976, 1982, and 1986, respectively, all in electrical engineering.","From 1976 to 1988, he was with the Electrotech-nical Institute of Koncar Company, Zagreb, in the Power Electronics and Automatic Control Department.

In those applications, \"filtering\" is a primary objective. However, in power electronic applications control, with objectives like fast response of system on reference and disturbance change, is of primary importance. This paper provides a novel and a systematic design approach for applying signal processing methods (like modified adaptive selective harmonic elimination algorithms) as an addition to conventional control. Thus, both control objectives like fast transient response and efficient harmonic (disturbance) filtering are achieved. The filtering algorithm does not interfere and has minimal impact on the stability of the primary control loop. Its sole function is to eliminate undesirable higher harmonic components from selected variable (current or voltage) and it requires only knowledge of the frequency of the component to be eliminated. The methodology is applicable for a wide range of equipment like uninterrupted power systems, regenerative converters, active power filters, etc. The application of the proposed method in a regenerative voltage source converter for dead time compensation is used as an example for illustrating its effectiveness and design procedure","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4052397","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power system harmonics","Power electronics","Power harmonic filters","Signal processing algorithms","Active filters","Filtering","Control systems","Electric variables control","Power system stability","Voltage"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["filtering theory","power convertors","power harmonic filters","transient response","uninterruptible power supplies"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power electronic equipment","digital signal processing","power electronic application control","systematic design approach","adaptive selective harmonic elimination algorithms","transient response","filtering algorithm","primary control loop","uninterrupted power systems","regenerative converters","active power filters","regenerative voltage source converter","dead time compensation"]}],"publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/63/4052394/04052397.pdf","startPage":"223","endPage":"228","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4052394","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2006.886599","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2006.886599","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Novel Method for Selective Harmonic Elimination in Power Electronic Equipment","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 January 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4052397/","displayDocTitle":"A Novel Method for Selective Harmonic Elimination in Power Electronic Equipment","isDynamicHtml":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"08 January 2007","publicationDate":"Jan. 2007","accessionNumber":"9259575","htmlLink":"/document/4052397/","volume":"22","issue":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Novel Method for Selective Harmonic Elimination in Power Electronic Equipment","sourcePdf":"22tpel01-blasko.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.058004S","chronDate":"Jan.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"4052394","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"94","xplore-issue":"4052394","articleId":"4052397","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4052398,"authors":[{"name":"John T.

In the ANW control system, a neural controller is the main controller used to mimic an ideal controller and a compensated controller is designed to recover the residual of the approximation error. In this study, an online adaptive law with a variable optimal learning-rate is derived based on the Lyapunov stability theorem, so that not only the stability of the system can be guaranteed but also the convergence of controller parameters can be speeded up.

The controller is mainly tailored to compensate harmonic currents of nonlinear loads connected to the mains. However, it can also achieve reactive-power compensation and mains-current balancing when required. The controller has a two-layer structure. The outer layer generates the current references for the inner layer. The former uses a plug-in discrete-time repetitive algorithm for current-harmonic compensation, a proportional-integral algorithm to maintain the dc-capacitor voltage in spite of unmodeled losses and a reactive-power-reference generator. The inner layer uses state-feedback with integral action for current control. The repetitive controller is justified to improve the tracking of the periodic current references required by the active filters.

The IMC is modulated using indirect space-vector modulation. The effect of symmetric supply harmonics on load voltages and currents is analyzed using space-vector presentation. The measurement and simulation results with distorted supply voltages are compared to the results with pure sinusoidal supply voltage. Four simple control methods of IMC are tested in simulations and measurements: 1) open-loop control without measurements (Method I); 2) calculation of modulation index using measured supply voltages (Method II); 3) closed-loop control of output currents (Method III); and 4) combination of Methods II and III, i.e., closed-loop output current control with supply voltage measurement (Method IV). All the methods are easy to implement and do not require complicated computing.

These inverters, however, support only current-buck dc-ac power conversion and need a relatively complex modulator, as compared to conventional voltage source (VS) inverters. To address these limitations, this paper presents an integration of the buck-boost Z-source power conversion concept to the CS inverter topology to develop single- and three-phase Z-source CS inverters. For their efficient control, the paper starts by evaluating different carrier-based reference formulations to identify different inverter state placement possibilities. The paper then proceeds to design appropriate \"reference-to-switch\" assignments or logic equations for mapping out the correct CS gating signals, allowing a simple carrier-based modulator to control a Z-source CS inverter with complications such as commutation difficulties and \"many-to-many\" state assignments readily resolved. The developed system can be implemented using a digital signal processor with an embedded VS pulse-width modulator and an external programmable logic device, hence offering a competitive solution for medium power single and three-phase buck-boost power conversion.

Low frequency nonsinusoidal waveforms are also common in ac motor applications with waveforms such as pulsewidth modulation and six-step. Previous attempts to model these losses, based on the Steinmetz equation, can work only in a limited range of frequencies, flux density excitations, and waveforms. In this paper, we present a very practical, yet very general and accurate model, for core loss calculations in case of nonsinusoidal voltage waveforms. We show the model is equally applicable to low and high frequencies, metallic as well as nonmetallic (e.g., ferrites) core materials, by comparing the model prediction with measured data for various waveforms, frequencies, and flux densities. The model can be used for the design of high frequency transformers and inductors for use in switched mode power supplies.

Combining results from different types of imagery gives significantly higher recognition rates than are obtained by using a single intensity image. However, significantly higher recognition rates are also obtained by combining results from multiple intensity images.

However, the performance of 2-D FR systems can be degraded by natural factors such as expressions, illuminations, pose, and aging. Several FR algorithms have been proposed to deal with the resulting appearance variability. However, most of these methods employ features derived in the image or the space domain whereas there are benefits to working in the spatial frequency domain (i.e., the 2-D Fourier transforms of the images). These benefits include shift-invariance, graceful degradation, and closed-form solutions. We discuss the use of spatial frequency domain methods (also known as correlation filters or correlation pattern recognition) for FR and illustrate the advantages. However, correlation filters can be computationally demanding due to the need for computing 2-D Fourier transforms and may not match well for large-scale FR problems such as in the Face Recognition Grand Challenge (FRGC) phase-II experiments that require the computation of millions of similarity metrics. We will discuss a new method [called the class-dependence feature analysis (CFA)] that reduces the computational complexity of correlation pattern recognition and show the results of applying CFA to the FRGC phase-II data","doi":"10.1109/JPROC.2006.884094","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel5/5/4052463/04052477.pdf","startPage":"1963","endPage":"1976","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JPROC.2006.884094","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4052463","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Correlation Pattern Recognition for Face Recognition","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4052477","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov.  2006","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4052477/","displayDocTitle":"Correlation Pattern Recognition for Face Recognition","volume":"94","issue":"11","publicationDate":"Nov. 2006","accessionNumber":"9271392","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4052477/","dateOfInsertion":"08 January 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Correlation Pattern Recognition for Face Recognition","sourcePdf":"94jproc11-kumar.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.091109S","chronDate":"Nov.  2006","xplore-pub-id":"5","isNumber":"4052463","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"109","xplore-issue":"4052463","articleId":"4052477","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":4052478,"authors":[{"name":"James R.

Commercial systems based on the algorithms developed by John Daugman have been available since 1995 and have been used in a variety of practical applications. However, all currently available systems impose substantial constraints on subject position and motion during the recognition process. These constraints are largely driven by the image acquisition process, rather than the particular pattern-matching algorithm used for the recognition process. In this paper we present results of our efforts to substantially reduce constraints on position and motion by means of a new image acquisition system based on high-resolution cameras, video synchronized strobed illumination, and specularity based image segmentation. We discuss the design tradeoffs we made in developing the system and the performance we have been able to achieve when the image acquisition system is combined with a standard iris recognition algorithm. The Iris on the Move (IOM) system is the first system to enable capture of iris images of sufficient quality for iris recognition while the subject is moving at a normal walking pace through a minimally confining portal","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Iris on the Move: Acquisition of Images for Iris Recognition in Less Constrained Environments","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","doi":"10.1109/JPROC.2006.884091","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel5/5/4052463/04052478.pdf","startPage":"1936","endPage":"1947","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JPROC.2006.884091","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4052463","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4052478","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4052478/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov.  2006","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2006","displayDocTitle":"Iris on the Move: Acquisition of Images for Iris Recognition in Less Constrained Environments","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"94","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/4052478/","dateOfInsertion":"08 January 2007","publicationDate":"Nov. 2006","accessionNumber":"9271390","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Iris on the Move: Acquisition of Images for Iris Recognition in Less Constrained Environments","sourcePdf":"94jproc11-matey.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.06174S","chronDate":"Nov.  2006","xplore-pub-id":"5","isNumber":"4052463","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"222","xplore-issue":"4052463","articleId":"4052478","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4052479,"authors":[{"name":"Mark S.

We shall describe results on the most popular database, showing how recognition can handle some of the covariates that can affect recognition.

The challenge is to generalize from a limited number of images of an individual to a broad range of conditions. Recently, advances in modeling the effects of illumination and pose have been accomplished using three-dimensional (3-D) shape information coupled with reflectance models. Notable developments in understanding the effects of illumination include the nonexistence of illumination invariants, a characterization of the set of images of objects in fixed pose under variable illumination (the illumination cone), and the introduction of spherical harmonics and low-dimensional linear subspaces for modeling illumination. To generalize to novel conditions, either multiple images must be available to reconstruct 3-D shape or, if only a single image is accessible, prior information about the 3-D shape and appearance of faces in general must be used. The 3-D Morphable Model was introduced as a generative model to predict the appearances of an individual while using a statistical prior on shape and texture allowing its parameters to be estimated from single image. Based on these new understandings, face recognition algorithms have been developed to address the joint challenges of pose and lighting. In this paper, we review these developments and provide a brief survey of the resulting face recognition algorithms and their performance","doi":"10.1109/JPROC.2006.886019","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel5/5/4052463/04052480.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JPROC.2006.886019","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4052463","startPage":"1977","endPage":"1999","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Face Recognition Using 3-D Models: Pose and Illumination","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4052480","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Face Recognition Using 3-D Models: Pose and Illumination","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4052480/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov.  2006","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"94","issue":"11","publicationDate":"Nov. 2006","accessionNumber":"9271393","dateOfInsertion":"08 January 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4052480/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Face Recognition Using 3-D Models: Pose and Illumination","sourcePdf":"94jproc11-romdhani.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.138019S","chronDate":"Nov.  2006","xplore-pub-id":"5","isNumber":"4052463","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"52","xplore-issue":"4052463","articleId":"4052480","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":4052483,"authors":[{"name":"Pawan Sinha","affiliation":["Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5/4052463/4052483/4052483-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Pawan Sinha received the B.S. degree in computer science from the Indian Institute of Technology, New Delhi, and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees from the Department of Computer Science, Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), Cambridge.","He is an Associate Professor of neuroscience in the Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences, MIT.

Transcoding is an important technology which adapts the same multimedia object to diverse mobile appliances; thus, users' requests for a specified version of a multimedia object could be served by a more detailed version cached according to transcoding. Therefore, it is particularly of theoretical and practical necessity to determine the proper version to be cached at each node such that the specified objective is achieved. In this paper, we address the problem of multimedia object placement for transparent data replication. The performance objective is to minimize the total access cost by considering both transmission cost and transcoding cost. We present optimal solutions for different cases for this problem. The performance of the proposed solutions is evaluated with a set of carefully designed simulation experiments for various performance metrics over a wide range of system parameters. The simulation results show that our solution consistently and significantly outperforms comparison solutions in terms of all the performance metrics considered","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4052573/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 January 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2007","publicationDate":"Feb. 2007","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4052573/","dateOfInsertion":"08 January 2007","accessionNumber":"9294630","volume":"18","issue":"2","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Multimedia Object Placement for Transparent Data Replication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multimedia Object Placement for Transparent Data Replication","sourcePdf":"l0212.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.122299S","chronDate":"Feb.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"71","isNumber":"4052565","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"71","citationCount":"30","xplore-issue":"4052565","articleId":"4052573","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4052585,"authors":[{"name":"Jo E.

However, in many disciplines, the nature, role and even the necessity of theories remain matters for debate, particularly in young or practical disciplines such as software engineering. This article reports a systematic review of the explicit use of theory in a comprehensive set of 103 articles reporting experiments, from of a total of 5,453 articles published in major software engineering journals and conferences in the decade 1993-2002. Of the 103 articles, 24 use a total of 40 theories in various ways to explain the cause-effect relationship(s) under investigation. The majority of these use theory in the experimental design to justify research questions and hypotheses, some use theory to provide post hoc explanations of their results, and a few test or modify theory. A third of the theories are proposed by authors of the reviewed articles. The interdisciplinary nature of the theories used is greater than that of research in software engineering in general. We found that theory use and awareness of theoretical issues are present, but that theory-driven research is, as yet, not a major issue in empirical software engineering. Several articles comment explicitly on the lack of relevant theory. We call for an increased awareness of the potential benefits of involving theory, when feasible. To support software engineering researchers who wish to use theory, we show which of the reviewed articles on which topics use which theories for what purposes, as well as details of the theories' characteristics","doi":"10.1109/TSE.2007.12","startPage":"87","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/32/4052581/04052585.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSE.2007.12","endPage":"107","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4052581","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Systematic Review of Theory Use in Software Engineering Experiments","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4052585/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 January 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2007","displayDocTitle":"A Systematic Review of Theory Use in Software Engineering Experiments","volume":"33","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/4052585/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"9292437","dateOfInsertion":"08 January 2007","publicationDate":"Feb. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Systematic Review of Theory Use in Software Engineering Experiments","sourcePdf":"e0087.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.207605S","chronDate":"Feb.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"32","isNumber":"4052581","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"32","citationCount":"119","xplore-issue":"4052581","articleId":"4052585","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4052593,"authors":[{"name":"J.

Analyzing the theoretical limits inherently present when loading such common radiators with metamaterials, we show how these configurations may exhibit in principle an arbitrarily low resonant frequency for a fixed dimension, but they may not necessarily radiate efficiently when their size is electrically small. However, interesting possibilities are suggested to overcome these limitations by employing circular or more complex patch geometries in order to select specific modes that, when appropriate loading ratios between the filling materials are chosen, also ensure radiation performance comparable qualitatively with a regular patch radiator of standard dimensions. Realistic numerical simulations, considering material dispersion, losses and the presence of the antenna feed are presented, showing how a practical realization is foreseeable.

The equivalence principle allows the replacement of unknown currents distributed in a volume in space by equivalence currents residing on the surface that bounds the volume. It also allows the dissociation of the solution of one region from that of another region. In this manner, problems of high complexity can be encapsulated by surfaces of simpler shapes using less unknowns. It can aid in parallel algorithms, reusability of solutions, as well as improving the condition number of a matrix system when disparate mesh or adaptive mesh are needed. The challenge arises when an equivalence surface intercepts a current-carrying conductor, because the breakup of the current into separate pieces gives rise to charge singularity. A junction basis can be used to mitigate this singularity. However, a better solution is to introduce a tap basis to model the current that intercepts with the equivalence surfaces. Using this scheme, the current continuity is conserved and the singularity of the charges is avoided. The solution is shown to be accurate","doi":"10.1109/TAP.2006.888453","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.2006.888453","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4052595","startPage":"130","endPage":"138","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel5/8/4052595/04052617.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4052617","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Distributed decision making","Electromagnetic scattering","Integral equations","Power engineering computing","Moment methods","Computational electromagnetics","Finite difference methods","Shape","Parallel algorithms","Conductors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational electromagnetics","electric current","integral equations","matrix decomposition","method of moments"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wave-field interaction","equivalence principle algorithm","domain decomposition scheme","integral equation solvers","method of moments","matrix system","current-carrying conductor"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Domain decomposition","equivalence principle","integral equation","integral equation solvers","junction basis","method of moments (MoM)","tap basis"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Wave-Field Interaction With Complex Structures Using Equivalence Principle Algorithm","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2007","isJournal":true,"volume":"55","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2007","accessionNumber":"9257613","dateOfInsertion":"08 January 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4052617/","isStaticHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 January 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4052617/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Wave-Field Interaction With Complex Structures Using Equivalence Principle Algorithm","sourcePdf":"55tap01-li.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.054477S","chronDate":"Jan.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"4052595","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"137","xplore-issue":"4052595","articleId":"4052617","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-15"},{"_id":4052618,"authors":[{"name":"Nuria Llombart","affiliation":["TNO Defence, Security and Safety, Den Haag, Netherlands"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8/4052595/4052618/4052618-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Nuria Llombart (S'06\u2013M'07) received the Ingeniero de Telecomunicaci\u00f3n degree and the Ph.D. degree from the Universidad Polit\u00e9cnica de Valencia, Spain, in 2002 and 2006, respectively.","She spent one year 2000 to 2001, at the Friedrich-Alexander University of Erlangen-Nuremberg, Germany, and worked at the Fraunhofer Institute for Integrated Circuits in Erlangen, Germany, from 2000 until 2002.

It is very suitable for applications in military platforms where FSS is used for antennas and radars' radar cross section (RCS) reduction. The filtenna is simulated and optimized with CST software and its performance is verified by experiments. From simulated and measured results it can be found that the proposed structure keeps characteristics of return loss, radiation pattern and gain of the horn antenna within desired frequency band, meanwhile presents effective reflection to interference signals at out-band.

The embedded-circuit building blocks are very small in size (<lambda/20) and constitute artificial material molecules. Geometric control of the embedded-circuits allows epsiv and mu to be tailored to the application. A transmission line circuit model analogy is developed to theoretically investigate the behavior of designed embedded-circuit metamaterial and predict its physical parameters.

This paper presents the favored results of fuzzy neural network (FNN) control for a pneumatic system based on extended Kalman filer (EKF). To optimally design a FNN controller for the pneumatic system, back- propagation (BP) algorithm is used to update the parameters of membership functions on-line. The partial derivative of the plant output with respect to the input, which is required by the learning process of FNN, is approximately estimated with a feed-forward neural network trained by recursive EKF. With the designed FNN controller for the pneumatic system, precise steady-state response and good dynamic tracking are obtained, which demonstrate that the nonlinear dynamics of the pneumatic system are efficiently overcome.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov. 28 2006-Dec. 1 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4052717/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10221521","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4052717/","publicationDate":"Nov. 2006","dateOfInsertion":"08 January 2007","conferenceDate":"28 Nov.-1 Dec. 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Improved Fuzzy Neural Network Control for a Pneumatic System Based on Extended Kalman Filter","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improved Fuzzy Neural Network Control for a Pneumatic System Based on Extended Kalman Filter","confLoc":"Sydney, NSW, Australia","sourcePdf":"27310076.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052727S","chronDate":"Nov. 28 2006-Dec. 1 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4052642","isNumber":"4052643","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4052642","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4052643","articleId":"4052717","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":4052725,"authors":[{"name":"Amir Mohammadi","affiliation":["Science and Research Branch, Islamic Azad University, Iran"],"firstName":"Amir","lastName":"Mohammadi","id":"37285483900"},{"name":"Mohammad Hadi Varahram","affiliation":["Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Mohammad Hadi","lastName":"Varahram","id":"37297200800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7695-2731-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4052725","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":134},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4052725","abstract":"In this study, two methods for solving economic dispatch problems, namely Hopfield neural network and lambda iteration method are compared.

Moreover, in many situations NNs more or less suffer from the slow convergence and occasionally involve in a local optimal solution, which strongly limited their applications in practice. To overcome NN's drawbacks, this paper presents a hybrid system that merges the three evolution techniques, i.e. neural networks, fuzzy logic and genetic algorithms, into a comprehensive model, named as a modified genetic fuzzy neural network (GFNN).

This paper has developed an effective approach to the precise control on a pneumatic system through the combination of an artificial neural network and generalized predictive control (GPC) algorithm. An ARMAX model of the pneumatic system is derived from the weights of a multilayer feed-forward neural network trained with Levenberg-Marquardt method. Nelder-Mead downhill simplex method was applied in this paper to optimize the built ARMAX model, and the better results were obtained through the generalized predictive control for this pneumatic system. The performance of the designed GPC controller is very impressive for the fast response and high accuracy tracking.","doi":"10.1109/CIMCA.2006.111","publicationTitle":"2006 International Conference on Computational Inteligence for Modelling Control and Automation and International Conference on Intelligent Agents Web Technologies and International Commerce (CIMCA'06)","startPage":"223","endPage":"223","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CIMCA.2006.111","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4052643","pdfPath":"/iel5/4052642/4052643/04052837.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 International Conference on Computational Inteligence for Modelling Control and Automation and International Conference on Intelligent Agents Web Technologies and International Commerce (CIMCA'06)","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Predictive control","Pneumatic systems","Predictive models","Artificial neural networks","Automatic control","Control systems","Robotics and automation","Manufacturing automation","Nonlinear control systems","Multi-layer neural network"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["learning (artificial intelligence)","multilayer perceptrons","pneumatic systems","predictive control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["generalized predictive control","pneumatic system","optimized ARMAX model","artificial neural network","precise control","multilayer feed-forward neural network training","Levenberg-Marquardt method","Nelder-Mead downhill simplex method"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Generalized Predictive Control for a Pneumatic System Based on an Optimized ARMAX Model with an Artificial Neural Network","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4052837/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4052837/","accessionNumber":"10208185","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"08 January 2007","publicationDate":"Nov. 2006","conferenceDate":"28 Nov.-1 Dec. 2006","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov. 28 2006-Dec. 1 2006","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Generalized Predictive Control for a Pneumatic System Based on an Optimized ARMAX Model with an Artificial Neural Network","confLoc":"Sydney, NSW, Australia","sourcePdf":"27310223.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045512S","chronDate":"Nov. 28 2006-Dec. 1 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4052642","isNumber":"4052643","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4052642","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4052643","articleId":"4052837","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":4052983,"authors":[{"name":"Ioannis V.

However, there are still deficiencies that hinder their performance. One deficiency is the use of rules in the classification stage. Current systems assign classes to new objects based on the best rule applied or on some predefined scoring of multiple rules. In this paper we propose a new technique where the system automatically learns how to use the rules. We achieve this by developing a two-stage classification model. First, we use association rule mining to discover classification rules. Second, we employ another learning algorithm to learn how to use these rules in the prediction process. Our two-stage approach outperforms C4.5 and RIPPER on the UCI datasets in our study, and outperforms other rule- learning methods on more than half the datasets. The versatility of our method is also demonstrated by applying it to text classification, where it equals the performance of the best known systems for this task, SVMs.","doi":"10.1109/ICDM.2006.97","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICDM.2006.97","startPage":"33","endPage":"42","displayPublicationTitle":"Sixth International Conference on Data Mining (ICDM'06)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4053012/4053013/04053032.pdf","publicationTitle":"Sixth International Conference on Data Mining (ICDM'06)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4053013","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Learning to Use a Learned Model: A Two-Stage Approach to Classification","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"18-22 Dec. 2006","displayDocTitle":"Learning to Use a Learned Model: A Two-Stage Approach to Classification","conferenceDate":"18-22 Dec. 2006","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2006","dateOfInsertion":"08 January 2007","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4053032/","accessionNumber":"10222242","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4053032/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Learning to Use a Learned Model: A Two-Stage Approach to Classification","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"270100033.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.091425S","chronDate":"18-22 Dec. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4053012","isNumber":"4053013","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4053012","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"4053013","articleId":"4053032","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4053037,"authors":[{"name":"Mikhail Bilenko","affiliation":["Microsoft Research Limited, Redmond, WA, USA"],"firstName":"Mikhail","lastName":"Bilenko","id":"37550539400"},{"name":"Beena Kamath","affiliation":["Google, Inc., Mountain View, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Beena","lastName":"Kamath","id":"37824386700"},{"name":"Raymond J.

Pairwise similarity computations are particularly important in record linkage systems, as well as in clustering and schema mapping algorithms. Because the number of object pairs grows quadratically with the size of the dataset, computing similarity between all pairs is impractical and becomes prohibitive for large datasets and complex similarity functions. Blocking methods alleviate this problem by efficiently selecting approximately similar object pairs for subsequent distance computations, leaving out the remaining pairs as dissimilar. Previously proposed blocking methods require manually constructing an index- based similarity function or selecting a set of predicates, followed by hand-tuning of parameters. In this paper, we introduce an adaptive framework for automatically learning blocking functions that are efficient and accurate. We describe two predicate-based formulations of learnable blocking functions and provide learning algorithms for training them. The effectiveness of the proposed techniques is demonstrated on real and simulated datasets, on which they prove to be more accurate than non-adaptive blocking methods.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4053037/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-22 Dec. 2006","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"18-22 Dec. 2006","htmlLink":"/document/4053037/","dateOfInsertion":"08 January 2007","publicationDate":"Dec. 2006","accessionNumber":"10222246","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive Blocking: Learning to Scale Up Record Linkage","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive Blocking: Learning to Scale Up Record Linkage","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"270100087.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.07199S","chronDate":"18-22 Dec. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4053012","isNumber":"4053013","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4053012","citationCount":"88","xplore-issue":"4053013","articleId":"4053037","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":4053043,"authors":[{"name":"Matt Culver","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Nebraska, Lincolnshire, NE, USA"],"firstName":"Matt","lastName":"Culver","id":"37826418400"},{"name":"Deng Kun","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Nebraska, Lincolnshire, NE, USA"],"firstName":"Deng","lastName":"Kun","id":"37549920200"},{"name":"Stephen Scott","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Nebraska, Lincolnshire, NE, USA"],"firstName":"Stephen","lastName":"Scott","id":"37284282700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-2701-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-4786"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2374-8486"}],"articleNumber":"4053043","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":16,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":166},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sampling methods","Machine learning","Algorithm design and analysis","Labeling","Support vector machines","Support vector machine classification","Computer science","Machine learning algorithms","Web pages","Robustness"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["learning (artificial intelligence)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["machine learning algorithm","performance criterion","active learning algorithms","closest sampling from","receiver operating curve analysis"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4053043","abstract":"In active learning, a machine learning algorithm is given an unlabeled set of examples U, and is allowed to request labels for a relatively small subset of U to use for training.

We argue that converting the scores into well-calibrated probability estimates is more favorable for several reasons. First, the probability estimates allow us to select the appropriate threshold for declaring outliers using a Bayesian risk model. Second, the probability estimates obtained from individual models can be aggregated to build an ensemble outlier detection framework. In this paper, we present two methods for transforming outlier scores into probabilities. The first approach assumes that the posterior probabilities follow a logistic sigmoid function and learns the parameters of the function from the distribution of outlier scores. The second approach models the score distributions as a mixture of exponential and Gaussian probability functions and calculates the posterior probabilites via the Bayes' rule. We evaluated the efficacy of both methods in the context of threshold selection and ensemble outlier detection. We also show that the calibration accuracy improves with the aid of some labeled examples.","doi":"10.1109/ICDM.2006.43","publicationTitle":"Sixth International Conference on Data Mining (ICDM'06)","startPage":"212","endPage":"221","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICDM.2006.43","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4053013","pdfPath":"/iel5/4053012/4053013/04053049.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"Sixth International Conference on Data Mining (ICDM'06)","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Detection algorithms","Calibration","Logistics","Computer science","Bayesian methods","Support vector machines","Support vector machine classification","State estimation","Probability","Costs"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Bayes methods","data handling","exponential distribution","Gaussian distribution"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["outlier detection algorithms","probability estimates","Bayesian risk model","posterior probabilities","logistic sigmoid function","outlier scores distribution","exponential probability functions","Gaussian probability functions"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Converting Output Scores from Outlier Detection Algorithms into Probability Estimates","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4053049/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4053049/","accessionNumber":"10222254","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"08 January 2007","publicationDate":"Dec. 2006","conferenceDate":"18-22 Dec. 2006","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"18-22 Dec. 2006","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Converting Output Scores from Outlier Detection Algorithms into Probability Estimates","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"270100212.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045424S","chronDate":"18-22 Dec. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4053012","isNumber":"4053013","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4053012","citationCount":"57","xplore-issue":"4053013","articleId":"4053049","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4053075,"authors":[{"name":"Roberto Perdisci","affiliation":["DIEE, University of Cagliari, Cagliari, Italy","College of Computing, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"firstName":"Roberto","lastName":"Perdisci","id":"37659865800"},{"name":"Guofei Gu","affiliation":["College of Computing, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"firstName":"Guofei","lastName":"Gu","id":"37068668500"},{"name":"Wenke Lee","affiliation":["College of Computing, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"firstName":"Wenke","lastName":"Lee","id":"37278522800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-2701-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-4786"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2374-8486"}],"articleNumber":"4053075","dbTime":"22 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":105,"citationCountPatent":14,"totalDownloads":1278},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Support vector machines","Support vector machine classification","Payloads","Intrusion detection","Statistics","Frequency measurement","Telecommunication traffic","Traffic control","Detectors","Feature extraction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer networks","feature extraction","pattern classification","pattern clustering","security of data","support vector machines","telecommunication computing","text analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["payload-based anomaly detection","unsupervised learning approach","unlabeled learning approach","network anomaly detection","payload statistics","padding technique","feature extraction","feature clustering algorithm","text classification problem"]}],"abstract":"Unsupervised or unlabeled learning approaches for network anomaly detection have been recently proposed. In particular, recent work on unlabeled anomaly detection focused on high speed classification based on simple payload statistics. For example, PAYL, an anomaly IDS, measures the occurrence frequency in the payload of n-grams. A simple model of normal traffic is then constructed according to this description of the packets' content. It has been demonstrated that anomaly detectors based on payload statistics can be \"evaded\" by mimicry attacks using byte substitution and padding techniques. In this paper we propose a new approach to construct high speed payload-based anomaly IDS intended to be accurate and hard to evade. We propose a new technique to extract the features from the payload. We use a feature clustering algorithm originally proposed for text classification problems to reduce the dimensionality of the feature space. Accuracy and hardness of evasion are obtained by constructing our anomaly-based IDS using an ensemble of one-class SVM classifiers that work on different feature spaces.","doi":"10.1109/ICDM.2006.165","publicationTitle":"Sixth International Conference on Data Mining (ICDM'06)","displayPublicationTitle":"Sixth International Conference on Data Mining (ICDM'06)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4053012/4053013/04053075.pdf","startPage":"488","endPage":"498","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICDM.2006.165","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4053013","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Using an Ensemble of One-Class SVM Classifiers to Harden Payload-based Anomaly Detection Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4053075","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-22 Dec. 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4053075/","displayDocTitle":"Using an Ensemble of One-Class SVM Classifiers to Harden Payload-based Anomaly Detection Systems","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2006","accessionNumber":"10208356","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4053075/","conferenceDate":"18-22 Dec. 2006","dateOfInsertion":"08 January 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Using an Ensemble of One-Class SVM Classifiers to Harden Payload-based Anomaly Detection Systems","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"270100488.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071463S","chronDate":"18-22 Dec. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4053012","isNumber":"4053013","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4053012","citationCount":"105","xplore-issue":"4053013","articleId":"4053075","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-20"},{"_id":4053085,"authors":[{"name":"Yanmin Sun","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Waterloo, Waterloo, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Yanmin","lastName":"Sun","id":"37694638300"},{"name":"Mohamed S.

This learning difficulty attracts a lot of research interests. Most efforts concentrate on bi-class problems. However, bi-class is not the only scenario where the class imbalance problem prevails. Reported solutions for bi-class applications are not applicable to multi-class problems. In this paper, we develop a cost-sensitive boosting algorithm to improve the classification performance of imbalanced data involving multiple classes. One barrier of applying the cost-sensitive boosting algorithm to the imbalanced data is that the cost matrix is often unavailable for a problem domain. To solve this problem, we apply Genetic Algorithm to search the optimum cost setup of each class. Empirical tests show that the proposed cost-sensitive boosting algorithm improves the classification performances of imbalanced data sets significantly.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Boosting","Iterative algorithms","Data mining","Cost function","Testing","Classification algorithms","Sun","Software systems","Drives","Software standards"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data mining","genetic algorithms","learning (artificial intelligence)","pattern classification"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["imbalanced class distribution","data classification","classifier learning algorithm","cost-sensitive boosting algorithm","genetic algorithm","multiple classes imbalance learning","boosting algorithm"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICDM.2006.29","publicationTitle":"Sixth International Conference on Data Mining (ICDM'06)","displayPublicationTitle":"Sixth International Conference on Data Mining (ICDM'06)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4053012/4053013/04053085.pdf","startPage":"592","endPage":"602","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4053013","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICDM.2006.29","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Boosting for Learning Multiple Classes with Imbalanced Class Distribution","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4053085","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Boosting for Learning Multiple Classes with Imbalanced Class Distribution","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4053085/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2006","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4053085/","accessionNumber":"10222272","conferenceDate":"18-22 Dec. 2006","dateOfInsertion":"08 January 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-22 Dec. 2006","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Boosting for Learning Multiple Classes with Imbalanced Class Distribution","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"270100592.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.08519S","chronDate":"18-22 Dec. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4053012","isNumber":"4053013","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4053012","citationCount":"126","xplore-issue":"4053013","articleId":"4053085","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-04"},{"_id":4053087,"authors":[{"name":"Hanghang Tong","affiliation":["Carnegie Mellon University, USA"],"firstName":"Hanghang","lastName":"Tong","id":"37414263500"},{"name":"Christos Faloutsos","affiliation":["Carnegie Mellon University, USA"],"firstName":"Christos","lastName":"Faloutsos","id":"37271732500"},{"name":"Jia-yu Pan","affiliation":["Carnegie Mellon University, USA"],"firstName":"Jia-yu","lastName":"Pan","id":"37420391000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-2701-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-4786"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2374-8486"}],"articleNumber":"4053087","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":376,"citationCountPatent":4,"totalDownloads":2225},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Costs","Sparse matrices","Delay","Image storage","Niobium","Time factors","Heart","Linearity","Error analysis","Design optimization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["graph theory","random processes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["random walk with restart","weighted graph","connection subgraphs","low-rank matrix approximation","Sherman-Morrison lemma","graph partitioning","matrix inversion"]}],"abstract":"How closely related are two nodes in a graph? How to compute this score quickly, on huge, disk-resident, real graphs? Random walk with restart (RWR) provides a good relevance score between two nodes in a weighted graph, and it has been successfully used in numerous settings, like automatic captioning of images, generalizations to the \"connection subgraphs\", personalized PageRank, and many more. However, the straightforward implementations of RWR do not scale for large graphs, requiring either quadratic space and cubic pre-computation time, or slow response time on queries. We propose fast solutions to this problem. The heart of our approach is to exploit two important properties shared by many real graphs: (a) linear correlations and (b) block- wise, community-like structure. We exploit the linearity by using low-rank matrix approximation, and the community structure by graph partitioning, followed by the Sherman- Morrison lemma for matrix inversion.

We developed a technique for efficiently computing the lower and upper bounds of the distance between a given point and its k\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">th</sup>\n nearest neighbor in each possible subspace. These bounds are used to speed up the fitness evaluation of the designed genetic algorithm for outlying subspace detection. We also proposed a random sampling technique to further reduce the computation of the genetic algorithm. The optimal number of sampling data is specified to ensure the accuracy of the result. We show that the proposed method is efficient and effective in handling outlying subspace detection problem by a set of experiments conducted on both synthetic and real-life datasets.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-22 Dec. 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4053098/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10208368","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4053098/","publicationDate":"Dec. 2006","dateOfInsertion":"08 January 2007","conferenceDate":"18-22 Dec. 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A Novel Method for Detecting Outlying Subspaces in High-dimensional Databases Using Genetic Algorithm","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Novel Method for Detecting Outlying Subspaces in High-dimensional Databases Using Genetic Algorithm","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"270100731.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.081179S","chronDate":"18-22 Dec. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4053012","isNumber":"4053013","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4053012","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"4053013","articleId":"4053098","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4053119,"authors":[{"name":"Murat Can Ganiz","affiliation":["CSE Department, Lehigh University, Bethlehem, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Murat Can","lastName":"Ganiz","id":"37698225000"},{"name":"Sudhan Kanitkar","affiliation":["CSE Department, Lehigh University, Bethlehem, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Sudhan","lastName":"Kanitkar","id":"37838891600"},{"name":"Mooi Choo Chuah","affiliation":["CSE Department, Lehigh University, Bethlehem, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Mooi Choo","lastName":"Chuah","id":"37269467800"},{"name":"William M.

Thus, the ability to detect and categorize such events is extremely useful. In this article we present a novel anomaly detection technique for BGP that distinguishes between different anomalies in BGP traffic. This technique is termed higher order path analysis (HOPA) and focuses on the discovery of patterns in higher order paths in supervised learning datasets. Our results demonstrate that not only worm events but also different types of worms as well as blackout events are cleanly separable and can be classified in real time based on our incremental approach. This novel approach to supervised learning has potential applications in cybersecurity/forensics and text/data mining in general.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Detection of Interdomain Routing Anomalies Based on Higher-Order Path Analysis","publicationTitle":"Sixth International Conference on Data Mining (ICDM'06)","doi":"10.1109/ICDM.2006.52","displayPublicationTitle":"Sixth International Conference on Data Mining (ICDM'06)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4053012/4053013/04053119.pdf","startPage":"874","endPage":"879","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICDM.2006.52","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4053013","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4053119","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4053119/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-22 Dec. 2006","displayDocTitle":"Detection of Interdomain Routing Anomalies Based on Higher-Order Path Analysis","conferenceDate":"18-22 Dec. 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4053119/","dateOfInsertion":"08 January 2007","publicationDate":"Dec. 2006","accessionNumber":"10222294","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Detection of Interdomain Routing Anomalies Based on Higher-Order Path Analysis","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"270100874.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073439S","chronDate":"18-22 Dec. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4053012","isNumber":"4053013","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4053012","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"4053013","articleId":"4053119","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4053125,"authors":[{"name":"Robert Jaschke","affiliation":["Knowledge & Data Engineering Group, University of Kassel, Germany"],"firstName":"Robert","lastName":"Jaschke","id":"38242977000"},{"name":"Andreas Hotho","affiliation":["Knowledge & Data Engineering Group, University of Kassel, Germany"],"firstName":"Andreas","lastName":"Hotho","id":"37426705400"},{"name":"Christoph Schmitz","affiliation":["Knowledge & Data Engineering Group, University of Kassel, Germany"],"firstName":"Christoph","lastName":"Schmitz","id":"38180486500"},{"name":"Bernhard Ganter","affiliation":["Institute for Algebra, Dresden University of Technology, Germany"],"firstName":"Bernhard","lastName":"Ganter","id":"37833039900"},{"name":"Gerd Stumme","affiliation":["Knowledge & Data Engineering Group, University of Kassel, Germany"],"firstName":"Gerd","lastName":"Stumme","id":"38550404900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-2701-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-4786"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2374-8486"}],"articleNumber":"4053125","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":58,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":154},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"TRIAS--An Algorithm for Mining Iceberg Tri-Lattices","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Data mining","Itemsets","Resource management","Algorithm design and analysis","Association rules","Data structures","Data engineering","Algebra","Lattices","Clustering algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data analysis","data mining"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["TRIAS algorithm","iceberg tri-lattice mining","frequent tri-concept mining","3D data","folksonomy mining","triadic formal concept analysis"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4053125","abstract":"In this paper, we present the foundations for mining frequent tri-concepts, which extend the notion of closed item-sets to three-dimensional data to allow for mining folk-sonomies.

Especially in the domestic area, public buildings, and office buildings, energy supply systems have to be optimized swiftly balancing with the time-dependent energy demand. This paper discusses the exemplary energy assessment of the cogeneration and air-conditioning system on Keio University Shonan Fujisawa Campus with approximately 5,000 students and 200 faculty members. The purpose of the cogeneration system consisting of prime mover and exhaust heat recovery equipment is a contribution to energy conservation. Exhaust heat of the prime mover can be reutilized in form of heated or chilled water by the exhaust heat recovery equipment. Optimized reutilization of exhaust heat shall bring the main benefit for energy conservation. Therefore, the effectiveness of the cogeneration system has been evaluated based on collected annual data of energy consumption on the campus. Furthermore, curtailment of air-conditioning systems during peak load caused by the congestion of the grid power has been examined. In order to optimize the energy management under these conditions, the forecast of power consumption has been discussed, and the relation of power consumption to air temperature has been examined.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4053419/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-18 Aug. 2006","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"16-18 Aug. 2006","htmlLink":"/document/4053419/","dateOfInsertion":"08 January 2007","publicationDate":"Aug. 2006","accessionNumber":"10222094","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Energy Assessment of Cogeneration and Air Conditioning System on Keio University Shonan Fujisawa Campus","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy Assessment of Cogeneration and Air Conditioning System on Keio University Shonan Fujisawa Campus","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"INDIN-00-83.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064088S","chronDate":"16-18 Aug. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4053335","isNumber":"4053336","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4053335","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4053336","articleId":"4053419","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4053495,"authors":[{"name":"Zhaojin Wen","affiliation":["School of Automation, Beijing Aeronautics and Astronautics University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Zhaojin","lastName":"Wen","id":"37704157900"},{"name":"Weihai Chen","affiliation":["Singapore Institute of Manufacturing Technology, Singapore"],"firstName":"Weihai","lastName":"Chen","id":"37279188000"},{"name":"Zhiyue Xu","affiliation":["School of Automation, Beijing Aeronautics and Astronautics University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Zhiyue","lastName":"Xu","id":"37710501500"},{"name":"Jianhua Wang","affiliation":["School of Automation, Beijing Aeronautics and Astronautics University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Jianhua","lastName":"Wang","id":"37539004800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"0-7803-9701-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-9700-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1935-4576"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2378-363X"}],"articleNumber":"4053495","dbTime":"15 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":13,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":772},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Field programmable gate arrays","Micromotors","Motion control","Programmable logic arrays","Programmable logic devices","Programmable control","Heart","Table lookup","Hardware","Logic design"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electric current control","field programmable gate arrays","machine control","motion control","motor drives","programmable controllers","stepping motors","table lookup"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["two-phase stepper motor driver","FPGA","field programmable gate array","motion control","programmable logic control","sine/cosine microstepper method","look-up table","current control"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4053495","abstract":"In order to achieve both high speed and high precision for motion control, a controller with flexible algorithm and programmable logic will be expected.

The ability of A-CMN to adapt to a wide range of source statistics is demonstrated by simulation results.","doi":"10.1109/MLSP.2006.275526","publicationTitle":"2006 16th IEEE Signal Processing Society Workshop on Machine Learning for Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 16th IEEE Signal Processing Society Workshop on Machine Learning for Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4053604/4053605/04053625.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MLSP.2006.275526","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4053605","startPage":"79","endPage":"84","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptable Nonlinearity for Complex Maximization of Nongaussianity and a Fixed-Point Algorithm","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4053625","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Adaptable Nonlinearity for Complex Maximization of Nongaussianity and a Fixed-Point Algorithm","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-8 Sept. 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4053625/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"6-8 Sept. 2006","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2006","accessionNumber":"10185034","dateOfInsertion":"08 January 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4053625/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptable Nonlinearity for Complex Maximization of Nongaussianity and a Fixed-Point Algorithm","confLoc":"Maynooth, Ireland","sourcePdf":"MLSP-00-20.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042973S","chronDate":"6-8 Sept. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4053604","isNumber":"4053605","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4053604","citationCount":"24","xplore-issue":"4053605","articleId":"4053625","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":4053626,"authors":[{"name":"Hualiang Li","affiliation":["University of Maryland Baltimore County, Baltimore, MD, USA"],"firstName":"Hualiang","lastName":"Li","id":"37293384900"},{"name":"Tulay Adali","affiliation":["University of Maryland Baltimore County, Baltimore, MD, USA"],"firstName":"Tulay","lastName":"Adali","id":"37284803700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0657-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0656-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1551-2541"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2378-928X"}],"articleNumber":"4053626","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":15,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":273},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Independent component analysis","Cost function","Algorithm design and analysis","Iterative algorithms","Vectors","Sufficient conditions","Biomedical imaging","Image analysis","Radar applications","Radar imaging"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["gradient methods","independent component analysis","optimisation","signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["gradient algorithm","fixed-point algorithm","ICA","kurtosis maximization","independent component analysis","complex-valued signal","cost function","Brandwood analyticity condition"]}],"abstract":"We present two algorithms for independent component analysis of complex-valued signals based on the maximization of absolute value of kurtosis and establish their properties.

When the language of the input text is not known, usually the first step is to identify the language and, based on this information, the text- to-phoneme mapping is done.

However, this technique often ignores available contextual information that may be influential to the state of an entity, sacrificing remote predictive accuracy in favour of low computational complexity. In this paper, we present a novel extension of dead reckoning by employing neural- networks to take into account expected future entity behaviour during the transmission of entity state updates (ESUs) for remote entity modeling in DIAs. This proposed method succeeds in reducing network traffic through a decrease in the frequency of ESU transmission required to maintain consistency. Validation is achieved through simulation in a highly interactive DIA, and results indicate significant potential for improved scalability when compared to the use of the IEEE DIS Standard dead reckoning technique. The new method exhibits relatively low computational overhead and seamless integration with current dead reckoning schemes.","doi":"10.1109/MLSP.2006.275564","startPage":"295","endPage":"300","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 16th IEEE Signal Processing Society Workshop on Machine Learning for Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4053604/4053605/04053663.pdf","publicationTitle":"2006 16th IEEE Signal Processing Society Workshop on Machine Learning for Signal Processing","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MLSP.2006.275564","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4053605","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Using Neural-Networks to Reduce Entity State Updates in Distributed Interactive Applications","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Dead reckoning","Traffic control","Delay","Telecommunication traffic","Bandwidth","Contracts","Accuracy","Computational complexity","Frequency","Scalability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed processing","groupware","neural nets","virtual reality"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neural network","distributed interactive application","entity state update","dead reckoning","predictive contract mechanism","network traffic","computational complexity","remote entity modeling","virtual reality"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4053663/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-8 Sept. 2006","displayDocTitle":"Using Neural-Networks to Reduce Entity State Updates in Distributed Interactive Applications","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4053663/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2006","dateOfInsertion":"08 January 2007","conferenceDate":"6-8 Sept. 2006","accessionNumber":"10185069","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Using Neural-Networks to Reduce Entity State Updates in Distributed Interactive Applications","confLoc":"Maynooth, Ireland","sourcePdf":"MLSP-00-58.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071377S","chronDate":"6-8 Sept. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4053604","isNumber":"4053605","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4053604","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4053605","articleId":"4053663","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":4053664,"authors":[{"name":"Mark A.

Thus networks are specialized in learning and depicting non-linear spatial inter-pixel correlations at respective gradients and directions.

Such problems are often subproblems within larger systems. When gradient optimisation of the entire larger system is desired, it is necessary to propagate gradients through the internally-invoked LP solver. For instance, when an intermediate quantity z is the solution to a linear program involving constraint matrix A, a vector of sensitivities dE/dz will induce sensitivities dE/dA. Here we show how these can be efficiently calculated, when they exist. This allows algorithmic differentiation to be applied to algorithms that invoke linear programming solvers as subroutines, as is common when using sparse representations in signal processing. Here we apply it to gradient optimisation of over complete dictionaries for maximally sparse representations of a speech corpus. The dictionaries are employed in a single-channel speech separation task, leading to 5 dB and 8 dB target-to-interference ratio improvements for same-gender and opposite-gender mixtures, respectively. Furthermore, the dictionaries are successfully applied to a speaker identification task.","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 16th IEEE Signal Processing Society Workshop on Machine Learning for Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4053604/4053605/04053686.pdf","startPage":"421","endPage":"426","publicationTitle":"2006 16th IEEE Signal Processing Society Workshop on Machine Learning for Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/MLSP.2006.275587","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MLSP.2006.275587","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4053605","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4053686","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Linear Program Differentiation for Single-Channel Speech Separation","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Dictionaries","Signal processing algorithms","Linear programming","Equations","Speech enhancement","Vectors","Gradient methods","Informatics","Mathematical model","Sparse matrices"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["differentiation","gradient methods","linear programming","matrix algebra","signal representation","speaker recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["linear program differentiation","single-channel speech separation","linear programming","gradient optimisation","constraint matrix","sparse representation","signal processing","speaker identification task"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4053686/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-8 Sept. 2006","displayDocTitle":"Linear Program Differentiation for Single-Channel Speech Separation","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4053686/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2006","accessionNumber":"10185090","dateOfInsertion":"08 January 2007","conferenceDate":"6-8 Sept. 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Linear Program Differentiation for Single-Channel Speech Separation","confLoc":"Maynooth, Ireland","sourcePdf":"MLSP-00-81.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.028698S","chronDate":"6-8 Sept. 2006","isNumber":"4053605","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4053604","citationCount":"7","articleId":"4053686","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4053687,"authors":[{"name":"Paul D.

The feed-forward method is primarily used to suppress intermodulation distortion in amplifiers to suppress up-converted near-DC noise. The main amplifier in this configuration is a low-noise array of eight amplifiers in parallel and having a phase noise of -165 dBc/Hz at f = 10 kHz. By implementing a feed-forward scheme, we are able to suppress this noise, as well as close-to-carrier noise, by at least another 10 dB. This improved performance surpasses that of other present low-noise microwave amplifiers. We discuss this exceptional performance in the context of trade-offs with other amplifier properties and specifications. We also construct a 10 GHz oscillator using an air-dielectric resonator and the FFA as the loop amplifier. The phase modulated (PM) noise of this particular oscillator is either less than or comparable to the PM noise of several classes of commercial oscillators.

In this paper we motivate the robust detection and estimation problem using recent results for cooperative sensing in cognitive radios and multi-object tracking in sensor networks. As a first step, we formulate an abstract version of the problem that is solved under different assumptions. We use expectation maximization (EM) framework to successfully weed out the lying nodes. We consider different types of lying behavior. In the simplistic case of liars behaving the same over all observations. In the more complex cases, the lying behavior of the users changes over time. The solution to the problem of detection in the presence of lying nodes has been developed from two view points. In the first case we consider the binary variable being detected as a latent variable, and in the second case we consider the binary variable as a parameter. The results under the two schemes are presented and compared. In all of the cases considered in this paper, we show that the factors that maximally impact the estimation/decision process are the mean of the liars, the variance of the channel, and the number of observations","doi":"10.1109/MOBHOC.2006.278562","startPage":"236","endPage":"245","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Conference on Mobile Ad Hoc and Sensor Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4053889/4053890/04053908.pdf","publicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Conference on Mobile Ad Hoc and Sensor Systems","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MOBHOC.2006.278562","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4053890","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robust Estimation and Detection in Ad Hoc and Sensor Networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Robustness","Radio spectrum management","Cognitive radio","Computer networks","FCC","Wireless sensor networks","Frequency","Algorithm design and analysis","Gaussian noise","Working environment noise"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ad hoc networks","cognitive radio","decision theory","expectation-maximisation algorithm","tracking","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["robust estimation","robust detection","ad hoc networks","sensor networks","cooperative sensing","cognitive radio","multiobject tracking","expectation maximization","binary variable","decision process"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4053908/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2006","displayDocTitle":"Robust Estimation and Detection in Ad Hoc and Sensor Networks","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4053908/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2006","dateOfInsertion":"15 January 2007","conferenceDate":"9-12 Oct. 2006","accessionNumber":"9296705","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust Estimation and Detection in Ad Hoc and Sensor Networks","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"MOBHOC-00-18.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046222S","chronDate":"Oct.  2006","xplore-pub-id":"4053889","isNumber":"4053890","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4053889","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4053890","articleId":"4053908","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4053916,"authors":[{"name":"Wenrui Zhao","affiliation":["College of Computing, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, Georgia, USA"],"firstName":"Wenrui","lastName":"Zhao","id":"37833992700"},{"name":"Yang Chen","affiliation":["College of Computing, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, Georgia, USA"],"firstName":"Yang","lastName":"Chen","id":"37281026800"},{"name":"Mostafa Ammar","affiliation":["College of Computing, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, Georgia"],"firstName":"Mostafa","lastName":"Ammar","id":"37271820200"},{"name":"Mark Corner","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Massachusetts, Amherst, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Mark","lastName":"Corner","id":"37303872100"},{"name":"Brian Levine","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Massachusetts, Amherst, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Brian","lastName":"Levine","id":"37285138500"},{"name":"Ellen Zegura","affiliation":["College of Computing, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, Georgia, USA"],"firstName":"Ellen","lastName":"Zegura","id":"37295217600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0506-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0507-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2155-6806"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2155-6814"}],"articleNumber":"4053916","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":140,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":377},"abstract":"Disruption tolerant networks (DTNs) are designed to overcome limitations in connectivity due to conditions such as mobility, poor infrastructure, and short range radios. DTNs rely on the inherent mobility in the network to deliver packets around frequent and extended network partitions using a store-carry-and-forward paradigm. However, missed contact opportunities decrease throughput and increase delay in the network. We propose the use of throwboxes in mobile DTNs to create a greater number of contact opportunities, consequently improving the performance of the network. Throwboxes are wireless nodes that act as relays, creating additional contact opportunities in the DTN. We propose algorithms to deploy stationary throwboxes in the network that simultaneously consider routing as well as placement. We also present placement algorithms that use more limited knowledge about the network structure. We perform an extensive evaluation of our algorithms by varying both the underlying routing and mobility models. Our results suggest several findings to guide the design and operation of throwbox-augmented DTNs","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Disruption tolerant networking","Routing","Throughput","Relays","Performance evaluation","Educational institutions","Computer networks","Computer science","Data communication","Telecommunication network reliability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mobile radio","telecommunication network routing","telecommunication network topology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["disruption tolerant network","mobile DTN","store-carry-forward paradigm","throwbox","network performance","wireless node","network routing","placement algorithm","capacity enhancement"]}],"doi":"10.1109/MOBHOC.2006.278570","publicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Conference on Mobile Ad Hoc and Sensor Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Conference on Mobile Ad Hoc and Sensor Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4053889/4053890/04053916.pdf","startPage":"31","endPage":"40","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4053890","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MOBHOC.2006.278570","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Capacity Enhancement using Throwboxes in DTNs","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4053916","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Capacity Enhancement using Throwboxes in DTNs","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4053916/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2006","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4053916/","accessionNumber":"9296690","conferenceDate":"9-12 Oct. 2006","dateOfInsertion":"15 January 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-12 Oct. 2006","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Capacity Enhancement using Throwboxes in DTNs","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"MOBHOC-00-26.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.075399S","chronDate":"9-12 Oct. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4053889","isNumber":"4053890","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4053889","citationCount":"140","xplore-issue":"4053890","articleId":"4053916","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4053930,"authors":[{"name":"Zhiying Yao","affiliation":["Electronics Telecommunications, Research Institute, South Korea"],"firstName":"Zhiying","lastName":"Yao","id":"37828021400"},{"name":"Daeyoung Kim","affiliation":["South Korea"],"firstName":"Daeyoung","lastName":"Kim","id":"37279318300"},{"name":"Yoonmee Doh","affiliation":["Electronics Telecommunications, Research Institute, South Korea"],"firstName":"Yoonmee","lastName":"Doh","id":"37271523300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0506-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0507-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2155-6806"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2155-6814"}],"articleNumber":"4053930","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":57,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":323},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wireless sensor networks","Information security","Data security","Intrusion detection","Sensor phenomena and characterization","Cryptography","Routing","Intelligent sensors","Computer crime","Communication system security"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cryptography","telecommunication network management","telecommunication security","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["PLUS","parameterized-localized trust management scheme","sensor networks security","cryptographic methods"]}],"abstract":"The wireless and resource-constraint nature of a sensor network makes it an ideal medium for attackers to do any kinds of vicious things.

Special focus was given to wireless sensor networks (WSN) and sensor/actuator networks (SANET). Looking at the most pressing issues in such networks, the limited resources and the huge amount of interoperating nodes, the proposed solutions primarily intend to solve the scalability problems by reducing the overhead in data communication. Well-known examples are data-centric routing approaches and probabilistic techniques. In this paper, we intend to go one step further. We are about to also move the operation and control for WSN and SANET into the network. Inspired by the operation of complex biological systems such as the cellular information exchange, we propose a network-centric approach. Our method is based on three concepts: data-centric operation, specific reaction on received data, and simple local behavior control using a policy-based state machine.

We have recently demonstrated the feasibility of nano-axotomy in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans) and observed nerve regeneration of the severed axons. Neural regeneration process can be impaired by the amount of collateral damage. Such damage is due to expansion of the thermoelastic stress-induced cavitation bubbles and the shock-waves expanding beyond the focal volume of the laser beam. This study presents a systematic characterization of the extent of damage in C. elegans created by 100-fs pulses at 1-kHz repetition rate with energies varying from 2-nJ to 20-nJ per pulse and the total number of pulses ranging from 1 to 1000. The minimum energy required for ablation greatly depends on the total number of pulses used. While a single shot of 21-nJ of energy can severe an axon, the threshold drops to as low as 3.8-nJ for 1000 pulses","doi":"10.1109/LEOS.2006.278911","publicationTitle":"LEOS 2006 - 19th Annual Meeting of the IEEE Lasers and Electro-Optics Society","displayPublicationTitle":"LEOS 2006 - 19th Annual Meeting of the IEEE Lasers and Electro-Optics Society","pdfPath":"/iel5/4054018/4054019/04054093.pdf","startPage":"136","endPage":"137","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LEOS.2006.278911","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4054019","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Femtosecond Laser Nano-Surgery for Nerve Regeneration Studies","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4054093","pubTopics":[{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct. 29 2006-Nov. 2 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4054093/","displayDocTitle":"Femtosecond Laser Nano-Surgery for Nerve Regeneration Studies","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2006","accessionNumber":"9352843","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4054093/","conferenceDate":"29 Oct.-2 Nov. 2006","dateOfInsertion":"15 January 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Femtosecond Laser Nano-Surgery for Nerve Regeneration Studies","confLoc":"Montreal, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"LEOS-00-74.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046082S","chronDate":"Oct. 29 2006-Nov. 2 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4054018","isNumber":"4054019","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4054018","xplore-issue":"4054019","articleId":"4054093","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4054096,"authors":[{"name":"Yoshimasa Kawata","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical Engineering, Shizuoka University, Hamamatsu, Japan"],"firstName":"Yoshimasa","lastName":"Kawata","id":"37284493400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-9556-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"0-7803-9555-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1092-8081"}],"articleNumber":"4054096","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":39},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Memory","Optical recording","Coatings","Optical buffering","Optical films","Optical sensors","Optical reflection","Microscopy","Fabrication","Crosstalk"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adhesives","optical fabrication","optical materials","optical multilayers","optical storage"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multilayered optical memory","data storage","photosensitive recording layer","transparent layer","wet coating fabrication","laminating process","pressure sensitive adhesive","data recording"]}],"abstract":"We have developed a multilayered medium in which photosensitive recording layers and transparent layers are piled up alternately in order to increase signal to noise ratio.

A novel approach called seamless vertical handover for mobile IPv6 (SVHO) is defined to allow a mobile node to resume its real-time ongoing session with its correspondent as soon as it attaches to the new link. Traffic in progress will be redirected to the new network using mobile user's previous care-of-address through preconfigured bidirectional tunnels. By this means, the service disruption for an ongoing real-time session could be minimized. Moreover, since the context information for the session in progress run by the mobile is kept intact at the previous access router, the delay variation (jitter) is reduced significantly during handoff. To provide certain quality of service to roaming users, new functionalities are added at access router so that it can perform not only local resource management but also call admission control as the mobile moves between subnets. To evaluate the performance, the components of handover latency are identified to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Numerical results show that our new method has better performance than the brute-force handoff, the seamless handoff and the optimized seamless handoff scheme existing in the literature","doi":"10.1109/CCECE.2006.277372","publicationTitle":"2006 Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/4054516/4054517/04054522.pdf","startPage":"214","endPage":"218","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CCECE.2006.277372","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4054517","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A New Seamless Method to Support CDMA2000/WLAN Vertical Handover","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4054522","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-10 May 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4054522/","displayDocTitle":"A New Seamless Method to Support CDMA2000/WLAN Vertical Handover","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2006","accessionNumber":"9364963","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4054522/","conferenceDate":"7-10 May 2006","dateOfInsertion":"15 January 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A New Seamless Method to Support CDMA2000/WLAN Vertical Handover","confLoc":"Ottawa, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"CCECE-00-5.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049866S","chronDate":"7-10 May 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4054516","isNumber":"4054517","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4054516","xplore-issue":"4054517","articleId":"4054522","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4054529,"authors":[{"name":"E.S.

Two experiments were conducted. In experiment 1, manipulated images were used to train the ANN. In experiment 2 a database of forged images was used.

In this paper, a new deblocking algorithm based on wavelet transform and Markov random field (MRF) is proposed. The blocking-artifacts image is firstly processed with a simple and effective wavelet-based deblocking algorithm using the two-scale wavelet scheme. Adaptive operators for different subbands can be computed to suppress blocking effects below the visual scope. It can make the image smoother, which provides advantage for the following MRF-based deblocking method. The proper threshold value for Huber function plays an important role in MRF method. The linear regression is used to adaptively estimate the threshold value. Experimental results show that the new algorithm has low computational cost and achieves improved image quality in both subjective and objective measurement","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/4054516/4054517/04054556.pdf","startPage":"1944","endPage":"1947","publicationTitle":"2006 Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering","doi":"10.1109/CCECE.2006.277443","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CCECE.2006.277443","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4054517","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4054556","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A New Deblocking Algorithm Based on Wavelet Transform and MRF for DCT-Coded Images","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wavelet transforms","Image quality","Decoding","Image coding","Discrete transforms","Bit rate","Markov random fields","Transform coding","Wavelet domain","Discrete wavelet transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data compression","decoding","discrete cosine transforms","image coding","Markov processes","random processes","regression analysis","wavelet transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["discrete cosine transform","DCT","blocking artifact","deblocking algorithm","wavelet transform","Markov random field","Huber function","linear regression","image coding"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Blocking artifacts","Markov random field","wavelet transform"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4054556/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2006","displayDocTitle":"A New Deblocking Algorithm Based on Wavelet Transform and MRF for DCT-Coded Images","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4054556/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2006","accessionNumber":"9376439","dateOfInsertion":"15 January 2007","conferenceDate":"7-10 May 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A New Deblocking Algorithm Based on Wavelet Transform and MRF for DCT-Coded Images","confLoc":"Ottawa, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"CCECE-00-39.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052593S","chronDate":"May  2006","xplore-pub-id":"4054516","isNumber":"4054517","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4054516","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4054517","articleId":"4054556","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4054564,"authors":[{"name":"Shaikh K.

Basically, the six-port circuit is an additive mixer in which the resulting sum of millimeter-wave signals is nonlinearly processed using millimeter-wave detectors.

This alignment is essential for decoding the spread spectrum signal. The customary approach is to start each CDMA packet with a data-free preamble that facilitates codephase alignment in the receiver. Since packets can be short, processing must be rapid and so we use the parallel processing of a transversal matched filter correlator. We include segmentation of the matched filter to allow codephase testing even when there are data transitions. This eliminates the need for a preamble and the entire packet can contain data. Segmentation also increases tolerance to Doppler shifts caused by motion or by carrier frequency mismatch. To increase the probability of correct codephase acquisition, matched filter samples are accumulated over several code cycles prior to making the codephase decision. Correct detection probabilities exceeding 99% are indicated from simulations with 25 co-users and 10 kHz Doppler shift","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/4054516/4054517/04054599.pdf","startPage":"464","endPage":"467","publicationTitle":"2006 Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering","doi":"10.1109/CCECE.2006.277542","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CCECE.2006.277542","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4054517","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4054599","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Packet CDMA Communication without Preambles","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multiaccess communication","Matched filters","Frequency synchronization","Correlators","Testing","Spread spectrum communication","Performance evaluation","Decoding","Doppler shift","Frequency conversion"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiple access","correlators","decoding","matched filters","packet radio networks","probability","spread spectrum communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["direct-sequence CDMA packet communication","chip codephase alignment","spread spectrum signal decoding","data-free preamble","parallel processing","transversal segmented matched filter correlator","codephase testing","data transition","Doppler shift","codephase acquisition"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["packet CDMA","code acquisition","segmented matched filter"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4054599/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2006","displayDocTitle":"Packet CDMA Communication without Preambles","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4054599/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2006","accessionNumber":"9364986","dateOfInsertion":"15 January 2007","conferenceDate":"7-10 May 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Packet CDMA Communication without Preambles","confLoc":"Ottawa, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"CCECE-00-82.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050946S","chronDate":"May  2006","xplore-pub-id":"4054516","isNumber":"4054517","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4054516","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4054517","articleId":"4054599","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4054601,"authors":[{"name":"Jian Lin","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Lakehead University, Thunder Bay, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Jian","lastName":"Lin","id":"37557915000"},{"name":"Zhiwei Mao","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Lakehead University, Thunder Bay, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Zhiwei","lastName":"Mao","id":"37269957100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0038-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0840-7789"}],"articleNumber":"4054601","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":49},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Real time systems","Resource management","Intersymbol interference","Quality of service","Bit error rate","Data engineering","Lakes","Frequency conversion","Constraint optimization","Power distribution"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel allocation","frequency division multiple access","multiuser channels","OFDM modulation","optimisation","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["real-time radio resource allocation optimization problem","OFDMA system","orthogonal frequency division multiple access system","greedy approach","bits-feeding algorithm","computational complexity","multiuser channel"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Multiuser channel","OFDMA","radio resource allocation"]}],"abstract":"Radio resource allocation (RRA) problem for orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) system is considered in this paper.

The embedded continual pilot tones in DVB-T are utilized to perform the coarse timing recovery with low system complexity. The inherent cyclic prefix (CP) of the DVB-T symbol is used for CFO estimation. By means of simulations, the proposed coarse timing method shows excellent robustness even at a very low SNR for the continuous transmission mode, and is also suitable for burst mode. In addition, the performance of the designed CFO estimator is close to the Cramer-Rao lower bound, increases for increasing delay of multipath spread and the number of receive antennas, and also performs as expected with timing estimation errors, which all agree well with the theoretical results","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Combination of Coarse Symbol Timing and Carrier Frequency Offset (CFO) Estimation Techniques for MIMO OFDM Systems","publicationTitle":"2006 Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering","doi":"10.1109/CCECE.2006.277549","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/4054516/4054517/04054606.pdf","startPage":"472","endPage":"477","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CCECE.2006.277549","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4054517","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4054606","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4054606/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2006","displayDocTitle":"Combination of Coarse Symbol Timing and Carrier Frequency Offset (CFO) Estimation Techniques for MIMO OFDM Systems","conferenceDate":"7-10 May 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4054606/","dateOfInsertion":"15 January 2007","publicationDate":"May 2006","accessionNumber":"9364990","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Combination of Coarse Symbol Timing and Carrier Frequency Offset (CFO) Estimation Techniques for MIMO OFDM Systems","confLoc":"Ottawa, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"CCECE-00-89.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05027S","chronDate":"May  2006","xplore-pub-id":"4054516","isNumber":"4054517","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4054516","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4054517","articleId":"4054606","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":4054612,"authors":[{"name":"Jaeho Chung","affiliation":["Research and Development Group, Network Infra Laboratory, South Korea"],"firstName":"Jaeho","lastName":"Chung","id":"37833481500"},{"name":"Se-jun Park","affiliation":["Research and Development Group, Network Infra Laboratory, South Korea"],"firstName":"Se-jun","lastName":"Park","id":"37836099800"},{"name":"Seong-choon Lee","affiliation":["Research and Development Group, Network Infra Laboratory, South Korea"],"firstName":"Seong-choon","lastName":"Lee","id":"37836359400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0038-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0840-7789"}],"articleNumber":"4054612","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":310},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4054612","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Channel estimation","Fading","Bit error rate","MIMO","Transmitters","Laboratories","Research and development","Telecommunications","Receiving antennas","Convolution"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","convolutional codes","correlation methods","diversity reception","error statistics","fading channels","MIMO communication","OFDM modulation","quadrature amplitude modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","bit error rate performance","BER","convolutional code","MIMO-OFDM system","multiple input multiple output","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","multilevel quadrature amplitude modulation","M-QAM","spatial correlated fading channel","antenna diversity"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["MIMO","OFDM","Spatial Multiplexing","Channel Estimation Error","Correlated Fading Channel"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4054517","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering","publicationTitle":"2006 Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering","doi":"10.1109/CCECE.2006.277555","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Effect of Channel Estimation Errors on the Performance of MIMO-OFDM Systems in Correlated Fading Channels","startPage":"478","endPage":"481","pdfPath":"/iel5/4054516/4054517/04054612.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CCECE.2006.277555","abstract":"In this paper, we investigate the effect of inaccurate channel estimation on the bit error rate (BER) performance of the convolutionally coded MIMO-OFDM systems with multilevel quadrature amplitude modulation (M-QAM, M=16, 64) and different diversity orders, particularly in spatially correlated fading channels.

It is formulated as a highly nonlinear constrained multiobjective optimization problem with conflicting objectives. The inequality constraints considered are the generating unit capacity limits while the equality constraint is generation-demand balance with network losses included. A novel equality constraint handling mechanism is proposed in this paper. PSO algorithm is tested on a 30-bus standard test system. Results obtained show that PSO algorithm has a great potential in handling multiobjective optimization problems.

In this model, non-ideal conductive loss effects can also be easily taken into account in continuous and discontinuous inductor current modes.

In most applications of this method, it is assumed that inductor currents are in continuous mode and the discontinuous mode is largely neglected. In this paper, the derivation of low-order sampled-data models are summarized by an example. It is shown that the sampled-data models can also handle discontinuous inductor current and transitions between the continuous and discontinuous modes. Next, the use of the low order sampled-data models in reproducing the results obtained using the far more computationally intensive multi-frequency models in the literature is studied by examples. Specifically, using the sampled-data models, it is shown that the steady-state ripple for such converters in continuous inductor current mode and discontinuous inductor current mode can be easily computed. For converters with state feedback, the small-signal stability of the operating point, following the multi-frequency literature, is assessed using a Jacobian needed in the steady-state computations","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4054668/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2006","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"7-10 May 2006","htmlLink":"/document/4054668/","dateOfInsertion":"15 January 2007","publicationDate":"May 2006","accessionNumber":"9397747","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A Comparative Study of Multi-Frequency and Sampled-data Models for PWM DC-DC Converters","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Comparative Study of Multi-Frequency and Sampled-data Models for PWM DC-DC Converters","confLoc":"Ottawa, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"CCECE-00-151.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060503S","chronDate":"May  2006","xplore-pub-id":"4054516","isNumber":"4054517","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4054516","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4054517","articleId":"4054668","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4054673,"authors":[{"name":"Oktay Ureten","affiliation":["School of Information Technology and Engineering, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Oktay","lastName":"Ureten","id":"37267566900"},{"name":"Nur Serinken","affiliation":["Communications Research Centre, Terrestrial Wireless Systems Branch, Ottawa, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Nur","lastName":"Serinken","id":"37267565300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0038-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0840-7789"}],"articleNumber":"4054673","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":148},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4054673","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Hafnium","Iterative decoding","Turbo codes","Frequency estimation","Radio broadcasting","Parity check codes","Quadrature amplitude modulation","Fading","Bit error rate"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel coding","channel estimation","equalisers","error statistics","iterative decoding","OFDM modulation","radio receivers","turbo codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["iterative receiver","FEC decoder","channel estimation","HF channel","BER","bit error rate","turbo equalization","coded OFDM symbol","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["OFDM","turbo equalization","LDPC codes","HF modem"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4054517","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering","publicationTitle":"2006 Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering","doi":"10.1109/CCECE.2006.277672","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Turbo Equalization of Coded OFDM Symbols in Poor HF Channels","startPage":"1771","endPage":"1774","pdfPath":"/iel5/4054516/4054517/04054673.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CCECE.2006.277672","abstract":"In this paper, an iterative receiver that utilizes soft outputs of a FEC decoder to improve channel estimates iteratively is proposed.

This paper concentrates on the capacity study of such channels. Closed-form expressions for the instantaneous SNR and outage capacity distributions of a spatially correlated keyhole MIMO channel are given. The case of non-singular correlation matrices with distinct eigenvalues is considered in detail. When the numbers of Tx and Rx antennas are both large, the asymptotic outage capacity distribution of the keyhole channel is Gaussian under general conditions on the correlation (the average SNR affects the mean and the correlation affects the variance). The Gaussian approximation is accurate already for a reasonably small number of antennas (2times2). Based on the asymptotic capacity analysis, a full ordering scalar measure of MIMO channel correlation and power imbalance is introduced. Using this measure, we show analytically that the outage capacity at low outage probabilities decreases with correlation","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Correlated Keyhole MIMO Channels: SNR and Outage Capacity Distributions","publicationTitle":"2006 Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering","doi":"10.1109/CCECE.2006.277734","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/4054516/4054517/04054699.pdf","startPage":"908","endPage":"911","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CCECE.2006.277734","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4054517","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4054699","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4054699/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2006","displayDocTitle":"Correlated Keyhole MIMO Channels: SNR and Outage Capacity Distributions","conferenceDate":"7-10 May 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4054699/","dateOfInsertion":"15 January 2007","publicationDate":"May 2006","accessionNumber":"9397759","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Correlated Keyhole MIMO Channels: SNR and Outage Capacity Distributions","confLoc":"Ottawa, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"CCECE-00-182.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054978S","chronDate":"May  2006","xplore-pub-id":"4054516","isNumber":"4054517","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4054516","xplore-issue":"4054517","articleId":"4054699","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4054702,"authors":[{"name":"Yunfeng Peng","affiliation":["ASIC & System State Key Laboratory, Fudan University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Yunfeng","lastName":"Peng","id":"37834491100"},{"name":"Derui Kong","affiliation":["ASIC & System State Key Laboratory, Fudan University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Derui","lastName":"Kong","id":"37833551800"},{"name":"Feng Zhou","affiliation":["ASIC & System State Key Laboratory, Fudan University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Feng","lastName":"Zhou","id":"37277263400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0038-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0840-7789"}],"articleNumber":"4054702","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":315},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Switches","Sampling methods","Linearity","Threshold voltage","CMOS technology","MOS devices","Switching circuits","Signal resolution","Signal sampling","MOSFETs"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["analogue-digital conversion","switching circuits","transistors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["linear sampling switch","low-voltage operation","replica transistor","on-conductance","SFDR","analog-digital converter","high resolution ADC","0.35 micron"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Sampling switch","Nonlinearity","Low-Voltage"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4054702","doi":"10.1109/CCECE.2006.277737","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CCECE.2006.277737","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4054517","publicationTitle":"2006 Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/4054516/4054517/04054702.pdf","startPage":"1706","endPage":"1709","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Low-Voltage Sampling Switch with Improved Linearity","abstract":"A novel high linear sampling switch suitable for low-voltage operation is proposed.

This paper proposes a neural network parameter adaptation method for two immeasurable control parameters and to compensate the model uncertainty, so that the air-fuel ratio is regulated within the desired range. The adaptive law of the neural network is derived using the Lyapunov method, thus the stability of the whole system and the convergence of the networks are guaranteed. Since the model-plant mismatch caused by mechanical wear of parts and batch error in production are compensated and no initial values needed, the proposed technique has a strong potential to find industrial applications.

It involves the selection of a programmable, concurrent, heterogeneous multiprocessor architecture platform. Such a multiprocessor system on chip (MPSoC) platform has set new innovative trends for the real-time systems and system on chip (SoC) designers. The consequences of this trend imply the shift in concern from computation and sequential algorithms to modeling concurrency, synchronization and communication in every aspect of hardware and software co-design and development. These problems have been addressed by the use of packet switched network on chip (NOC) architecture for future SoCs and thus, real-time systems. Such a NOC based system should be able to support different levels of quality of service (QoS) to meet the real time systems requirements. Thus, it becomes extremely critical to properly design a network interface (NT) and the communication backbone for NOC. In this paper we present a component based design of network interface and communication backbone which supports different levels of QoS. The design has been tested for an adaptive wormhole routing with proactive turn prohibition to guarantee deadlock free on chip communication for NOC architecture. In this work we propose to use the modified turn prohibition (MTP), which has been shown to perform better than up/down and the turn prohibition","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/4054516/4054517/04054762.pdf","startPage":"1291","endPage":"1295","publicationTitle":"2006 Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering","doi":"10.1109/CCECE.2006.277852","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CCECE.2006.277852","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4054517","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4054762","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"QOS Driven Network-on-Chip Design for Real Time Systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Network-on-a-chip","Real time systems","Quality of service","Computer architecture","System-on-a-chip","Network interfaces","Spine","Embedded system","Multiprocessing systems","Software algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["embedded systems","integrated circuit design","multiprocessor interconnection networks","network interfaces","network routing","network-on-chip","quality of service"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["QOS driven network-on-chip design","real time embedded system","architectural design selection","multiprocessor architecture","multiprocessor system on chip","sequential algorithms","concurrency modeling","synchronization","hardware-software co-design","packet switched network on chip architecture","quality of service","network interface","communication backbone","adaptive wormhole routing","deadlock free","chip communication","modified turn prohibition"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Network-on-chip","network interface","quality-of-service","real-time-systems"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4054762/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2006","displayDocTitle":"QOS Driven Network-on-Chip Design for Real Time Systems","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4054762/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2006","accessionNumber":"9376534","dateOfInsertion":"15 January 2007","conferenceDate":"7-10 May 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"QOS Driven Network-on-Chip Design for Real Time Systems","confLoc":"Ottawa, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"CCECE-00-245.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060657S","chronDate":"May  2006","xplore-pub-id":"4054516","isNumber":"4054517","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4054516","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4054517","articleId":"4054762","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4054766,"authors":[{"name":"Ayda Basyouni","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Concordia University, Montreal, QUE, Canada"],"firstName":"Ayda","lastName":"Basyouni","id":"37293999800"},{"name":"Ahmed Elhakeem","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Concordia University, Montreal, QUE, Canada"],"firstName":"Ahmed","lastName":"Elhakeem","id":"37269433800"},{"name":"Anjali Agarwal","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Concordia University, Montreal, QUE, Canada"],"firstName":"Anjali","lastName":"Agarwal","id":"37273300400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0038-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0840-7789"}],"articleNumber":"4054766","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":25},"abstract":"cdma2000 1xEV-DV is considered to be the solution for the ever-growing demand of high-speed wireless packet data transmission.

The summing circuit is biased by the constant current sources to applicable different supply voltages. The buffer draws little current while static but has a large driving capability while transient. The circuit achieves the large driving capability by employing simple comparators to sense the transients of the input to turn on the output stages, which are statically off in the stable state. This increases the speed of the circuit without increasing static power consumption too much. An experimental prototype output buffer implemented in a 0.35-mum CMOS technology demonstrates that the circuit can operate under a wide power supply range. Quiescent currents of 5.4 muA and 7.4 muA are measured for power supplies of 3.3 V and 8 V, respectively.

A mesh-connected array structure is proposed based on Brent, Luk, and Van Loan's idea of an expandable square systolic array of simple 2x2 processors to compute the SVD of a large matrix, so as to shorten the iteration time and thus increase the implementation speed. The array consists of an n/2xn/2 array of 2x2 processor elements to compute the SVD of an nxn matrix. The trigonometric functions and the vector multiplication in the algorithm are tailored to the use of CORDIC (coordinate rotation digital computer) algorithms for hardware-efficient solutions. Two SVD processors, the basic SVD processor and the extended SVD processor, were developed. The algorithms to decompose the matrix were first evaluated in Matlab and then the processors were implemented using the Virtex-II FPGA from Xilinx as the target device. The basic SVD processor utilizes the proposed mesh-connected array structure and CORDIC algorithm. The implementation concentrates on utilizing the features of the FPGA to speed up operations and reduce the area required.

In this paper, we present an adaptive decentralized power control algorithm. Power control in the uplink direction is been considered. The proposed algorithm is a first order algorithm and utilizes bit error rate (BER) as a decision criterion for power update. Pilot bits in the uplink frame are used to measure the BER. We incorporate a nonlinear exponential term in the power update function to improve the speed of convergence of the algorithm which is also demonstrated through simulation results. Changing the adaptation parameter also changes the speed of convergence. The algorithm is examined in a time varying Rayleigh fading environment with frequency selective channel. We also demonstrate that the proposed algorithm achieves gain in the average required signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) value compared to other algorithms. The users are assumed to be mobile during the simulation period.

The goal of the paper is to introduce RBPF-based methods in an accessible manner via a main algorithm, which is detailed enough to be readily applied to a wide range of problems. To illustrate the practicality and the convenience of the approach, the algorithm is then tailored to two examples from different fields.

Test vector ordering is an effective method to reduce switching activity in combinational circuits and scan chain reordering has been often cited as an effective technique for reducing power dissipation in the scan chain during testing. This paper describes a technique for re-ordering of test vectors and scan cells to minimize power dissipation in full scan combinational circuits during test application. The reduction is achieved by decreasing the switching activity and spurious transitions between consequent test vectors and scan cells. We formulate the test vector and scan reordering problem as a travel salesman problem (TSP) using hamming distance between test vectors and scan cells. One of the successful approaches to solve TSP is using genetic algorithm (GA) and we use standard genetic algorithm to solve this problem.

Addition is the most complex operation in a floating-point unit and offers major delay while taking significant area. Over the years, the VLSI community has developed many floating-point adder algorithms mainly aimed to reduce the overall latency. An efficient design of floating-point adder onto an FPGA offers major area and performance overheads. With the recent advancement in FPGA architecture and area density, latency has been the main focus of attention in order to improve performance. Our research was oriented towards studying and implementing standard, LOP, and far and close data-path floating-point addition algorithms. Each algorithm has complex sub-operations which lead significantly to overall latency of the design. Each of the sub-operation is researched for different implementations and then synthesized onto a Xilinx Virtex2p FPGA device to be chosen for best performance. According to our results, standard algorithm is the best implementation with respect to area but has overall large latency of 27.059 ns while occupying 541 slices. LOP algorithm improves latency by 6.5% on added expense of 38% area compared to standard algorithm.

Typically, in the design phase preceding fabrication, an LNA needs to be designed/tuned for a given set of specifications (e.g. noise figure, power consumption, voltage gain etc.), which tend to be application-dependent. Traditional design based on simulation tools and trial-and-error is human-intensive and requires a high-degree of expertise from the circuit designer. As such, computer aided design (CAD) tools for LNA design are in great demand. This paper presents a new and systematic CAD approach for the design and tuning of LNAs in sub-micron CMOS technology. The approach has multiple phases. In the first phase, a detailed pre-analysis of the design specifications is carried out leading to knowledge-based ranking and selection of an appropriate LNA topology. In the design phase, concepts of single-stage design are exploited and the actual circuit is designed in a modular fashion leading to the initial design. Finally, as in any CAD approach, this design is put through a tuning phase so as to meet the given specifications. LNA design examples presented in the paper illustrate the proposed approach.

Secondly, kurtosis is employed as a criterion to retain the appropriate wavelet coefficients on a specific scale, and to zeroize all wavelet coefficients on other scales. Thirdly, the remaining wavelet coefficients are shrunken by a soft- threshold rule using universal threshold sigmaradic2log(n), the maximum standard deviation of wavelet coefficients on all scales before being zeroized, and n is the data length.

We formulate the straight line detection task as an energy minimization problem. This formulation helps the detection of lines in a global manner in contrast to the local detection methods used in conventional algorithms. As a result the proposed straight line detection algorithm can handle virtually co-located straight lines, slightly curved lines and edge linking in a unified manner. In addition, due to its the global nature, the algorithm is not deceived by image noise giving rise to spurious line segments. Therefore, the proposed algorithm can robustly detect straight lines. The main component of the algorithm is formulating the energy to be minimized. The contribution to this energy function is less at a pixel which is a good candidate to be a member of an existing line segment depending on the directional gradients. A pixel choosing a part of a line segment is costly, but not impossible. This energy optimization is done using dynamic programming snakes.

Based on this principle, a cascaded integrate comb (CIC) filter with factor-16 down sampler is used to realize large-factor and multiplier-free decimation in the front stage, while a multistage decimator is implemented together with the CIC filter to provide finer integral down sample rate. The multistage decimator is consisted of three stages, with each stage serving as a factor-2 down sampler. The Nyquist filters are used as anti-aliasing filter in the first two stages, and the linear phase equiripple filter is used in the last stage.

In order to compensate for the high parasitic capacitances in the CMOS process, this design uses a shunt and series inductive peaking technique to achieve the required transimpedance bandwidth.

Novel, high-Q series-stub transmission lines (SSTLs) are used in the matching networks of both LNAs. This SSTL structure shows a notable Q factor improvement over the commonly used spiral inductor, which helps to minimize the losses and noise produced in the LNA matching networks, making these topologies suitable for sensitive receiver front ends. The single-ended amplifier uses two cascade stages to help improve gain and reverse isolation when compared to common source stages. Results show that the cascade LNA is able to produce an excellent compromise between ease of design, gain and noise. After optimizing transistor sizes to produce minimum noise, the single-ended amplifier produces a simulated noise figure of only 4.9 dB and a gain of 17.4 dB. The differential LNA uses two capacitive neutralized stages to improve reverse isolation.

It is widely accepted as a solution to the quick introduction of variety of products with high quality and low costs into the new global market environment. The formation of an alliance is the most critical process in the whole lifecycle of the alliance. In this paper, a quantitative analysis method for the partner selection in an alliance is proposed by taking into considerations of the cost, due date and product quality.. Since the target function is non-analytical and can not be solved with a closed format, a fuzzy logic based decision making process for the project scheduling is presented. A fuzzy decision embedded genetic algorithm is developed to find the solution to the resource selection. This approach, successfully verified by a specifically designed experiment, is demonstrated to be a potential solution and optimization to the resource selection even for a large alliance.","doi":"10.1109/CCECE.2006.277756","startPage":"1731","endPage":"1734","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/4054516/4054517/04055017.pdf","publicationTitle":"2006 Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CCECE.2006.277756","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4054517","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Resources Selection of Dynamic Alliance Based on Genetic Algorithm","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Genetic algorithms","Costs","Contracts","Resource management","Technology management","Fuzzy logic","Mathematical model","Optimization methods","Globalization","Q factor"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decision making","fuzzy logic","genetic algorithms","operations research"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["resource selection","enterprise dynamic alliance","genetic algorithm","business opportunity","global market environment","quantitative analysis method","alliance partner selection","fuzzy logic based decision making process","project scheduling","fuzzy decision embedded genetic algorithm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Dynamic alliance","genetic algorithm","resource"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4055017/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2006","displayDocTitle":"Resources Selection of Dynamic Alliance Based on Genetic Algorithm","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4055017/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2006","dateOfInsertion":"15 January 2007","conferenceDate":"7-10 May 2006","accessionNumber":"9397938","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Resources Selection of Dynamic Alliance Based on Genetic Algorithm","confLoc":"Ottawa, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"CCECE-00-500.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042424S","chronDate":"May  2006","xplore-pub-id":"4054516","isNumber":"4054517","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4054516","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4054517","articleId":"4055017","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":4055025,"authors":[{"name":"Pavel Loskot","affiliation":["ICORE Wireless Communications Laboratory, Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB, Canada"],"firstName":"Pavel","lastName":"Loskot","id":"37268109000"},{"name":"Norman C.

Since it is very difficult to measure an antenna far-field impulse response, a numerical approach, i.e., the finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method, is used in this paper to calculate an antenna far field impulse response. It is well known that the FDTD method models electromagnetic problems in both spatial and temporal domains. In conjunction with the time domain near-to-far field transformation, the FDTD method can be used to compute an antenna far-field radiation waveform at any angular location. With the far-field waveform computed by the FDTD method, this paper presents the deconvolution procedure to obtain an antenna far-field impulse response. A 54-element waveguide slot array of X-band navigation radar is used as an example. Its far-field impulse response as a function of the radiation angle is computed using the FDTD method. The far-field waveforms of an FM pulse transmitted by the waveguide slot array are calculated using the convolution of the FM pulse and the array far-field impulse response. The instantaneous frequencies of these far-field waveforms at different radiation angles are examined in details. It clearly shows from analysis results that the instantaneous frequencies at the leading and trailing edges of the received pulse have been distorted. The amount of frequency shift is related to the antenna radiation pattern at different radiation angles","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Computation of Far-Field Impulse Response of an X-band Waveguide Slot Array using the Finite-Difference Time-Domain Method","publicationTitle":"2006 Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering","doi":"10.1109/CCECE.2006.277293","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/4054516/4054517/04055077.pdf","startPage":"9","endPage":"12","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CCECE.2006.277293","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4054517","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4055077","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4055077/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2006","displayDocTitle":"Computation of Far-Field Impulse Response of an X-band Waveguide Slot Array using the Finite-Difference Time-Domain Method","conferenceDate":"7-10 May 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4055077/","dateOfInsertion":"15 January 2007","publicationDate":"May 2006","accessionNumber":"9397998","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Computation of Far-Field Impulse Response of an X-band Waveguide Slot Array using the Finite-Difference Time-Domain Method","confLoc":"Ottawa, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"CCECE-00-560.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049197S","chronDate":"May  2006","xplore-pub-id":"4054516","isNumber":"4054517","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4054516","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4054517","articleId":"4055077","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4055183,"authors":[{"name":"S.

Dicke has described a method of detecting such signals. It employs a mechanical modulator at the input of a wide-band superheterodyne receiver. The detected output of the receiver is multiplied by a voltage of the same frequency as that which actuates the modulator, and filtered to produce a dc voltage when an external signal is present. Another method has been proposed which uses two independent receivers. The undetected output voltages are cross-correlated, and the correlator yields a dc voltage when a signal is applied to both receivers. Each method can be used to measure the intensity of signals small in amplitude compared to the noise of the receiver. A mathematical model of each of the circuits is presented, using, insofar as possible, the same assumptions; and equations derived for the least detectable signal power of each. The two-receiver method has, under the assumptions made, somewhat greater sensitivity. Engineering problems associated with each of the radiometers are discussed.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IRE","pdfPath":"/iel5/10933/4055293/04055310.pdf","startPage":"1663","endPage":"1666","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IRE","doi":"10.1109/JRPROC.1955.277994","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JRPROC.1955.277994","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4055293","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4055310","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Comparison of Two Radiometer Circuits","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Radiometry","Voltage","Circuit noise","Signal detection","Radiation detectors","Wideband","Frequency","Correlators","Noise measurement","Noise level"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4055310/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  1955","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov.  1955","displayDocTitle":"A Comparison of Two Radiometer Circuits","volume":"43","issue":"11","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 1955","dateOfInsertion":"15 January 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Comparison of Two Radiometer Circuits","sourcePdf":"JRPROC-v43-n11-17.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.032923S","chronDate":"Nov.  1955","isNumber":"4055293","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10933","citationCount":"26","articleId":"4055310","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1955","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4055358,"authors":[{"name":"G.

At several points in the story; short interludes are taken to fill in the status as of that time. Semiconductor research began quite inconspicuously about 120 years ago with some observations on the electrical properties of silver suphide. Progress was very slow for the next 50 years and then, about 1885, a mild interest developed with the discovery of point contact rectifiers. These devices were used as detectors until displaced by the vacuum tube around 1915. Development of selenium and cuprous oxide rectifiers about 1930 revived interest and the publication of a good theory of semiconductors in 1931 added still more momentum. The next period of active interest came around World War II when the catwhisker diode was revived and developed into an excellent radar detector. The announcement of the transistor in 1948 gave this field of research such a boost that it has become a real giant in the last few years and semiconductor electronics now rates as a major field of endeavor.","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4055359/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1955","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1955","volume":"43","issue":"12","dateOfInsertion":"15 January 2007","publicationDate":"Dec. 1955","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"History of Semiconductor Research","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"History of Semiconductor Research","promoFlag":"true","sourcePdf":"JRPROC-v43-n12-6.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.088075S","chronDate":"Dec.  1955","isNumber":"4055353","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10933","citationCount":"48","articleId":"4055359","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1955","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4055389,"authors":[{"name":"R.

The calculations were made assuming a loss-free circuit and a small coupling between the circuit and the beam. A method of computing the space-charge field, by summing the forces between the electrons, is fully described. It is found that in the large signal theory a parameter A is required in addition to the space-charge parameter QC. 1/k measures the range of action of the space-charge forces and is proportional to the beam radius. The other parameters including QC are those defined in the linear theory. Twenty cases covering useful ranges of the design and the operating parameters have been computed. The numerical integrations were done by type 701 IBM equipment. The amplitude and the phase of the circuit wave as functions of the distance are given for all the cases. It is found that the limiting efficiency increases with the electron injection speed, as found by Nordsieck, and increases with the space-charge parameter QC when QC is small, but decreases rapidly for larger QC. The efficiency also increases with the beam radius, or I/k, provided the assumption that the field and the current are uniformly distributed over the cross section is valid. Finally the electron motion in high level operation is analyzed. The effect of QC and of k on efficiency are explained.","doi":"10.1109/JRPROC.1955.278131","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IRE","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IRE","pdfPath":"/iel5/10933/4055400/04055404.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JRPROC.1955.278131","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4055400","startPage":"260","endPage":"277","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Large Signal Theory or Traveling-Wave Amplifiers","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4055404","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A Large Signal Theory or Traveling-Wave Amplifiers","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1955","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4055404/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1955","isJournal":true,"volume":"43","issue":"3","publicationDate":"March 1955","dateOfInsertion":"15 January 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Large Signal Theory or Traveling-Wave Amplifiers","sourcePdf":"JRPROC-v43-n3-4.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.052218S","chronDate":"March  1955","isNumber":"4055400","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10933","citationCount":"78","articleId":"4055404","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1955","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-28"},{"_id":4055450,"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0096-8390"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2162-6634"}],"articleNumber":"4055450","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":599},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4055450","abstract":"A selection of the journals which are regularly scanned for content of interest to our readers is given here, together with the addresses of publishers or editorial offices and the abbreviations of titles as used in the Abstracts and References.

The most important effects of internal feedback are reflected immittances and potential instability of amplifiers in certain frequency ranges. These phenomena are undesirable in many applications. Considering the various matrix representations of a two-terminal pair one can show that by connecting appropriate networks in a suitable manner to the active nonunilateral element, the internal feedback of the latter can be removed (neutralized). Several neutralized transistor arrangements have been investigated experimentally. The circuits are based on an analysis of the properties of transistor feedback parameters at \"higher\" frequencies. Neutralization throughout relatively wide bands of frequencies can be achieved using simple feedback arrangements. The maximum available power gain of transistor amplifiers is only moderately affected by neutralization.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Internal Feedback and Neutralization of Transistor Amplifiers","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IRE","doi":"10.1109/JRPROC.1955.278150","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IRE","pdfPath":"/iel5/10933/4055496/04055509.pdf","startPage":"838","endPage":"847","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JRPROC.1955.278150","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4055496","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4055509","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4055509/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"July  1955","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  1955","displayDocTitle":"Internal Feedback and Neutralization of Transistor Amplifiers","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"43","issue":"7","dateOfInsertion":"15 January 2007","publicationDate":"July 1955","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Internal Feedback and Neutralization of Transistor Amplifiers","sourcePdf":"JRPROC-v43-n7-13.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.043535S","chronDate":"July  1955","isNumber":"4055496","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10933","citationCount":"14","articleId":"4055509","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1955","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4055513,"authors":[{"name":"M.

The circuit was operated with S-band oscillators (707B klystron; 2C37 triode oscillator) and a 2K50 K-band klystron. It is possible to lock a microwave oscillator directly or through a cascade of such circuits to a quartz-stabilized oscillator. The statistical theory of random noise is used to obtain an analysis of the stabilizing effect of the circuit, and the power spectrum of the stabilized microwave source is calculated. The scheme can also be applied in divider operation. Modifications are discussed. A modified circuit that uses carrier-suppressed modulation of the reference signal has also been realized. In another circuit, the oscillator frequency is converted by means of a stable reference, and compared with a second reference that can be of low frequency and tunable. These latter circuits allow elimination of the excess noise introduced by crystal diodes. In the original straight dc circuit this noise cannot be eliminated, but calculation shows that its influence on the output power spectrum is very small.","doi":"10.1109/JRPROC.1955.278154","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IRE","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IRE","pdfPath":"/iel5/10933/4055496/04055513.pdf","startPage":"869","endPage":"873","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JRPROC.1955.278154","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4055496","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Phase Stabilization of Microwave Oscillators","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4055513","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"July  1955","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  1955","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4055513/","displayDocTitle":"Phase Stabilization of Microwave Oscillators","volume":"43","issue":"7","publicationDate":"July 1955","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"15 January 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Phase Stabilization of Microwave Oscillators","sourcePdf":"JRPROC-v43-n7-17.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.05762S","chronDate":"July  1955","isNumber":"4055496","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10933","citationCount":"26","articleId":"4055513","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1955","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4055524,"authors":[{"name":"M.

It is shown that the minimum noise figure of any amplifier of this type with lossless RF structures is identical with that already found by several authors for the traveling-wave tube and is entirely determined by the noise parameters of the beam.

A general method for deriving a unilateral circuit based on an equivalent circuit of the device is described, emphasis being placed on junction transistors operating at high frequencies. The principle is: application of external feedback which neutralizes the internal feedback of the device so that the signals at the output end no longer yield a signal at the input end. In general, two types of circuits are used for junction-transistor high-frequency amplifiers: emitter input and base input connections. Measurements of the input characteristics of two singly-tuned amplifiers have verified their unilateral properties. Tolerances of the neutralizing network depend on such factors as: transistor parameter spread, impedance level of the collector circuit, and performance deviations which a designer will accept. Gain and input and output characteristics of the unilateralized high-frequency amplifier may be predicted easily from the transistor parameters (both emitter input and base input connection) in a frequency range below the alpha cutoff frequency.","doi":"10.1109/JRPROC.1955.278209","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JRPROC.1955.278209","startPage":"1001","endPage":"1006","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IRE","pdfPath":"/iel5/10933/4055520/04055535.pdf","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IRE","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4055520","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Unilateralization of Junction-Transistor Amplifiers at High Frequencies","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug.  1955","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  1955","displayDocTitle":"Unilateralization of Junction-Transistor Amplifiers at High Frequencies","publicationDate":"Aug. 1955","dateOfInsertion":"15 January 2007","volume":"43","issue":"8","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4055535/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Unilateralization of Junction-Transistor Amplifiers at High Frequencies","sourcePdf":"JRPROC-v43-n8-15.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.017543S","chronDate":"Aug.  1955","isNumber":"4055520","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10933","citationCount":"12","articleId":"4055535","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1955","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4055552,"authors":[{"name":"D.

The gain decreases with decreasing 1e or Vc. Using the series-parallel representation, the parameter most sensitive to Ie-variations is h11, whereas Vc-variations affect h12 and h22 considerably. In common emitter configuration changes of h21 are also important. A study of the dependance of the hii on the dc operating point explains the nature of gain variations with Ie and Vc. Satisfactory AGC circuits have been built using either Ie- or Vc-control. The control power required is very small if Ie or Vc are controlled indirectly by varying the base current. Since Ie or Vc are decreased considerably in the presence of strong input signals, the problem of distortion must be given serious consideration. Due to the variation of transistor driving point impedances, AGC may result in changes of the bandpass characteristic of tuned amplifiers. The gain of transistor converters and oscillator-converters can be controlled by conventional or special techniques.","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4055556/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  1955","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  1955","dateOfInsertion":"15 January 2007","publicationDate":"Sept. 1955","volume":"43","issue":"9","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Automatic Gain Control of Transistor Amplifiers","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Automatic Gain Control of Transistor Amplifiers","sourcePdf":"JRPROC-v43-n9-14.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.037956S","chronDate":"Sept.  1955","isNumber":"4055542","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10933","citationCount":"7","articleId":"4055556","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1955","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4056012,"authors":[{"name":"Steven feiner","affiliation":["Brown University of Providence, USA"],"firstName":"Steven","lastName":"feiner","id":"38224072400"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0272-1716"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-1756"}],"articleNumber":"4056012","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":50,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":127},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computer Society","url":"http://www.computer.org"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4056012","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Computer graphics","Rendering (computer graphics)","Expert systems","Computer science","Motion pictures","Computational modeling","Collaborative work","Algorithm design and analysis"]}],"doi":"10.1109/MCG.1985.276329","endPage":"37","startPage":"29","publicationTitle":"IEEE Computer Graphics and Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Computer Graphics and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/38/4055999/04056012.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MCG.1985.276329","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4055999","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Apex: An Experiment in the Automated Creation of Pictorial Explanations","abstract":"How might we automate the design of pictures that are intended to show the viewer how to perform a series of tasks?","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov.  1985","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  1985","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4056012/","volume":"5","issue":"11","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 1985","dateOfInsertion":"15 January 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Apex: An Experiment in the Automated Creation of Pictorial Explanations","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Apex: An Experiment in the Automated Creation of Pictorial Explanations","sourcePdf":"MCG-v5-n11-13.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.043038S","chronDate":"Nov.  1985","isNumber":"4055999","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"38","citationCount":"50","articleId":"4056012","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1985","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4056067,"authors":[{"name":"Medhat Karima","affiliation":["Atomic Energy of Canada Limited, Canada"],"firstName":"Medhat","lastName":"Karima","id":"37831835700"},{"name":"Kuldip S.

It is shown that the scattering elements are illuminated by a combination of direct and indirect fields, the latter being \"reflected\" by surface elements closer to the radar. At small depression angles these interfere destructively, giving rise to the so-called \"critical angle,\" polarization dependence, \"spikiness,\" and steeper frequency dependence. A theory is developed in which the elemental scatterers are taken to be the small patches, or \"facets,\" of the surface. It is found that the facets which back scatter most effectively at small depression angles are those whose dimensions are of the order of the wavelength, and that the frequency dependence of the scattering parameter o\u00b0 at small depression angles is determined by the size distribution of the facets. If the size and slope distributions of the facets are independent of each other, then, below a high-frequency limit, o\u00b0 has essentially the same frequency dependence at low angles and high angles. The high-angle variation of o\u00b0 with angle is determined mainly by the slope distribution of the facets. With the slope distribution determined from optical measurements by Cox and Munk, o\u00b0 is approximately proportional to wind speed at small depression angles, but inversely proportional to wind speed at vertical incidence. Using measured values of o\u00b0, the facet mechanism accounts for scattering by the entire surface of the sea.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JRPROC.1957.278255","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4056355","startPage":"44","endPage":"54","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IRE","pdfPath":"/iel5/10933/4056355/04056373.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the Mechanisms of Radar Sea Clutter","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4056373/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  1957","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  1957","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"On the Mechanisms of Radar Sea Clutter","publicationDate":"Jan. 1957","dateOfInsertion":"15 January 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"45","issue":"1","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the Mechanisms of Radar Sea Clutter","sourcePdf":"JRPROC-v45-n1-18.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.038179S","chronDate":"Jan.  1957","isNumber":"4056355","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10933","citationCount":"43","articleId":"4056373","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1957","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4056378,"authors":[{"name":"William H.

A large class of important signal generators may be represented by a \"trigger generator\" which delivers a sequence of one or more impulses to various waveform generators. By describing the \"trigger generator\" by a Markoff process, by identifying the transition probability-densities between states of the Markoff process with impulse responses, and by interpreting the final response as an expectation-density (or average over the ensemble of possible signals), it is possible to obtain, by methods which are very similar to those used in computing the transfer function of an ordinary circuit, expressions for the power spectrum and correlation functions of signals produced by such sources. The important relationships between stochastic processes and familiar circuit concepts are first illustrated by calculating the probabilities associated with four different coin-tossing experiments of increasing complexity. As a fifth example, these relations are used to develop the well-known Poisson distribution and to introduce the expectation-density of occurrence of a recurrent event. General formulas for the correlation functions and power spectra of signals produced by Markoffian sources are then obtained for: a random telegraph message; a series of identical pulses having time jitter, both for the free-running and clock-synchronized cases; and, finally, a series of identical pulses of alternating polarity but with random spacing.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JRPROC.1957.278301","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4056355","startPage":"74","endPage":"86","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IRE","pdfPath":"/iel5/10933/4056355/04056378.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Signal-Flow Graphs and Random Signals","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4056378/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  1957","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  1957","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Signal-Flow Graphs and Random Signals","publicationDate":"Jan. 1957","dateOfInsertion":"15 January 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"45","issue":"1","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Signal-Flow Graphs and Random Signals","sourcePdf":"JRPROC-v45-n1-23.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.03037S","chronDate":"Jan.  1957","isNumber":"4056355","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10933","citationCount":"57","articleId":"4056378","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1957","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4056397,"authors":[{"name":"John J.

It is shown that the injection deficit of an emitter can be decreased by several orders of magnitude if the emitter has a higher band gap than the base region. This effect can be utilized either in addition to the commonly used high emitter doping in order to eliminate the alpha falloff with current, or to decrease the high emitter doping in order to obtain a lower emitter capacitance.

It is shown that a practical balun of this type, designed to match a 50-ohm unbalanced line to a balanced 70-ohm antenna, has a voltage standing-wave ratio of 1.4 or better over a frequency band of about 2.8 to 1. The wide bandwidth, simplicity, and reasonable physical dimensions make the balun particularly useful in connection with the adjustable-length dipole antennas which are generally used for vhf and uhf fieldstrength measurement.","doi":"10.1109/JRPROC.1957.278293","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4056439","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JRPROC.1957.278293","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IRE","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IRE","pdfPath":"/iel5/10933/4056439/04056450.pdf","startPage":"1628","endPage":"1631","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A New Wide-Band Balun","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1957","displayDocTitle":"A New Wide-Band Balun","volume":"45","issue":"12","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1957","dateOfInsertion":"15 January 2007","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 1957","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4056450/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A New Wide-Band Balun","sourcePdf":"JRPROC-v45-n12-11.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.040541S","chronDate":"Dec.  1957","isNumber":"4056439","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10933","citationCount":"121","articleId":"4056450","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1957","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4056481,"authors":[{"name":"R.

The method relies on the fact that the coupling elements can be made into perfect impedance inverters, or \"quarter-wave\" transformers, by the addition of negative elements in lumped-constant circuits, or of short negative lengths of line in waveguide and transmission-line circuits. Specific design formulas are given for filters constructed of lumped-constant elements, waveguide, and strip or other TEM transmission line, and for pass band response functions of the maximally flat and Tchebycheff types. The formulas include a simple frequency transformation that corrects for the frequency sensitivity of the coupling reactances, and thereby greatly improves the design accuracy for both lumpedconstant and microwave types when the bandwidth is more than a few per cent. Exact response curves computed from typical filter designs are compared to the prototype-function response curves, and it is shown that the design formulas give good results with bandwidths of at least 20 per cent in guide wavelength in the case of waveguide filters, or 20 per cent in frequency for TEM-mode transmission-line and lumped-constant filters.","doi":"10.1109/JRPROC.1957.278389","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IRE","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IRE","pdfPath":"/iel5/10933/4056472/04056485.pdf","startPage":"187","endPage":"196","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4056472","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JRPROC.1957.278389","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Direct-Coupled-Resonator Filters","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4056485","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  1957","displayDocTitle":"Direct-Coupled-Resonator Filters","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4056485/","publicationDate":"Feb. 1957","dateOfInsertion":"15 January 2007","isJournal":true,"volume":"45","issue":"2","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb.  1957","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Direct-Coupled-Resonator Filters","sourcePdf":"JRPROC-v45-n2-13.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.038062S","chronDate":"Feb.  1957","isNumber":"4056472","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10933","citationCount":"355","articleId":"4056485","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1957","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4056510,"authors":[{"name":"Arthur P.

At such frequencies, the maximum power gain is infinite and the transistor may oscillate. This paper discusses the maximum power gain realizable as a function of a required degree of stability. A \"stability factor\" is defined in terms of the transistor parameters and terminations (the admittance matrix is used as an example, but the approach is analogous using other representations). The maximum stable power gain of an isolated amplifier stage and the terminating admittances required for the realization of this maximum power gain are then computed as functions of the stability factor. The computations are extended to include bandwidth requirements and limitations. (It is found that, although bandwidth requirements may impose limitations on the power gain, there is no simple relationship tying together bandwidth and power gain.) The treatment of multistage amplifiers is outlined with the conclusion that the gain realizable in an n-stage amplifier is smaller than n times the gain of a one-stage amplifier having the same stability factor as the stages of the n-stage amplifier. The respective advantages of different representations for different circuit configurations are discussed. In an appendix, the theoretical considerations are applied to tuned transistor amplifiers in common-emitter and common-base configurations. The stability factor is related to the tolerances in transistor parameters and terminating impedances. Examples are given for the maximum realizable stable gain as function of parameter tolerances.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IRE","pdfPath":"/iel5/10933/4056498/04056510.pdf","startPage":"335","endPage":"343","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IRE","doi":"10.1109/JRPROC.1957.278369","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JRPROC.1957.278369","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4056498","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4056510","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Stability and Power Gain of Tuned Transistor Amplifiers","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power amplifiers","Frequency","Feedback","Bandwidth","Gain measurement","Circuit stability","Electron tubes","Transistors","Power measurement","Electrical resistance measurement"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4056510/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1957","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1957","displayDocTitle":"Stability and Power Gain of Tuned Transistor Amplifiers","volume":"45","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 1957","dateOfInsertion":"15 January 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Stability and Power Gain of Tuned Transistor Amplifiers","sourcePdf":"JRPROC-v45-n3-12.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.029215S","chronDate":"March  1957","isNumber":"4056498","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10933","citationCount":"51","articleId":"4056510","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1957","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4056565,"authors":[{"name":"F.

The significant parameter considered is the ratio of mean signal power to mean interference power needed at the receiver for satisfactory performance. When satisfactory performance is required a high percentage of the time the signal power must be greatly increased over the nonfading case, e.g., 99.9 per cent satisfactory operation requires 30 db more signal power in the presence of signal fading whether or not the interference is fading. The improvement which dual diversity reception offers is discussed for each case. For 99.9 per cent satisfactory operation a practical dual diversity system offers a 14 db improvement over nondiversity for fading signal and fading interference.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IRE","pdfPath":"/iel5/10933/4056558/04056565.pdf","startPage":"636","endPage":"642","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IRE","doi":"10.1109/JRPROC.1957.278412","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JRPROC.1957.278412","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4056558","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4056565","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The Effect of Fading on Communication Circuits Subject to Interference","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fading","Circuits","Interference","Rayleigh channels","Radio communication","Signal analysis","Performance analysis","Receivers","Diversity reception","Diversity methods"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4056565/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  1957","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May  1957","displayDocTitle":"The Effect of Fading on Communication Circuits Subject to Interference","volume":"45","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May 1957","dateOfInsertion":"15 January 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Effect of Fading on Communication Circuits Subject to Interference","sourcePdf":"JRPROC-v45-n5-7.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.044662S","chronDate":"May  1957","isNumber":"4056558","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10933","citationCount":"17","articleId":"4056565","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1957","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4056568,"authors":[{"name":"M.

Double-null reception, which splits the null zone and thereby retains polarity information, offers only a slight additional increase in rate. It affords a significant advantage over single-null reception, though, because it is much less sensitive to variations in null level.","doi":"10.1109/JRPROC.1957.278507","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IRE","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IRE","pdfPath":"/iel5/10933/4056624/04056635.pdf","startPage":"963","endPage":"975","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4056624","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JRPROC.1957.278507","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improvement of Binary Transmission by Null-Zone Reception","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4056635","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  1957","displayDocTitle":"Improvement of Binary Transmission by Null-Zone Reception","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4056635/","publicationDate":"July 1957","dateOfInsertion":"15 January 2007","isJournal":true,"volume":"45","issue":"7","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"July  1957","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improvement of Binary Transmission by Null-Zone Reception","sourcePdf":"JRPROC-v45-n7-11.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.034485S","chronDate":"July  1957","isNumber":"4056624","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10933","citationCount":"24","articleId":"4056635","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1957","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4056638,"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0096-8390"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2162-6634"}],"articleNumber":"4056638","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":24,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":168},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4056638","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Electron tubes","Microwave theory and techniques","Electronic equipment testing","Glass","Microwave measurements","Personnel","TV","Photoelectricity","Cameras","Microwave oscillators"]}],"doi":"10.1109/JRPROC.1957.278510","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IRE","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IRE","pdfPath":"/iel5/10933/4056624/04056638.pdf","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/04056638.png","startPage":"983","endPage":"1010","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JRPROC.1957.278510","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4056624","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"IRE Standards on Electron Tubes: Definitions of Terms, 1957","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  1957","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4056638/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"July  1957","volume":"45","issue":"7","publicationDate":"July 1957","dateOfInsertion":"15 January 2007","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"IRE Standards on Electron Tubes: Definitions of Terms, 1957","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"IRE Standards on Electron Tubes: Definitions of Terms, 1957","sourcePdf":"JRPROC-v45-n7-14.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.017389S","chronDate":"July  1957","isNumber":"4056624","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10933","citationCount":"24","articleId":"4056638","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1957","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4056679,"authors":[{"name":"Chih-tang Sah","affiliation":["Shockley Semiconductor Laboratory, Mountain View, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Chih-tang","lastName":"Sah","id":"37067145000"},{"name":"Robert N.

It is the purpose of this paper to show that the current due to generation and recombination of carriers from generation-recombination centers in the space charge region of a p-n junction accounts for the observed characteristics. This phenomenon dominates in semiconductors with large energy gap, low lifetimes, and low resistivity. This model not only accounts for the nonsaturable reverse current, but also predicts an apparent exp (qV/nkT) dependence of the forward current in a p-n junction. The relative importance of the diffusion current outside the space charge layer and the recombination current inside the space charge layer also explains the increase of the emitter efficiency of silicon transistors with emitter current. A correlation of the theory with experiment indicates that the energy level of the centers is a few kT from the intrinsic Fermi level.","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4056679/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  1957","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  1957","volume":"45","issue":"9","dateOfInsertion":"15 January 2007","publicationDate":"Sept. 1957","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Carrier Generation and Recombination in P-N Junctions and P-N Junction Characteristics","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Carrier Generation and Recombination in P-N Junctions and P-N Junction Characteristics","sourcePdf":"JRPROC-v45-n9-9.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.036889S","chronDate":"Sept.  1957","isNumber":"4056670","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10933","citationCount":"1572","articleId":"4056679","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1957","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":4056681,"authors":[{"name":"Otto J.

Complete transient response times of the order of a fraction of the natural oscillatory period can be obtained. Excellent waveshape reproduction is achieved through a linear phase lag with frequency. The method consists of exciting several transient oscillations, at closely spaced times, with magnitudes and phases so adjusted that the resultant sum of the transient oscillation phasors is zero. The steady-state output is the arithmetic sum of the excitation magnitudes. When a step input transient is divided into two spaced excitations, one-half cycle response is obtainable. When the input transient is divided into three excitations, one-fourth period or faster transient times are realizable, depending upon the available dynamic range or signal-to-noise ratio. The principle of design is to adjust a system to the maximum possible resonant frequency, independent of the damping factor, but stable, and then to apply the Posicast control to completely remove the oscillatory component in the output. In an electrical feedback control system, the additional hardware consists of one or two artificial transmission lines.","doi":"10.1109/JRPROC.1957.278530","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IRE","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IRE","pdfPath":"/iel5/10933/4056670/04056681.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JRPROC.1957.278530","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4056670","startPage":"1249","endPage":"1255","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Posicast Control of Damped Oscillatory Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4056681","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Posicast Control of Damped Oscillatory Systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  1957","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4056681/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  1957","isJournal":true,"volume":"45","issue":"9","publicationDate":"Sept. 1957","dateOfInsertion":"15 January 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Posicast Control of Damped Oscillatory Systems","sourcePdf":"JRPROC-v45-n9-11.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.071295S","chronDate":"Sept.  1957","isNumber":"4056670","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10933","citationCount":"371","articleId":"4056681","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1957","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4056707,"authors":[{"name":"Karl Guttag","affiliation":["Texas Instruments, Inc., USA"],"firstName":"Karl","lastName":"Guttag","id":"37828448000"},{"name":"Jerry Van Aken","affiliation":["Texas Instruments"],"firstName":"Jerry Van","lastName":"Aken"},{"name":"Michael Asal","affiliation":["Texas Instruments, Inc., USA"],"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Asal","id":"37831486500"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0272-1716"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-1756"}],"articleNumber":"4056707","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":12,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":83},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computer Society","url":"http://www.computer.org"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4056707","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Very large scale integration","Graphics","Hardware","Application software","Random access memory","Displays","Read-write memory","Software performance","Instruments","Buffer storage"]}],"abstract":"This article will discuss issues that must be considered in the design of a VLSI (very large scale integration) 32-bit microprocessor specialized for graphics applications.

Processing time is found to be virtually independent of the number of objects involved in the scene. For large numbers of objects, this method actully becomes faster than scan-line methods. To remove jags from edges, a scheme for identifying edge orientation and distance from pixel center to true edge has been implemented. The time required for antialiasing depends on the total length of the edges encountered, but it is normally only a fractional addition to the time needed to produce the scene without antialiasing.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Computer Graphics and Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Computer Graphics and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/38/4056851/04056861.pdf","startPage":"16","endPage":"26","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MCG.1986.276715","doi":"10.1109/MCG.1986.276715","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4056851","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"ARTS: Accelerated Ray-Tracing System","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"April  1986","displayDocTitle":"ARTS: Accelerated Ray-Tracing System","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4056861/","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"15 January 2007","publicationDate":"April 1986","volume":"6","issue":"4","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  1986","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"ARTS: Accelerated Ray-Tracing System","sourcePdf":"MCG-v6-n4-10.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.04903S","chronDate":"April  1986","isNumber":"4056851","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"38","citationCount":"253","articleId":"4056861","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1986","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4056863,"authors":[{"name":"Geoff Wyvill","affiliation":["University of Otago, New Zealand"],"firstName":"Geoff","lastName":"Wyvill","id":"37271612900"},{"name":"Tosiyasu L.

Definitions of such objects are represented by tree structures or directed acyclic graphs. Most existing systems convert this representation to a more conventional boundary representation of the solids in order to render pictures from the model. More recently, a number of systems have been described that render the pictures directly from the CSG structure. We describe such a system. We render a scene by ray tracing from a directed acyclic graph. This process is made efficient for large models by using an adaptive method of space division to reduce the number of intersection calculations needed.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Computer Graphics and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/38/4056851/04056863.pdf","startPage":"28","endPage":"34","publicationTitle":"IEEE Computer Graphics and Applications","doi":"10.1109/MCG.1986.276717","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MCG.1986.276717","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4056851","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4056863","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Space Division for Ray Tracing in CSG","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Ray tracing","Engine cylinders","Tree data structures","Shape","Geometry","Design engineering","Welding","Solid modeling","Layout","Data structures"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4056863/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  1986","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"April  1986","displayDocTitle":"Space Division for Ray Tracing in CSG","volume":"6","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"April 1986","dateOfInsertion":"15 January 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Space Division for Ray Tracing in CSG","sourcePdf":"MCG-v6-n4-12.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.030964S","chronDate":"April  1986","isNumber":"4056851","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"38","citationCount":"37","articleId":"4056863","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1986","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":4056914,"authors":[{"name":"Thomas W.

A particularly powerful technique for simulating light reflection-an important element in creating this realism-is called ray tracing. This method produces images of excellent quality, but suffers from lengthy computation time that limits its practical use. This article presents a new method to reduce shadow testing time during ray tracing. The technique involves generating light buffers, each of which partition the environment with respect to an individual light source. These partition descriptions are then used during shadow testing to quickly determine a small subset of objects that may have to be tested for intersection. The results of timing tests illustrate the beneficial performance of these techniques. The tests compare the standard ray-tracing algorithm to light buffers of varying resolution.","doi":"10.1109/MCG.1986.276832","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Computer Graphics and Applications","startPage":"6","endPage":"16","publicationTitle":"IEEE Computer Graphics and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/38/4056977/04056983.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MCG.1986.276832","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4056977","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The Light Buffer: A Shadow-Testing Accelerator","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Acceleration","Ray tracing","Testing","Light sources","Life estimation","Layout","Lighting","Material properties","Pixel","Encoding"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  1986","displayDocTitle":"The Light Buffer: A Shadow-Testing Accelerator","volume":"6","issue":"9","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"15 January 2007","publicationDate":"Sept. 1986","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  1986","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4056983/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Light Buffer: A Shadow-Testing Accelerator","sourcePdf":"MCG-v6-n9-6.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.054622S","chronDate":"Sept.  1986","isNumber":"4056977","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"38","citationCount":"67","articleId":"4056983","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1986","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4057052,"authors":[{"name":"Eric Hoines","affiliation":["3D/Eye Inc."],"firstName":"Eric","lastName":"Hoines"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0272-1716"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-1756"}],"articleNumber":"4057052","dbTime":"16 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":56,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":42},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computer Society","url":"http://www.computer.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Proposals","Computer graphics","Spatial databases","Ray tracing","Rendering (computer graphics)","Tree graphs","Computer displays"]}],"doi":"10.1109/MCG.1987.277062","publicationTitle":"IEEE Computer Graphics and Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Computer Graphics and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/38/4057048/04057052.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MCG.1987.277062","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4057048","startPage":"3","endPage":"5","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Proposal for Standard Graphics Environments","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4057052","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A Proposal for Standard Graphics Environments","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  1987","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4057052/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov.  1987","isJournal":true,"volume":"7","issue":"11","publicationDate":"Nov. 1987","dateOfInsertion":"15 January 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Proposal for Standard Graphics Environments","sourcePdf":"MCG-v7-n11-4.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.039387S","chronDate":"Nov.  1987","isNumber":"4057048","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"38","citationCount":"56","articleId":"4057052","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1987","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4057127,"authors":[{"name":"Gary A.

The purpose of the chip is to calculate the intersection point of a ray with the bicubic patch to a specified level of accuracy, returning parameter values (u,v) specifying the location of the intersection on the patch, and a parameter value, t, which specifies the location of the intersection on the ray. The intersection is calculated by succesively subdividing the patch and computing the intersection of the ray with a bounding box of each subpatch until the bounding volume meets theaccuracy requirement. There are two operating modes: another in which all intersections are found. This algorithm (and the chip) correctly handle the difficult cases of the ray tangentially intersecting a planar patch and intersections of the ray at a silhouette edge of the patch. Estimates indicate that such a chip could be implemented in 2-micron NMOS (N-type metal oxide semiconductor) and could computer patch-ray intersections at the rate of one every 15 microseconds for patces that are prescaled and specified to a 12-bit fixed point for each of the x, y, and z components. A version capable of handling 24-bit patches could compute patch/ray intersections at the rate of one every 140 section point could be performed with the addition of nine scalar subtractions and six scalar multiplies. Images drawn using a software version of the algorithm are presented and discussed.","doi":"10.1109/MCG.1987.276963","publicationTitle":"IEEE Computer Graphics and Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Computer Graphics and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/38/4057118/04057129.pdf","startPage":"33","endPage":"44","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MCG.1987.276963","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4057118","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The Feasibility of a VLSI Chip for Ray Tracing Bicublic Patches","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4057129","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1987","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1987","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4057129/","displayDocTitle":"The Feasibility of a VLSI Chip for Ray Tracing Bicublic Patches","volume":"7","issue":"3","publicationDate":"March 1987","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"15 January 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Feasibility of a VLSI Chip for Ray Tracing Bicublic Patches","sourcePdf":"MCG-v7-n3-11.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.055411S","chronDate":"March  1987","isNumber":"4057118","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"38","citationCount":"19","articleId":"4057129","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1987","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4057175,"authors":[{"name":"Jeffrey Goldsmith","affiliation":["Jet Propulsion Laboratory, USA"],"firstName":"Jeffrey","lastName":"Goldsmith","id":"37836831500"},{"name":"John Salmon","affiliation":["California Institute of Technology, USA"],"firstName":"John","lastName":"Salmon","id":"37361176200"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0272-1716"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-1756"}],"articleNumber":"4057175","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":189,"citationCountPatent":26,"totalDownloads":780},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computer Society","url":"http://www.computer.org"}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Automatic Creation of Object Hierarchies for Ray Tracing","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Ray tracing","Rendering (computer graphics)","Computational modeling","Optical refraction","Image databases","Visual databases"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4057175","abstract":"Intersection calculations dominate the run time of canonical ray tracers.

Radio base station antennas with fast beam steering in elevation and/or azimuth can significantly improve the carrier to interference ratio and hence the spectral efficiency. The carrier to interference ratio improvement of using fast beam steering in elevation is estimated using a two cell model.

This modification provides fine frequency tuning capabilities using a very small sine/cosine look-up-table. Current systems use hundreds or thousands carriers requiring a DDS with very small frequency steps. This requires enormous amounts of memory for the sine/cosine LUT and an accumulator with many bits, limiting the maximum clock frequency. A reduction of required memory of more than 3 orders of magnitude can be achieved while an smaller phase accumulator allows for higher frequency operation. The design can deal also with systems where selectable carrier spacing is used such as DAB (digital audio broadcasting), with a minimal memory resource count increase.

Therefore, to evaluate the adaptive beamforming capability of the ESPAR antenna, the genetic algorithm (GA) is applied and the results are compared with those obtained by applying the steepest-gradient algorithm (SGA) to the ESPAR antenna. The GA results reveal that the ESPAR antenna possesses the ability to form a beam and null at the same time, even when the angular difference between the desired and interference signal is less than 60 degrees","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4057437/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-12 Sept. 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2006","dateOfInsertion":"15 January 2007","accessionNumber":"9439623","htmlLink":"/document/4057437/","conferenceDate":"10-12 Sept. 2006","displayDocTitle":"Evaluation of the Adaptive Beamforming Capability of an ESPAR Antenna Using the Genetic Algorithm","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Evaluation of the Adaptive Beamforming Capability of an ESPAR Antenna Using the Genetic Algorithm","confLoc":"Manchester, UK","sourcePdf":"ECWT-00-43.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055869S","chronDate":"10-12 Sept. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4057393","isNumber":"4057394","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4057393","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4057394","articleId":"4057437","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EUROPEAN MICROWAVE ASSOCIATION","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4057438,"authors":[{"name":"Jiayi Wu","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Queen''s Mary, University of London, London, UK"],"firstName":"Jiayi","lastName":"Wu","id":"37537246600"},{"name":"John Bigham","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Queen''s Mary, University of London, London, UK"],"firstName":"John","lastName":"Bigham","id":"37274645600"},{"name":"Peng Jiang","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Queen''s Mary, University of London, London, UK"],"firstName":"Peng","lastName":"Jiang","id":"37538019300"},{"name":"John Peter Neophytou","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Queen''s Mary, University of London, London, UK"],"firstName":"John Peter","lastName":"Neophytou","id":"37841091500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"2-9600551-5-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4057438","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":182},"abstract":"This paper summarizes recent developments in semi-smart antenna systems for geographic load balancing in cellular mobile communication systems by cooperatively changing the antenna radiation patterns and compares the performance with cooperatively down tilted antennas. Cooperative coverage is advantageous, e.g. in the presence of hotspots. For semi-smart antennas the ideal shape for a cell in the context of its neighbours is determined using the bubble oscillation algorithm (BOA) and the pattern is then given to the semi-smart antenna for further radiation pattern synthesis. The adjustment process differs for different antenna systems and mostly depends on the antenna's physical capabilities on pattern shaping. This paper then considers the special case of adaptively tilting through the use of electrical down-tilt (EDT) antennas, and compares the system capacity performance between EDT and semi-smart antennas for traffic load balancing. Coverage under load balancing is optimal with respect to the whole network, rather than just for individual antennas. The results show that both the adaptive approaches give benefit, with different site costs in relation to practical antenna system complexity","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 European Conference on Wireless Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/4057393/4057394/04057438.pdf","startPage":"63","endPage":"66","publicationTitle":"2006 European Conference on Wireless Technology","doi":"10.1109/ECWT.2006.280435","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ECWT.2006.280435","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4057394","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4057438","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Tilting and Beam-shaping for Traffic Load Balancing in WCDMA Network","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Telecommunication traffic","Multiaccess communication","Loaded antennas","Mobile antennas","Adaptive arrays","Load management","Antenna radiation patterns","Mobile communication","Shape","Context"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive antenna arrays","antenna radiation patterns","broadband networks","cellular radio","code division multiple access","telecommunication traffic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["semismart antenna system","geographic load balancing","cellular mobile communication system","antenna radiation pattern","bubble oscillation algorithm","BOA","adaptively tilting","electrical down-tilt antenna","EDT","traffic load balancing","WCDMA network","wideband code division multiple access"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["semi-smart antenna","Electrical Down-Tilt (EDT)","Wideband CDMA (WCDMA)","Frequency Division Duplexing (FDD)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4057438/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-12 Sept. 2006","displayDocTitle":"Tilting and Beam-shaping for Traffic Load Balancing in WCDMA Network","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4057438/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2006","accessionNumber":"9439708","dateOfInsertion":"15 January 2007","conferenceDate":"10-12 Sept. 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Tilting and Beam-shaping for Traffic Load Balancing in WCDMA Network","confLoc":"Manchester, UK","sourcePdf":"ECWT-00-44.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.033S","chronDate":"10-12 Sept. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4057393","isNumber":"4057394","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4057393","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"4057394","articleId":"4057438","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EUROPEAN MICROWAVE ASSOCIATION","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4057440,"authors":[{"name":"Dariusz Pienkowski","affiliation":["Microwave Engineering Group, Technische Universitat Berlin, Berlin, Germany"],"firstName":"Dariusz","lastName":"Pienkowski","id":"37266291600"},{"name":"Viswanathan Subramanian","affiliation":["Microwave Engineering Group, Technische Universitat Berlin, Berlin, Germany"],"firstName":"Viswanathan","lastName":"Subramanian","id":"37400271800"},{"name":"Georg Boeck","affiliation":["Microwave Engineering Group, Technische Universitat Berlin, Berlin, Germany"],"firstName":"Georg","lastName":"Boeck","id":"37282337800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"2-9600551-5-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4057440","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":84},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Costs","BiCMOS integrated circuits","Energy consumption","Frequency","Electrostatic discharge","Protection","Silicon germanium","Germanium silicon alloys","Gain","Noise figure"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["BiCMOS integrated circuits","electrostatic discharge","Ge-Si alloys","low-power electronics","MMIC amplifiers","protection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["low cost BiCMOS amplifier","power consumption","electrostatic discharge","ESD protection","low-power amplifier","SiGe technology","figure of merit","0.7 V","23 GHz","0.18 micron","11 dB","9 dB","13 dB","2.8 mW","SiGe"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4057440","doi":"10.1109/ECWT.2006.280437","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ECWT.2006.280437","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4057394","publicationTitle":"2006 European Conference on Wireless Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 European Conference on Wireless Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/4057393/4057394/04057440.pdf","startPage":"71","endPage":"74","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A 0.7 V, 23 GHz, low cost BiCMOS amplifier with 2.8 mW power consumption","abstract":"This paper shows a fully integrated, ESD protected, low-power, low-voltage amplifier designed with a low-cost 0.18 mum SiGe technology.

In wireless communication systems, dealing with high PAPR requires keeping an important margin from the power amplifier compression point. High power amplifier back-off leads to low power efficiency which is not suitable in many embedded systems. In this paper, a new iterative technique to reduce the PAPR of multicarrier signals is presented. The proposed technique called \"one-tone one-peak\" (OTOP) is based on the tone reservation principles. It has the advantage to be very easy to implement and to give an appreciable PAPR reduction while giving a full control over the reserved tones magnitude","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 European Conference on Wireless Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/4057393/4057394/04057463.pdf","startPage":"162","endPage":"165","publicationTitle":"2006 European Conference on Wireless Technology","doi":"10.1109/ECWT.2006.280460","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ECWT.2006.280460","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4057394","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4057463","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Innovative and Low Complexity PAPR Reduction Technique for Multicarrier Systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Peak to average power ratio","OFDM modulation","Power amplifiers","Transmitters","Channel coding","High power amplifiers","Partial transmit sequences","Radar","Wireless communication","Embedded system"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["iterative methods","radiocommunication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multicarrier system","wireless communication system","power amplifier compression point","iterative technique","tone reservation principle"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Peak-to-Average Power Ratio","OFDM"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4057463/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-12 Sept. 2006","displayDocTitle":"An Innovative and Low Complexity PAPR Reduction Technique for Multicarrier Systems","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4057463/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2006","accessionNumber":"9439637","dateOfInsertion":"15 January 2007","conferenceDate":"10-12 Sept. 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Innovative and Low Complexity PAPR Reduction Technique for Multicarrier Systems","confLoc":"Manchester, UK","sourcePdf":"ECWT-00-69.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042335S","chronDate":"10-12 Sept. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4057393","isNumber":"4057394","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4057393","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"4057394","articleId":"4057463","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EUROPEAN MICROWAVE ASSOCIATION","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4057465,"authors":[{"name":"T.

We use the Fourier spreading codes at the transmitter with length equal the number of users and across the active users. It leads to the cancellation of the despreading process together with the inverse fast Fourier transformation (IFFT) at the receiver, and hence, we get the performance of SCFDE-CDMA with less complexity. Nevertheless, the system is transformed to OFDM. We obtain multicarrier OFDM, by applying IFFT across an arbitrary parallel SCFDE CDMA signals. The behaviour of the peak to average power ratio PAPR of the output signal reveals Gaussian distribution, and thus, the PAPR is improved.

Digital-controlled adaptive analog predistortion, used to linearize the PA, is implemented at minimal cost by exploiting analog computing and high levels of integration found in commercial parts. Memoryless distortion is corrected by adapting a small number of coefficients with the goal of making the AM-AM and AM-PM curves flat across the range of input envelope levels. The prototype amplifier is shown to meet the UMTS spectral mask for an output power level of 30 watts. The measured distortion cancellation is 17 dB at the 4 MHz offset from the carrier.

By feeding the slot with a microstrip line, a triple-resonance response is obtained from the chassis, slot and microstrip stub interaction, providing sufficient impedance bandwidth and radiation efficiency to cover the 0.9-2.7 GHz frequency range. While the introduction of a slot in the ground plane has many advantages over e.g. PIFA or patch structures, both in terms of performance and cost, the circuit floor planning becomes more complicated. To address this problem, a possible solution in terms of module partitioning and signal line routing is suggested.

The observed deviations between the original simulation and measurements have been explained by extensive use of 3D EM simulations of the coplanar passive structures","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4057577/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-13 Sept. 2006","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"10-13 Sept. 2006","htmlLink":"/document/4057577/","dateOfInsertion":"15 January 2007","publicationDate":"Sept. 2006","accessionNumber":"9420709","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Design and Analysis of a 34 dBm Ka-Band GaN High Power Amplifier MMIC","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design and Analysis of a 34 dBm Ka-Band GaN High Power Amplifier MMIC","confLoc":"Manchester, UK","sourcePdf":"EMICC-00-48.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.039557S","chronDate":"10-13 Sept. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4057528","isNumber":"4057529","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4057528","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4057529","articleId":"4057577","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EUROPEAN MICROWAVE ASSOC","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4057578,"authors":[{"name":"Paolo Colantonio","affiliation":["Department of Electronics Engineering, University of Roma Tor Vergata, Rome, Italy"],"firstName":"Paolo","lastName":"Colantonio","id":"37266452400"},{"name":"Franco Giannini","affiliation":["Department of Electronics Engineering, University of Roma Tor Vergata, Rome, Italy"],"firstName":"Franco","lastName":"Giannini","id":"37266455000"},{"name":"Lucio Scucchia","affiliation":["Department of Electronics Engineering, University of Roma Tor Vergata, Rome, Italy"],"firstName":"Lucio","lastName":"Scucchia","id":"37282213000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"2-9600551-8-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4057578","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":491},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Design methodology","Network synthesis","Admittance","Frequency synthesizers","Termination of employment","Circuit synthesis","Microwave theory and techniques","Microwave integrated circuits","Design engineering","Integrated circuit synthesis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["harmonic analysis","network synthesis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["harmonic matching","closed-form synthesis","distributed networks","stub","closed form synthesis","harmonic termination"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Matching","distributed network","stub","closed form synthesis","harmonic termination"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4057578","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Method to Design Distributed Harmonic Matching Networks","doi":"10.1109/EMICC.2006.282755","startPage":"79","endPage":"82","publicationTitle":"2006 European Microwave Integrated Circuits Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 European Microwave Integrated Circuits Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4057528/4057529/04057578.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4057529","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EMICC.2006.282755","abstract":"In this paper a closed-form synthesis of distributed networks for harmonic matching is presented.

A 16-QAM modulation scheme has been used as input signal. Nonlinearities caused by the amplifier operating at low input back-off (IBO), that is close to compression, can change the output constellation and lead to difficulties in finding the correct model parameters since the black-box identification procedure is based on measured input/output signals. A segment of the input/output measurement data is processed to generate an initial model. Then pseudo-inverse techniques are used to find a parsimonious Wiener model that is cross-validated with the entire measurement data. The presented modeling approach results in a model intended to be numerically robust and having a high identification percentage based on the normalized mean squared error (NMSE) figure of merit. Once the PA model is obtained, a Hammerstein based predistorter (HPD) is estimated by means of the indirect learning approach (PA input-output measured data). Simulation and experimental results are provided in order to show linearity improvement achieved by this HPD. In band and out of band distortion compensation are measured in terms of adjacent channel power ratio (ACPR) and error vector magnitude (EVM) reduction","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Predistortion","Distortion measurement","Microwave amplifiers","Power amplifiers","Signal design","Constellation diagram","Signal processing","Robustness","Linearity","Power measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["microwave power amplifiers","nonlinear distortion","quadrature amplitude modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["digital predistortion","Hammerstein model","Wiener model","microwave power amplifier","quadrature amplitude modulation","distortion compensation","adjacent channel power ratio","error vector magnitude reduction"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Digital predistortion","Hammerstein model","power amplifier modeling","Wiener model"]}],"doi":"10.1109/EMICC.2006.282803","publicationTitle":"2006 European Microwave Integrated Circuits Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 European Microwave Integrated Circuits Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4057528/4057529/04057626.pdf","startPage":"265","endPage":"268","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4057529","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EMICC.2006.282803","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"RF-Power Amplifier Modeling and Predistortion Based on a Modular Approach","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4057626","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"RF-Power Amplifier Modeling and Predistortion Based on a Modular Approach","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4057626/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2006","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4057626/","accessionNumber":"9462079","conferenceDate":"10-13 Sept. 2006","dateOfInsertion":"15 January 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-13 Sept. 2006","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"RF-Power Amplifier Modeling and Predistortion Based on a Modular Approach","confLoc":"Manchester, UK","sourcePdf":"EMICC-00-97.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.038092S","chronDate":"10-13 Sept. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4057528","isNumber":"4057529","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4057528","xplore-issue":"4057529","articleId":"4057626","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EUROPEAN MICROWAVE ASSOC","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4057629,"authors":[{"name":"Kenichi Miyaguchi","affiliation":["Mitsubishi Electric Corporation Limited, Kamakura, Kanagawa, Japan"],"firstName":"Kenichi","lastName":"Miyaguchi","id":"37298312900"},{"name":"Morishige Hieda","affiliation":["Mitsubishi Electric Corporation Limited, Kamakura, Kanagawa, Japan"],"firstName":"Morishige","lastName":"Hieda","id":"37298284600"},{"name":"Masatake Hangai","affiliation":["Mitsubishi Electric Corporation Limited, Kamakura, Kanagawa, Japan"],"firstName":"Masatake","lastName":"Hangai","id":"37296457600"},{"name":"Tamotsu Nishino","affiliation":["Mitsubishi Electric Corporation Limited, Kamakura, Kanagawa, Japan"],"firstName":"Tamotsu","lastName":"Nishino","id":"37282162600"},{"name":"Norihiro Yunoue","affiliation":["Mitsubishi Electric Corporation Limited, Kamakura, Kanagawa, Japan"],"firstName":"Norihiro","lastName":"Yunoue","id":"37375246700"},{"name":"Yoshinobu Sasaki","affiliation":["Mitsubishi Electric Corporation Limited, Kamakura, Kanagawa, Japan"],"firstName":"Yoshinobu","lastName":"Sasaki","id":"37289205200"},{"name":"Moriyasu Miyazaki","affiliation":["Mitsubishi Electric Corporation Limited, Kamakura, Kanagawa, Japan"],"firstName":"Moriyasu","lastName":"Miyazaki","id":"37280521400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"2-9600551-8-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4057629","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":601},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MMICs","Phase shifters","Circuits","Cutoff frequency","Bandwidth","Insertion loss","FETs","Inductors","Phased arrays","Costs"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["lumped parameter networks","microwave phase shifters","MMIC","network topology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ultra compact C-band","MMIC phase shifter","all pass network","lumped element","network topology","transition frequency","digital phase shifters","360 C"]}],"abstract":"An ultra compact 5-bit MMIC phase shifter, operating in the C-band, is presented.

The simulation results have revealed a wealth of new physical features, which are, to our best knowledge, seen for the first time. A comparative analysis of pulse propagation on coupled lines in a homogeneous medium, and on single and coupled lines with layered substrates has been used to elucidate the mechanisms of pulse distortion and crosstalk and to discriminate the effects of dispersion and coupling. It is demonstrated that the coupling to some extent compensates dispersion, thus reducing pulse distortion on source line and crosstalk. Complex line arrangements with pedestal substrates and additional conducting walls have been studied with the aim of reducing interference of the pulsed signals on closely spaced printed traces.

Two 1.2GHz amplifiers were designed using a large-signal model of an LDMOSFET: one had harmonics control circuits optimized for external current/voltage waveforms and another had them optimized for internal waveforms. Simulation of the class-F amplifiers with two different output networks was conducted.

The algorithm is based on rational interpolation, which leads to more accurate RF/microwave models as compared to other existing interpolants, e.g. spline. Starting with a minimal number of support points i.e. EM data and with lowest-order rational functions, the algorithm systematically produces a rational function model, which meets a user-specified accuracy. In each stage of the algorithm, additional poles and/or zeros are added, and new support points are adaptively selected based on a statistical criterion. The algorithm distinguishes critical regions of an EM component's behavior that need to be densely sampled and uses relatively fewer data in other regions.

In conventional methodologies, the layout parasitics are known only after the layout is complete and the schematic is resized to compensate for these parasitics. The drawback of such a methodology is that the convergence of this design iteration remains unpredictable. This paper proposes a novel synthesis and verification flow for RFIC designs. The design flow is composed of three stages: circuit sizing with floorplan, performance-aware floorplan refinement, and full-wave electromagnetic (EM) extraction. Layout parasitics are considered throughout the design flow in the proposed methodology. As a result, parasitic closure can be achieved quickly and design iterations may not be required. As an example, the proposed design flow is applied to a cross-coupled inductance-capacitance (LC) VCO. Demonstrating the efficiency of the proposed flow for RFIC designs, it required only two weeks to meet all the design specifications with no iterations","doi":"10.1109/EUMC.2006.281498","publicationTitle":"2006 European Microwave Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 European Microwave Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4057701/4057702/04057904.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EUMC.2006.281498","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4057702","startPage":"664","endPage":"667","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Novel Parasitic-Aware Synthesis and Verification Flow for RFIC Design","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4057904","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A Novel Parasitic-Aware Synthesis and Verification Flow for RFIC Design","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-15 Sept. 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4057904/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"10-15 Sept. 2006","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2006","accessionNumber":"9407148","dateOfInsertion":"15 January 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4057904/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Novel Parasitic-Aware Synthesis and Verification Flow for RFIC Design","confLoc":"Manchester, UK","sourcePdf":"EUMC-00-202.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057448S","chronDate":"10-15 Sept. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4057701","isNumber":"4057702","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4057701","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4057702","articleId":"4057904","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EUROPEAN MICROWAVE ASSOCIATION","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4057908,"authors":[{"name":"Bill O'Brien","affiliation":["School of Electrical, University College Dublin, Dublin 4, Ireland"],"firstName":"Bill","lastName":"O'Brien","id":"37841643700"},{"name":"John Dooley","affiliation":["School of Electrical, University College Dublin, Dublin 4, Ireland"],"firstName":"John","lastName":"Dooley","id":"37268227100"},{"name":"Anding Zhu","affiliation":["School of Electrical, University College Dublin, Dublin 4, Ireland"],"firstName":"Anding","lastName":"Zhu","id":"37277394200"},{"name":"Thomas J.

If too short a memory length is considered, it is not possible to fully characterize the PA, whereas using an excessively long memory length results in a slower, less efficient model. Therefore, it is vital to find the optimum memory length during model extraction. In this paper we present a novel approach to estimating the optimum memory length required for accurate behavioral modeling of RF power amplifiers.

To avoid such iterative solution methods, analytical design equations should be known. The problem associated with the finite dc feed inductance class-E PA is usually ascribed to the fact that the circuit element values are transcendental functions of the input parameters which is assumed to prevent the derivation of exact or fully analytical design equations. Using a proper analytical method, exact design solutions for class-E PA with any inductor value can however be derived. A mathematically exact analysis of the idealized class-E PA with finite dc feed inductance has been done and analytical expressions showing the relation between the circuit elements and the input parameters are found. These analytical expressions have been simplified to obtain explicit, relatively simple design equations. In this paper, it presents these relatively simple design equations. Using these design equations, class-E PA with finite dc feed inductance can be designed without iterative design procedures. The current paper discusses these simplified versions of the exact solution of general class-E PA with finite dc feed inductance, and discusses some implications of these design equations","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 European Microwave Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4057701/4057702/04058071.pdf","startPage":"1308","endPage":"1311","publicationTitle":"2006 European Microwave Conference","doi":"10.1109/EUMC.2006.281237","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EUMC.2006.281237","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4057702","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4058071","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Generalized Design Equations for Class-E Power Amplifiers with Finite DC Feed Inductance","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power amplifiers","Feeds","Inductance","Circuits","Switches","Nonlinear equations","Voltage","Frequency","Iterative methods","Design methodology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["iterative methods","power amplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["class-E power amplifiers","finite DC feed inductance","iterative solution procedure","mathematically exact analysis","circuit elements"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Power Amplifier","Class-E"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4058071/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-15 Sept. 2006","displayDocTitle":"Generalized Design Equations for Class-E Power Amplifiers with Finite DC Feed Inductance","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4058071/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2006","accessionNumber":"9407226","dateOfInsertion":"15 January 2007","conferenceDate":"10-15 Sept. 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Generalized Design Equations for Class-E Power Amplifiers with Finite DC Feed Inductance","confLoc":"Manchester, UK","sourcePdf":"EUMC-00-369.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.099545S","chronDate":"10-15 Sept. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4057701","isNumber":"4057702","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4057701","citationCount":"30","xplore-issue":"4057702","articleId":"4058071","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EUROPEAN MICROWAVE ASSOCIATION","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4058076,"authors":[{"name":"Ming-sze Tong","affiliation":["Institute of Electronics and Telecommunications of Rennes, University of Rennes I, Rennes, France","School of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Chung Ang University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Ming-sze","lastName":"Tong","id":"37069105800"},{"name":"Artem Boriskin","affiliation":["Institute of Radio Physics and Electronics, National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine, Ukraine"],"firstName":"Artem","lastName":"Boriskin","id":"37282294800"},{"name":"Ronan Sauleau","affiliation":["Institute of Electronics and Telecommunications of Rennes, University of Rennes I, Rennes, France"],"firstName":"Ronan","lastName":"Sauleau","id":"37278796800"},{"name":"Tae-gyu Chang","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Chung Ang University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Tae-gyu","lastName":"Chang","id":"37279408800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"2-9600551-6-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4058076","dbTime":"52 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":101},"abstract":"This paper presents some studies on electromagnetic wave propagation and absorption performance at boundary through an in-house developed solver based on a body-of-revolution finite-difference time-domain (BOR-FDTD) method.

The MMIC chip size is 2.55 mm times 1.4 mm, in contrast the voltage converter has the size of 0.35 mm times 0.70 mm. The measured tuning sensitivity of 97 plusmn 12 MHz/V is achieved for voltages between 0 V and 5 V, and the temperature dependency is very small. Also the phase noise performance is -110.7 dBc/Hz at 1MHz offset from the carrier when the oscillation frequency is 38.2 GHz.

This terminology is now appearing in the radar literature, but in several forms causing some confusion. Much of the existing work has focused on multistatic radars with sufficient spatial separation to de-correlate target RCS fluctuations, and where the data from the radars are combined incoherently. Another form of MIMO radar, closer to the communications technique, is where multiple orthogonal signals from the individual transmitter elements of a phased array are coherently combined on reception to form multiple beams. This paper presents a simple understanding of this within-aperture MIMO technique. We show how a filled array of \"phantom\" elements can be formed from relatively few physical elements. We explain the phantom element concept and extend it to the synthesis of various antenna array configurations, covering one, two and three dimensional geometries.

The method is based on the theory of modal analysis and involves an original convex optimization procedure which benefits from the Parseval relation. The optimized beampattern is obtained by numerically minimizing the worst-case error between the modal coefficients of the array response and those of the reference beampattern, up to a finite rank of the series expansion, over a frequency grid.

It is required to obtain positional and angular signals around 1,000 Hz to control a mechanical system. A vision sensor must obtain visual features of a target object, synchronizing its sampling rate to the sampling rate of the control. Thus, we need 1) image capturing over 1,000 Hz with high resolution, 2) visual feature computation at the capturing rate, and 3) visual feature transmission to a control system with little delay. We propose the CMOS+FPGA vision system to realize 1,000 Hz visual feedback. This system consists of a CMOS image detector to capture images at 1,000 Hz and an FPGA to compute image features at this sampling rate.

The vision system is composed of a binocular camera head and high speed image sensors. The camera head is originally designed to mount neuromorphic vision chips fabricated using three-dimensional integration technology. The prototype of the neuromorphic vision chip has three layers: (1) photoreceptor layer, (2) horizontal and bipolar cell layer, and (3) ganglion cell layer. An image sensor is separately developed, which corresponds to the photoreceptor layer of the layered vision chip. The image sensors are tentatively mounted on the camera head, since the resolution of the prototype of the layered vision chip is not sufficient at this stage. The camera head has an azimuth DOF for each eye and a common elevation DOF. The weight of the camera head is strictly limited, since it is mounted on a mobile robot. In order to satisfy both demands for the quick movements and light weight, the camera head is designed based upon a simple parallel mechanism. The total performance of the vision system is examined in this work.

The key contribution of this work is an optimal algorithm for merging (not necessarily overlapping) maps that are created by different robots independently. Relative pose measurements between pairs of robots are processed to compute the coordinate transformation between any two maps. Noise in the robot-to-robot observations, propagated through the map-alignment process, increases the error in the position estimates of the transformed landmarks, and reduces the overall accuracy of the merged map. When there is overlap between the two maps, landmarks that appear twice provide additional information, in the form of constraints, which increases the alignment accuracy. Landmark duplicates are identified through a fast nearest-neighbor matching algorithm. In order to reduce the computational complexity of this search process, a kd-tree is used to represent the landmarks in the original map. The criterion employed for matching any two landmarks is the Mahalanobis distance. As a means of validation, we present experimental results obtained from two robots mapping an area of 4,800 m\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multi-robot SLAM with Unknown Initial Correspondence: The Robot Rendezvous Case","publicationTitle":"2006 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems","doi":"10.1109/IROS.2006.282219","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4058334/4058335/04058636.pdf","startPage":"1785","endPage":"1792","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IROS.2006.282219","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4058335","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4058636","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4058636/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-15 Oct. 2006","displayDocTitle":"Multi-robot SLAM with Unknown Initial Correspondence: The Robot Rendezvous Case","conferenceDate":"9-15 Oct. 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4058636/","dateOfInsertion":"15 January 2007","publicationDate":"Oct. 2006","accessionNumber":"9429989","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multi-robot SLAM with Unknown Initial Correspondence: The Robot Rendezvous Case","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"IROS-00-301.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.097431S","chronDate":"9-15 Oct. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4058334","isNumber":"4058335","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4058334","citationCount":"118","xplore-issue":"4058335","articleId":"4058636","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-22"},{"_id":4058659,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaojun Tian","affiliation":["Graduate school of Chinese Academy of sciences, Beijing, China","Robotics Laboratory of CAS, Shenyang Institute of Automation, China"],"firstName":"Xiaojun","lastName":"Tian","id":"37279245700"},{"name":"Yuechao Wang","affiliation":["Robotics Laboratory of CAS, Shenyang Institute of Automation, China"],"firstName":"Yuechao","lastName":"Wang","id":"37281424700"},{"name":"Ning Xi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Michigan State University, USA"],"firstName":"Ning","lastName":"Xi","id":"37274126400"},{"name":"Zaili Dong","affiliation":["Robotics Laboratory of CAS, Shenyang Institute of Automation, China"],"firstName":"Zaili","lastName":"Dong","id":"37275835300"},{"name":"Wenjung Li","affiliation":["Robotics Laboratory of CAS, Shenyang Institute of Automation, China"],"firstName":"Wenjung","lastName":"Li","id":"37278915600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0258-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0259-X","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2153-0858"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-0866"}],"articleNumber":"4058659","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":113},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4058659","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Probes","Actuators","Kinematics","Intelligent robots","Robotics and automation","Sensor systems","Hysteresis","Voltage","Content addressable storage","Robot sensing systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["atomic force microscopy","hysteresis","manipulator kinematics","micromanipulators","nanopositioning","piezoelectric actuators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["AFM probe positioning","AFM based robotic nanomanipulation system","hysteresis analysis","nonlinear characteristics analysis","AFM PZT actuator","actuating method","scanning trajectory","kinematics coupling errors","tube actuator bend motion","probe tip positioning errors","cantilever deflections","nanopatterning experiments","atomic force microscope"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["AFM probe positioning","Reappearing the scanning trajectory","Kinematicss coupling errors","Cantilever deflections","Nanomanipulation"]}],"doi":"10.1109/IROS.2006.282317","pdfPath":"/iel5/4058334/4058335/04058659.pdf","publicationTitle":"2006 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems","startPage":"1910","endPage":"1914","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4058335","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IROS.2006.282317","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Accurate Positioning of AFM Probe for AFM Based Robotic Nanomanipulation System","abstract":"For AFM based robotic nanomanipulation system without displacement sensor, one of the key technical problems is to realize high accurate positioning of the AFM probe.

Then two kinds of probe positioning errors, namely kinematics coupling errors due to the tube actuator's bend motion and probe tip's positioning errors caused by cantilever deflections, are compensated to further improve the probe's positioning accuracy. Nanopatterning experiments are performed to verify the effectiveness of the new actuating method and the compensation methods of probe positioning errors","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4058659/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9397686","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4058659/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2006","dateOfInsertion":"15 January 2007","conferenceDate":"9-15 Oct. 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Accurate Positioning of AFM Probe for AFM Based Robotic Nanomanipulation System","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Accurate Positioning of AFM Probe for AFM Based Robotic Nanomanipulation System","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"IROS-00-324.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05175S","chronDate":"Oct.  2006","xplore-pub-id":"4058334","isNumber":"4058335","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4058334","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4058335","articleId":"4058659","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4058711,"authors":[{"name":"Vadiraj Hombal","affiliation":["Electrical, Computer, and Systems Engineering Department, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Troy, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Vadiraj","lastName":"Hombal","id":"37444102300"},{"name":"Arthur C.

Such strategies utilize a representation of sensor variable fields as a basis for the selection of sample points. In this paper a curvature based criterion for sample selection is presented. The curvature-sensitive sampling algorithm (CSS) utilizes the estimated second-derivative of an intermediate variable field to select sample points of interest for complex process models, such as used in oceanographic sampling with AUVs. For processes for which little or no prior knowledge base exists, an iterative curvature-based adaptive sampling algorithm (ICASA) is presented. The ICASA algorithm iteratively selects sets of sample locations based on non-parametric field representations. These algorithms are evaluated with respect to simulated data, experimental data, and data from oceanographic models. The performance is shown to be significantly better than the conventional uniform grid methodology.

This paper reports on: (1) the mapping to the SES of images with much higher resolution than the SES itself, and (2) the processing of visual attention on the SES. Described is a procedure to store spatially-overlapping imagery in the SES database and to generate and update a spherical composite of its visual contents. The composite image serves both as a visual map of the locale and as a representation of the local contents of the underlying full-resolution imagery. Visual attention enables fast alignment of overlapping images without warping or position optimization, since an attentional point (AP) on the composite typically corresponds to one on each of the collocated regions in the images. Such alignment speeds analysis of the multiple images of the area. Compositing and attention were performed two ways and compared: (1) APs were computed directly on the composite and not on the full resolution images until the time of retrieval. (2) The attentional operator was applied to all incoming imagery. Then the locations and values of the APs on the composite were computed as a function of those points within the corresponding regions of the collocated images.

In this paper, a SLAM scheme based on visual object recognition, not just a scene matching, in home environment is proposed without using artificial landmarks. For the object-based SLAM, the following algorithms are suggested: 1) a novel local invariant feature extraction by combining advantages of multi-scale Harris corner as a detector and its SIFT descriptor for natural object recognition, 2) the RANSAC clustering for robust object recognition in the presence of outliers and 3) calculating accurate metric information for SLAM update. The proposed algorithms increase robustness by correct data association and accurate observation. Moreover, it also can be easily implemented real-time by reducing the number of representative landmarks, i.e. objects.

Sphere-based geometric models are used for the human and robot due to the efficiency of the distance computation. The collision avoidance algorithm searches for collision-free paths by moving the end-effector along a set of pre-defined search directions. An optimization method is employed to select the search direction that balances between the robot approaching its goal location, and maximizing the distances between the human and robot models. The optimization incorporates predictions of the motions of the robot and human to reduce the negative effects of a non-instantaneous robot time response. The robot prediction is based on a transfer function model of its experimental time response at the joint level. The human prediction is performed at the sphere level using the weighted mean of past velocities. Predicting at the sphere level eliminates the difficulty introduced by the limbs moving in different directions. After describing the collision avoidance algorithm, a human walking towards a moving Puma robot arm is simulated. Captured motion data is used to make the human motion realistic. Monte Carlo simulations using 1000 random human walking paths passing through the robot workspace are used to evaluate the algorithm. The algorithm prevented all collisions due to the robot. The algorithm is deterministic and efficient enough to be used in real-time.

The devices derive bending actuation not from tendon wires or other external mechanisms, but from elastic energy stored in the backbone itself. This allows active cannulas to have a small diameter and a high degree of dexterity, which should enable them to navigate through complex anatomy to sites inaccessible by current surgical robotic devices. Active cannulas may also enhance patient safety because their inherent compliance mitigates potential trauma from inadvertent tool-tissue collision. A consequence of our design is that dexterity improves with miniaturization. A kinematic description of active cannula shape requires a model of the elastic interaction of telescoping pre-curved flexible tubes, and we derive a two-link beam mechanics-based model.

The advances in field programmable gate array (FPGA) technology offer a system on programmable chip (SoPC) solution to this demand. This paper describes the technical achievement in developing FPGA-based control system which utilizes the hardware/software re-configurable feature of the advanced FPGA device to achieve the goal. We have implemented the hardware module inside the FPGA chip to generate PWM output and to count quadrate encoder pulses, which are the basic building blocks to drive DC motors. Software is developed to implement PID control algorithm using the PWM-encoder module and on-chip processor. The functional correctness of the closed-loop control system is verified by the experimental tests. The performance analysis shows that the hardware module occupies less FPGA space and the power dissipation is very much comparable to other design alternatives of similar caliber. The preliminary results demonstrate that the PWM-encoder module, in the form of user intellectual property (IP), can be duplicated and re-configured to control as many motors as needed. The success gives us a confidence boost to continue our effort to build user IP library for robotics applications which will benefit the robotics community by providing development tools and FPGA building blocks to satisfy the demand for an extremely flexible, high-performance, onboard computing unit","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Control systems","Robots","Field programmable gate arrays","Pulse width modulation","Hardware","DC motors","DC generators","Pulse generation","Space vector pulse width modulation","Three-term control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["closed loop systems","field programmable gate arrays","industrial property","microcontrollers","microrobots","pulse width modulation","system-on-chip","three-term control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FPGA-based control system","resource-constrained miniature robots","field programmable gate array","system on programmable chip","PID control","closed-loop control system","PWM-encoder module","intellectual property"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["FPGA","PID control","climbing robot","system on programmable chip"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4058926","doi":"10.1109/IROS.2006.282576","startPage":"3399","endPage":"3404","publicationTitle":"2006 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4058334/4058335/04058926.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4058335","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IROS.2006.282576","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4058926/","displayDocTitle":"FPGA-based Control System for Miniature Robots","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"9-15 Oct. 2006","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2006","dateOfInsertion":"15 January 2007","accessionNumber":"9407799","htmlLink":"/document/4058926/","conferenceDate":"9-15 Oct. 2006","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FPGA-based Control System for Miniature Robots","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"IROS-00-591.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.093473S","chronDate":"9-15 Oct. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4058334","isNumber":"4058335","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4058334","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"4058335","articleId":"4058926","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4058955,"authors":[{"name":"Tim Bailey","affiliation":["Australian Centre for Field Robotics, University of Sydney, NSW, Australia"],"firstName":"Tim","lastName":"Bailey","id":"37432980100"},{"name":"Juan Nieto","affiliation":["Australian Centre for Field Robotics, University of Sydney, NSW, Australia"],"firstName":"Juan","lastName":"Nieto","id":"37085778635"},{"name":"Jose Guivant","affiliation":["Australian Centre for Field Robotics, University of Sydney, NSW, Australia"],"firstName":"Jose","lastName":"Guivant","id":"37273523700"},{"name":"Michael Stevens","affiliation":["Australian Centre for Field Robotics, University of Sydney, NSW, Australia"],"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Stevens","id":"38253414100"},{"name":"Eduardo Nebot","affiliation":["Australian Centre for Field Robotics, University of Sydney, NSW, Australia"],"firstName":"Eduardo","lastName":"Nebot","id":"37273559500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0258-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0259-X","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2153-0858"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-0866"}],"articleNumber":"4058955","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":257,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":3812},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Simultaneous localization and mapping","Uncertainty","Vehicles","Intelligent robots","Australia","Filters","Degradation","Large-scale systems","Probability distribution","Context modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Kalman filters","mobile robots","SLAM (robots)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["extended Kalman filter","simultaneous localisation and mapping","SLAM","large-scale maps","mobile robots"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4058955","abstract":"This paper presents an analysis of the extended Kalman filter formulation of simultaneous localisation and mapping (EKF-SLAM).

Such a robot system is usually equipped with visual sensors, which always require calibration before used. The calibration process is often complicated. In this paper a neural network is used to learn the relationship between the world coordinate information and the image information, instead of computing accurate camera parameters. The neural network is first trained based on sample data by using the 2D and 3D coordinates of some control points on a standard pattern. During the tracking stage, images captured by cameras are firstly changed into binary images. The curve is then thinned and its position on the image is recorded. From the image data, the curve's position in the world coordinate frame can be specified by using the trained neural network. The curve tracked can be arbitrary, open or closed.

A method for discriminating a property of an object with the use of generated sound when striking it with a hammer is called a hammering test. This method can investigate non-visual features of objects such as inner structure of objects, e.g., the existence of defects and cracks inside objects. However, this method depends on human experience and skills. In addition, if we perform this test over a wide area of objects, it is required to manually record hammering positions one by one. To solve these problems, this paper proposes a hammering test system consisting of two video cameras that can acquire image and sound signals of a hammering scene. The shape of the object (visual feature) is measured by the image signal processing from the result of 3-D measurement of each hammering position, and the thickness or material (non-visual feature) is estimated by the sound signal processing in time and frequency domains. The validity of proposed method is shown through experiments","doi":"10.1109/IROS.2006.281790","publicationTitle":"2006 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4058334/4058335/04059004.pdf","startPage":"3837","endPage":"3842","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IROS.2006.281790","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4058335","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Inspection of Visible and Invisible Features of Objects with Image and Sound Signal Processing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4059004","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-15 Oct. 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4059004/","displayDocTitle":"Inspection of Visible and Invisible Features of Objects with Image and Sound Signal Processing","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2006","accessionNumber":"9419381","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4059004/","conferenceDate":"9-15 Oct. 2006","dateOfInsertion":"15 January 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Inspection of Visible and Invisible Features of Objects with Image and Sound Signal Processing","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"IROS-00-669.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057087S","chronDate":"9-15 Oct. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4058334","isNumber":"4058335","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4058334","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"4058335","articleId":"4059004","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4059012,"authors":[{"name":"Stefan Klanke","affiliation":["Neuroinformatics Group, Faculty of Technology, University of Bielefeld, Bielefeld, Germany"],"firstName":"Stefan","lastName":"Klanke","id":"37427150000"},{"name":"Dmitry Lebedev","affiliation":["Neuroinformatics Group, Faculty of Technology, University of Bielefeld, Bielefeld, Germany"],"firstName":"Dmitry","lastName":"Lebedev","id":"37564642000"},{"name":"Robert Haschke","affiliation":["Neuroinformatics Group, Faculty of Technology, University of Bielefeld, Bielefeld, Germany"],"firstName":"Robert","lastName":"Haschke","id":"37565751900"},{"name":"Jochen Steil","affiliation":["Neuroinformatics Group, Faculty of Technology, University of Bielefeld, Bielefeld, Germany"],"firstName":"Jochen","lastName":"Steil","id":"37328304300"},{"name":"Helge Ritter","affiliation":["Neuroinformatics Group, Faculty of Technology, University of Bielefeld, Bielefeld, Germany"],"firstName":"Helge","lastName":"Ritter","id":"37266153900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0258-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0259-X","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2153-0858"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-0866"}],"articleNumber":"4059012","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":18,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1173},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4059012","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Path planning","Robot kinematics","Motion planning","Manipulator dynamics","Orbital robotics","Robustness","Service robots","Intelligent robots","Neural networks","Mobile robots"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["control engineering computing","neural nets","path planning","redundant manipulators","robust control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dynamic path planning","7DOF robot arm","online robust path planner","redundant Mitsubishi PA-10 arm","nonstationary environments","arm kinematic model","3D position planning","Cartesian space","3D space","orientation planning","dynamic wave expansion neural network","DWENN algorithm"]}],"abstract":"We present an on-line, robust, and efficient path planner for the redundant Mitsubishi PA-10 arm with 7 degrees of freedom (DOF) in non-stationary environments.

Position and orientation planning are interweaving and performed \"on-the-fly\" without explicit global knowledge of the environment using two instances of the dynamic wave expansion neural network (DWENN), an effective method for path generation in arbitrarily changing environments.

The mechanical configuration and the control system are described. The rhythmic movements of swimming are driven by the biological neural networks, called the central pattern generators (CPGs). The CPGs are modeled as nonlinear oscillators for joints and inter-joint coordination is achieved by altering the connection weights between joints. The CPG-based online gait generation method allows elegant and smooth transitions between swimming gaits, which result in multi-mode swimming to implement more lifelike locomotion. Several swimming modes can be obtained to mimic diverse actions of the real fish in nature, or designed according to special assignments by changing CPG parameters. The up-and-down motion can be implemented by adjusting the rotating angle of pectoral fins. The depth of the robotic fish is controlled utilizing a proportional-integral-derivative (PID) control algorithm according to the feedback of depth information measured by the sonar sensor installed at the bottom of the fish.

These provide short paths and alternative routes which allow for variation in the routes a moving object can take. We will show how to incorporate such cycles.

Therefore, it is beneficial if the vehicle is able to estimate, which terrain it is currently traversing. Using this estimation, the vehicle can adapt its driving style to the terrain. In this paper, we present a method for terrain classification based on vibration induced in the vehicle's body. An accelerometer mounted on the vehicle measures the vibration perpendicular to the ground surface. We experimentally compare representations of the data based on the fast Fourier transform (FFT) and on the power spectral density (PSD). Additionally, we suggest a simpler and more compact representation based on features calculated from the raw data vectors and a combination of this representation with the PSD.

After labeling to remove the noises and thinning, a genetic algorithm is applied to these preprocessing images to search the best fitting curve, which determines the barycenter position of glomerulus and set this barycenter as seed. Secondly, the image which contains complete object boundary can be obtained through watershed transform, after region growing operation, glomerulus region can be extracted.

We introduce a novel algorithm based on generalized regression neural network (GRNN) which can interpolate unknown volxes fast and reliable.

Unlike previous approaches, we achieve this without the need for explicit segmentation of the surface in the image, and using complete optical estimation (i.e. no affine models) in the control loop. A simple proportional control law is used to regulate the vehicle's velocity, using only the raw, unfiltered flow divergence as input. Central to the robustness of our approach is the derivation of a time-to-contact estimator that accounts for small rotations of the robot during ego-motion. We present both analytical and experimental results showing that through tracking of the focus of expansion to a looming surface, we may compensate for such rotations, thereby significantly improving the robustness of the time-to-contact estimate. This is demonstrated using an off-board natural image sequence, and in closed-loop control of a mobile robot","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4058334/4058335/04059317.pdf","startPage":"5564","endPage":"5569","publicationTitle":"2006 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems","doi":"10.1109/IROS.2006.282273","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IROS.2006.282273","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4058335","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4059317","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Robust Docking Strategy for a Mobile Robot using Flow Field Divergence","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Robustness","Mobile robots","Image motion analysis","Optical sensors","Biomedical optical imaging","Image segmentation","Motion estimation","Australia","Focusing","Velocity control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["closed loop systems","compensation","estimation theory","image sequences","mobile robots","motion control","proportional control","robot vision","robust control","velocity control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["robust docking strategy","mobile robots","optical flow field divergence","optical estimation","proportional control law","vehicle velocity regulation","time-to-contact estimator","robot ego-motion","rotation compensation","off-board natural image sequence","closed-loop control"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4059317/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-15 Oct. 2006","displayDocTitle":"A Robust Docking Strategy for a Mobile Robot using Flow Field Divergence","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4059317/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2006","accessionNumber":"9430102","dateOfInsertion":"15 January 2007","conferenceDate":"9-15 Oct. 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Robust Docking Strategy for a Mobile Robot using Flow Field Divergence","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"IROS-00-982.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054249S","chronDate":"9-15 Oct. 2006","isNumber":"4058335","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4058334","citationCount":"5","articleId":"4059317","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4059335,"authors":[{"name":"Antonio Morales","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Jaume, Spain"],"firstName":"Antonio","lastName":"Morales","id":"37325242000"},{"name":"Tamim Asfour","affiliation":["Institute of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Karlsruhe, Karlsruhe, Germany"],"firstName":"Tamim","lastName":"Asfour","id":"37295529100"},{"name":"Pedram Azad","affiliation":["Institute of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Karlsruhe, Karlsruhe, Germany"],"firstName":"Pedram","lastName":"Azad","id":"37283945100"},{"name":"Steffen Knoop","affiliation":["Institute of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Karlsruhe, Karlsruhe, Germany"],"firstName":"Steffen","lastName":"Knoop","id":"37273102600"},{"name":"Rudiger Dillmann","affiliation":["Institute of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Karlsruhe, Karlsruhe, Germany"],"firstName":"Rudiger","lastName":"Dillmann","id":"37280242100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0258-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0259-X","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2153-0858"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-0866"}],"articleNumber":"4059335","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":60,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":715},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Humanoid robots","Robot kinematics","Grasping","Databases","Humans","Computer science","Real time systems","Fingers","Robot sensing systems","Shape"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CAD","control engineering computing","dexterous manipulators","humanoid robots","robot vision","stereo image processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["grasp planning","visual object localization","humanoid robot arm","five-fingered hands","object grasping","kitchen environment","object model database","object representation","exhaustive offline grasp analysis system","real-time stereo vision system","CAD models","grasp execution modules","stereo camera system","real-time object localization","manipulation task goals"]}],"abstract":"In this paper we present a framework for grasp planning with a humanoid robot arm and a five-fingered hand.

In contrast with previous approaches, this technique does not use any specific model of the omnidirectional sensor. It only assumes that the imaging function can be described by a Taylor series expansion whose coefficients are estimated by solving a four-step least-squares linear minimization problem, followed by a non-linear refinement based on the maximum likelihood criterion. To validate the proposed technique, and evaluate its performance, we apply the calibration on both simulated and real data.

PSO algorithm is used to solve the formulated problem on two standard test systems, namely the 30-bus and 14-bus systems. Results obtained show that PSO algorithm outperformed most previously proposed algorithms used to solve the same EED problem. These algorithms included evolutionary algorithm, stochastic search technique, linear programming, and adaptive Hopfield neural network. PSO was able to find the Pareto optimal solution set for the multiobjective problem. In addition, PSO results were compared to LINGO software outcomes.

In particular, the ADC must have sufficiently high sampling frequency-typically on the order of several gigasamples per second-to accurately reconstruct the received UWB pulse. An alternative approach to using a single expensive ADC with the above features is to sample the received signal with an array of lower speed ADCs driven by time-interleaved (TI) sampling clocks, allowing the array to operate as if it were a single ADC with a much higher effective sampling frequency. However, ADC timing, gain and offset mismatches represent significant design challenges in such architectures. In this paper, we investigate the use of a pilot-based matched-filter architecture in mitigating the impact of ADC gain, offset, and timing mismatches.

Among these, the log domain belief propagation algorithm (log-BPA or simply BPA) is widely adopted in most of the proposed LDPC decoder architectures. The check node unit (CNU), which computes the check-to-variable (C2V) messages, is computationally the most complex part of the decoder employing the belief propagation algorithm. The BPA can be approximated using a sub-optimal min-sum algorithm; however, it suffers from the performance loss. The min-sum algorithm can be easily implemented with comparators and multiplexers, thereby reducing the area and the power consumption of the decoder, critical for the high data-rate applications such as ultra wide-band (UWB) communications system. Due to the performance degradation, the decoder needs to perform more decoding iterations to reach the desired performance. This, in turn, increases the decoder latency and reduces the decoder throughput. One approach to improve the decoder throughput is to layout more parallel CNUs inside a decoder, but this offsets the advantage of the min-sum implementation. On the other hand, the performance of the min-sum algorithm can be improved by scaling the node-to-check messages and it is possible to find optimal scaling factor for a given channel. In this paper, we propose an improvement to the min-sum algorithm based on the analysis of the error term in the min-sum algorithm. The proposed algorithm achieves the performance similar to the scaled min-sum (SMS) approach with optimal scaling, in the additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel. We also show min-sum utilized with different fading channels and LDPC codes without any further adjustments. Thus, the proposed MMS algorithm provides flexibility in real applications, which need to support multiple code rates, block sizes and have to operate in unknown fading channels. The performance of the proposed algorithm is evaluated for the MB-OFDM UWB systems with short distance indoor channel models. To meet the speed requirement of the of the UWB systems, a bit-level pipelined comparator is developed, which significantly reduces the latency of the critical path in the comparison circuit","doi":"10.1109/ICU.2006.281527","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4059399","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICU.2006.281527","publicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Conference on Ultra-Wideband","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Conference on Ultra-Wideband","pdfPath":"/iel5/4059398/4059399/04059432.pdf","startPage":"125","endPage":"130","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Modified Min-Sum Algorithm for LDPC Decoders in UWB Communications","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"24-27 Sept. 2006","displayDocTitle":"Modified Min-Sum Algorithm for LDPC Decoders in UWB Communications","isConference":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"24-27 Sept. 2006","dateOfInsertion":"15 January 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4059432/","publicationDate":"Sept. 2006","accessionNumber":"9408078","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4059432/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modified Min-Sum Algorithm for LDPC Decoders in UWB Communications","confLoc":"Waltham, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"ICU-00-33.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.091708S","chronDate":"24-27 Sept. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4059398","isNumber":"4059399","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4059398","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"4059399","articleId":"4059432","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4059434,"authors":[{"name":"Nyembezi Nyirongo","affiliation":["Department of Engineering Science, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK"],"firstName":"Nyembezi","lastName":"Nyirongo","id":"38132287400"},{"name":"Wasim Q.

Besides technological challenges, the potential of causing harmful interference to incumbent narrowband (NB) systems is the major obstacle to successful commercialization of UWB communication systems. It is therefore important to accurately investigate the impact of UWB signals on coexisting NB receivers. In this paper, we describe an analytical approach to study the performance of NB binary phase-shift keying (BPSK) receivers in the presence of multiband orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (MB-OFDM) UWB interference. MB-OFDM has recently been adopted by the European Computer Manufacturers Association (ECMA) as physical-layer standard for high-rate short-range data communication. Our analysis includes expressions for the exact and asymptotic bit-error rate (BER) a Gaussian approximation (GA) and an impulsive GA (IGA) of the interference signal, and expressions for the amplitude probability distribution (APD) of MB-OFDM interference. We show that GA and IGA may be used for NB signals with, respectively, much smaller and much larger bandwidths than the MB-OFDM subcarrier spacing. For other signal bandwidths and most NB channel models the exact BER analysis has to be used to obtain meaningful results","doi":"10.1109/ICU.2006.281560","publicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Conference on Ultra-Wideband","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Conference on Ultra-Wideband","pdfPath":"/iel5/4059398/4059399/04059455.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICU.2006.281560","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4059399","startPage":"261","endPage":"267","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Interference from MB-OFDM UWB Systems: Exact, Approximate, and Asymptotic Analysis","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4059455","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Interference from MB-OFDM UWB Systems: Exact, Approximate, and Asymptotic Analysis","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-27 Sept. 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4059455/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"24-27 Sept. 2006","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2006","accessionNumber":"9408101","dateOfInsertion":"15 January 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4059455/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Interference from MB-OFDM UWB Systems: Exact, Approximate, and Asymptotic Analysis","confLoc":"Waltham, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"ICU-00-56.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068504S","chronDate":"24-27 Sept. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4059398","isNumber":"4059399","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4059398","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4059399","articleId":"4059455","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4059456,"authors":[{"name":"Christian R.

Its enormous bandwidth has generated high expectation on the spatial resolution that it could achieve. However, synchronization in the presence of dense multipath is challenging, since the first arrival is not necessarily the strongest one due to channel fading. It is unclear how high a spatial resolution can be realized in practical implementation, and how reliable it will be. We in this paper address practical synchronization algorithms for multiband OFDM UWB transmission, and analyze the performance of a maximum likelihood (ML) joint timing/channel estimation algorithm.

It is necessary to provide low cost receivers for consumers in order to receive wide support for MB-OFDM system. Such receivers can be achieved by utilizing direct conversion architecture. The direct conversion architecture has been investigated for the purpose of cost minimization, miniaturization, and low power consumption of wireless receivers. However, the balance between the in-phase component and the quadrature-phase component of demodulated signals is lost when direct conversion architecture is used. This phenomenon is called IQ imbalance. IQ imbalance is one of the problems for the direct conversion receiver. IQ imbalance causes intercarrier interference (ICI) in the demodulated signals. In this paper, a new scheme of IQ imbalance compensation using transmit diversity is proposed. This scheme enables the system to achieve frequency diversity and compensate the influence of IQ imbalance at the same time. It is shown that the performance of the proposed scheme is better than the conventional IQ imbalance compensation scheme","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Conference on Ultra-Wideband","pdfPath":"/iel5/4059398/4059399/04059460.pdf","startPage":"293","endPage":"298","publicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Conference on Ultra-Wideband","doi":"10.1109/ICU.2006.281565","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICU.2006.281565","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4059399","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4059460","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"IQ Imbalance Compensation Scheme for MB-OFDM with Transmit Diversity","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Receivers","Costs","Frequency diversity","RF signals","Bandwidth","Radio frequency","Baseband","OFDM modulation","Phase shifters","Mixers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["demodulation","diversity reception","intercarrier interference","OFDM modulation","radio receivers","ultra wideband communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["IQ imbalance compensation scheme","multiband orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","MB-OFDM system","diversity transmission","ultrawideband system","UWB","direct conversion architecture","wireless receiver","intercarrier interference","ICI","signal demodulation","frequency diversity"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["UWB","MB-OFDM","Direct Conversion","IQ Imbalance"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4059460/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-27 Sept. 2006","displayDocTitle":"IQ Imbalance Compensation Scheme for MB-OFDM with Transmit Diversity","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4059460/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2006","accessionNumber":"9408106","dateOfInsertion":"15 January 2007","conferenceDate":"24-27 Sept. 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"IQ Imbalance Compensation Scheme for MB-OFDM with Transmit Diversity","confLoc":"Waltham, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"ICU-00-61.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050026S","chronDate":"24-27 Sept. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4059398","isNumber":"4059399","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4059398","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4059399","articleId":"4059460","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":4059470,"authors":[{"name":"Libiao Liu","affiliation":["School of Electrical & Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"firstName":"Libiao","lastName":"Liu","id":"38256488200"},{"name":"Haiping Zhao","affiliation":["School of Electrical & Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"firstName":"Haiping","lastName":"Zhao","id":"38255637400"},{"name":"Terence S.

For a long battery autonomy a low duty cycle operation of the nodes and thus a high peak data rate is essential. Due to the moderate path loss a peak data rate in excess of 50 Mbps would be feasible within the FCC transmit power constraints. With current low complexity PPM detectors, such as the energy detector, the peak data rate is constrained to much lower values, because they are very sensitive to intersymbol interference (ISI). In this paper we constrain our attention to low complexity detectors for UWB PPM, which utilize an observation window of one symbol duration to generate the decision variables for the subsequent symbol decoder. The key contribution is a family of detectors, which utilize partial channel state information (CSI) to improve the robustness to ISI. Specifically we treat the following cases of partial CSI: (i) no CSI, (ii) average power delay profile (APDP), (iii) instantaneous power delay profile (IPDP). To further improve the performance in presence of ISI, a simple post-detection maximum-likelihood sequence estimator (MLSE) is introduced.

In particular, two space-time (ST) coding schemes are proposed. The first one is optimal among all totally-real codes having a constant transmitted energy per antenna. Unlike the classical approach of constructing ST codes over infinite fields, the second construction takes the structure of 2-dimensional constellations into consideration in order to propose an appropriate modulation-specific code.

The applications considered are portable applications for very short communication distances (body area networks, BAN) with bit rates up to 200 Mbps. Therefore, a crucial goal to achieve when designing the LNAs was power dissipation. In order to get very low power consumption, on/off switching technique has been implemented.

In this paper, we use the term non-coherent receiver to denote a system where the phase of the received signal is not used in the detection and synchronization. The performance comparison is based on a simplified analysis of the bit error rate (BER) of different receivers for different modulation types; specifically binary pulse position modulation and binary pulse amplitude modulation. Compared with AC receivers, the ED receiver is significantly lower complexity supporting ease of implementation. An example implementation of one ED receiver architecture is presented. The test circuits of the transceiver are designed for 0.35 mum SiGe BiCMOS technology. The noise figure of the front-end of the ED receiver is 7.3 dB while the receiver gain is 34 dB. The power consumption of UWB-IR transceiver circuits is 136 mW with 100% duty cycle with a 3.3 V power supply","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Transceivers","Pulse modulation","Receivers","Amplitude modulation","Bit error rate","Circuit testing","Ultra wideband technology","Autocorrelation","Infrared detectors","Phase detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["BiCMOS integrated circuits","correlation methods","error statistics","Ge-Si alloys","pulse amplitude modulation","pulse position modulation","radio networks","transceivers","ultra wideband communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["impulse radio receiver","non coherent ultra wideband transceiver architecture","UWB","auto correlation","energy detection receiver","error statistics","binary pulse position modulation","binary pulse amplitude modulation","test circuit","SiGe BiCMOS technology","136 mW","3.3 V","0.35 micron","SiGe"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICU.2006.281597","publicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Conference on Ultra-Wideband","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Conference on Ultra-Wideband","pdfPath":"/iel5/4059398/4059399/04059492.pdf","startPage":"483","endPage":"488","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4059399","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICU.2006.281597","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Impulse Radio based Non-Coherent UWB Transceiver Architectures - An Example","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4059492","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Impulse Radio based Non-Coherent UWB Transceiver Architectures - An Example","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4059492/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2006","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4059492/","accessionNumber":"9408128","conferenceDate":"24-27 Sept. 2006","dateOfInsertion":"15 January 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-27 Sept. 2006","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Impulse Radio based Non-Coherent UWB Transceiver Architectures - An Example","confLoc":"Waltham, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"ICU-00-93.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054928S","chronDate":"24-27 Sept. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4059398","isNumber":"4059399","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4059398","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4059399","articleId":"4059492","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4059493,"authors":[{"name":"A.

Based on this result we obtain an expression for the bit error rate (BER) of a binary phase-shift keying (BPSK) NB signal impaired by DS-UWB and additive white Gaussian noise which lends itself to efficient numerical evaluation. We show that for NB signal bandwidths much smaller than the DS-UWB bandwidth the NB system performance strongly depends on the carrier frequency offset between the NB signal and the DS-UWB signal and we derive corresponding BER approximations.

We assess the interference caused by UWB devices implementing DAA on UMTS, as well as on WiMAX systems, by estimating the time percentage where UWBs interferer with these systems. Both UMTS and WiMAX are supposed to provide primary services with respect to UWB. As a consequence, UWB is not allowed to influence their operations, i.e. no cooperation is assumed between UWB and UMTS, WiMAX devices. In this paper we present and discuss the performances of two DAA techniques, analyzing their dependence on some key UWB transmission parameters, such as the bit rate and emitted power. The proposed DAA procedures are simple to be implemented and their parameters can be selected so to arbitrarily reduce the average percentage of time the UWB interferes with the two considered victim systems","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance Evaluation of Detect and Avoid Procedures for Improving UWB Coexistence with UMTS and WiMAX systems","publicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Conference on Ultra-Wideband","doi":"10.1109/ICU.2006.281600","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Conference on Ultra-Wideband","pdfPath":"/iel5/4059398/4059399/04059495.pdf","startPage":"501","endPage":"506","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICU.2006.281600","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4059399","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4059495","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4059495/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-27 Sept. 2006","displayDocTitle":"Performance Evaluation of Detect and Avoid Procedures for Improving UWB Coexistence with UMTS and WiMAX systems","conferenceDate":"24-27 Sept. 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4059495/","dateOfInsertion":"15 January 2007","publicationDate":"Sept. 2006","accessionNumber":"9408131","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance Evaluation of Detect and Avoid Procedures for Improving UWB Coexistence with UMTS and WiMAX systems","confLoc":"Waltham, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"ICU-00-96.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.08423S","chronDate":"24-27 Sept. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4059398","isNumber":"4059399","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4059398","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"4059399","articleId":"4059495","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4059497,"authors":[{"name":"V.
