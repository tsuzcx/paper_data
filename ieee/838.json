OFDM is the basic building block for multicarrier modulation in most contemporary networks such as vehicular ad hoc networks, Internet of Things (IoT), as well as 4G/5G systems. Most existing OFDM-based security solutions lack the notion of secrecy and dynamicity when combining a secret key with random information extracted from the physical channel. Yet, some solutions perform encryption preinverse fast Fourier transform and some postinverse fast Fourier transform, without clear guidelines concerning the impact on performance and security. In this paper, OFDM-based encryption schemes at the PHY are investigated, analyzed, and weaknesses are identified. It is shown that encryption in the frequency domain slightly mitigates the effects of channel fading and improves the bit error-rate performance. On the other hand, time-domain encryption is shown to be more secure. Furthermore, a dynamic secret key approach that enhances the security level of OFDM-based encryption schemes, in addition to a new technique for updating cipher primitives for input OFDM symbols or frames, are proposed. These schemes are shown to strike a good balance between performance and security robustness as demonstrated through experimental simulations.","doi":"10.1109/JIOT.2018.2846578","publicationTitle":"IEEE Internet of Things Journal","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Internet of Things Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/6488907/8651406/08382157.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JIOT.2018.2846578","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8651406","startPage":"361","endPage":"378","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Efficient OFDM-Based Encryption Scheme Using a Dynamic Key Approach","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8382157","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"An Efficient OFDM-Based Encryption Scheme Using a Dynamic Key Approach","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2019","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8382157/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 June 2018","isJournal":true,"volume":"6","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Feb. 2019","accessionNumber":"18471363","dateOfInsertion":"25 February 2019","htmlLink":"/document/8382157/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100007688","fundingName":"American University of Beirut"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Efficient OFDM-Based Encryption Scheme Using a Dynamic Key Approach","sourcePdf":"jiot-melki-2846578-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.113413S","chronDate":"Feb.  2019","xplore-pub-id":"6488907","isNumber":"8651406","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6488907","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"8651406","articleId":"8382157","onlineDate":"12 June 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8382158,"authors":[{"name":"Prosanta Gope","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, National University of Singapore, Singapore"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6488907/8651406/8382158/gope-2846299-small.gif","p":["Prosanta Gope received the M.Tech. degree in computer science and engineering from the National Institute of Technology Durgapur, Durgapur, India, in 2009, and the Ph.D. degree in computer science and information engineering from National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan, in 2015.","He is currently a Research Fellow with the Department of Computer Science, National University of Singapore, Singapore.

Many IoT devices are deployed in the open and public places, which makes them vulnerable to physical and cloning attacks. Therefore, any authentication protocol designed for IoT devices should be robust even in cases when an IoT device is captured by an adversary. Moreover, many of the IoT devices have limited storage and computational capabilities. Hence, it is desirable that the security solutions for IoT devices should be computationally efficient. To address all these requirements, in this paper, we present a lightweight and privacy-preserving two-factor authentication scheme for IoT devices, where physically uncloneable functions have been considered as one of the authentication factors. Security and performance analysis show that our proposed scheme is not only robust against several attacks, but also very efficient in terms of computational efficiently.","doi":"10.1109/JIOT.2018.2846299","publicationTitle":"IEEE Internet of Things Journal","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Internet of Things Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/6488907/8651406/08382158.pdf","startPage":"580","endPage":"589","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8651406","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JIOT.2018.2846299","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Lightweight and Privacy-Preserving Two-Factor Authentication Scheme for IoT Devices","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8382158","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2019","displayDocTitle":"Lightweight and Privacy-Preserving Two-Factor Authentication Scheme for IoT Devices","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8382158/","publicationDate":"Feb. 2019","dateOfInsertion":"25 February 2019","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"18471395","htmlLink":"/document/8382158/","volume":"6","issue":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 June 2018","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Ministry of Education, Singapore (Tier 1)","grantNumber":"R-263-000-C13-112"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Lightweight and Privacy-Preserving Two-Factor Authentication Scheme for IoT Devices","sourcePdf":"jiot-gope-2846299-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.089684S","chronDate":"Feb.  2019","xplore-pub-id":"6488907","isNumber":"8651406","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6488907","citationCount":"37","xplore-issue":"8651406","articleId":"8382158","onlineDate":"12 June 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8382161,"authors":[{"name":"Hao Liang","affiliation":["College of Communications Engineering, Army Engineering University of PLA, Nanjing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/8274985/8382161/hlian-2845122-small.gif","p":["Hao Liang received the B.S. degree in communication engineering from the College of Communications Engineering, PLA University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, China, in 2015, and the M.S. degree in communications and information system from the College of Communications Engineering, Army Engineering University of PLA (AEUPLA), Nanjing, in 2017,where he is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree in information and communications engineering.","His research interests mainly focus on satellite communication, channel coding, and physical layer security."]},"firstName":"Hao","lastName":"Liang","orcid":"0000-0002-7201-372X","id":"37086149720"},{"name":"Aijun Liu","affiliation":["College of Communications Engineering, Army Engineering University of PLA, Nanjing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/8274985/8382161/liu-2845122-small.gif","p":["Aijun Liu received the B.S. degree in microwave communications, and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in communications engineering and information systems from the College of Communications Engineering, Nanjing, China, in 1990, 1994, and 1997, respectively.

The drivers include increasing demands for ubiquitous, preventive, and personalized healthcare, to be provided to the public at reduced risks and costs. Mobile cloud computing could potentially meet the future healthcare demands by enabling anytime, anywhere capture and analyses of patients' data. However, network latency, bandwidth, and reliability are among the many challenges hindering the realization of next-generation healthcare. This paper proposes a ubiquitous healthcare framework, UbeHealth, that leverages edge computing, deep learning, big data, high-performance computing (HPC), and the Internet of Things (IoT) to address the aforementioned challenges. The framework enables an enhanced network quality of service using its three main components and four layers. Deep learning, big data, and HPC are used to predict network traffic, which in turn are used by the Cloudlet and network layers to optimize data rates, data caching, and routing decisions. Application protocols of the traffic flows are classified, enabling the network layer to meet applications' communication requirements better and to detect malicious traffic and anomalous data. Clustering is used to identify the different kinds of data originating from the same application protocols. A proof of concept UbeHealth system has been developed based on the framework. A detailed literature review is used to capture the design requirements for the proposed system. The system is described in detail including the algorithmic implementation of the three components and four layers. Three widely used data sets are used to evaluate the UbeHealth system.","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2846609","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2846609","startPage":"32258","endPage":"32285","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/8274985/08382164.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8274985","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"UbeHealth: A Personalized Ubiquitous Cloud and Edge-Enabled Networked Healthcare System for Smart Cities","topic":"Big Data Learning and Discovery","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8382164/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2018","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 June 2018","displayDocTitle":"UbeHealth: A Personalized Ubiquitous Cloud and Edge-Enabled Networked Healthcare System for Smart Cities","volume":"6","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"28 June 2018","accessionNumber":"17905698","isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"2018","htmlLink":"/document/8382164/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004054","fundingName":"King Abdulaziz University","grantNumber":"G-661-611-38"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"UbeHealth: A Personalized Ubiquitous Cloud and Edge-Enabled Networked Healthcare System for Smart Cities","sourcePdf":"access-mehmood-2846609-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.217696S","chronDate":"2018","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"8274985","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"24","xplore-issue":"8274985","topics":["Big Data Learning and Discovery"],"articleId":"8382164","onlineDate":"12 June 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8382166,"authors":[{"name":"Qian Mao","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Alabama, Tuscaloosa, AL, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/9739/8540503/8382166/mao-2846401-small.gif","p":["Qian Mao received the B.S. degree from the Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Jiangsu, China, in 2000, the M.E. degree from Shanghai Ship and Shipping Research Institute, Shanghai, China, in 2003, and the Ph.D. degree in traffic information engineering and control from Tongji University, Shanghai, in 2006.

DL uses many neural network layers to achieve a brain-like acute feature extraction from high-dimensional raw data. It can be used to find the network dynamics (such as hotspots, interference distribution, congestion points, traffic bottlenecks, spectrum availability, etc.) based on the analysis of a large amount of network parameters (such as delay, loss rate, link signal-to-noise ratio, etc.). Therefore, DL can analyze extremely complex wireless networks with many nodes and dynamic link quality. This paper performs a comprehensive survey of the applications of DL algorithms for different network layers, including physical layer modulation/coding, data link layer access control/resource allocation, and routing layer path search, and traffic balancing. The use of DL to enhance other network functions, such as network security, sensing data compression, etc., is also discussed. Moreover, the challenging unsolved research issues in this field are discussed in detail, which represent the future research trends of DL-based wireless networks. This paper can help the readers to deeply understand the state-of-the-art of the DL-based wireless network designs, and select interesting unsolved issues to pursue in their research.","doi":"10.1109/COMST.2018.2846401","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Surveys & Tutorials","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Surveys & Tutorials","pdfPath":"/iel7/9739/8540503/08382166.pdf","startPage":"2595","endPage":"2621","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8540503","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/COMST.2018.2846401","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Deep Learning for Intelligent Wireless Networks: A Comprehensive Survey","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8382166","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Fourthquarter  2018","displayDocTitle":"Deep Learning for Intelligent Wireless Networks: A Comprehensive Survey","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8382166/","publicationDate":"Fourthquarter 2018","dateOfInsertion":"20 November 2018","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"18561816","htmlLink":"/document/8382166/","volume":"20","issue":"4","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 June 2018","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Science and Technology Innovation Commission of Shenzhen","grantNumber":"CKFW2016041415372174"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61773197"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Deep Learning for Intelligent Wireless Networks: A Comprehensive Survey","sourcePdf":"comst-hu-2846401-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.243335S","chronDate":"Fourthquarter  2018","xplore-pub-id":"9739","isNumber":"8540503","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9739","citationCount":"159","xplore-issue":"8540503","articleId":"8382166","onlineDate":"12 June 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8382167,"authors":[{"name":"Zhihong Tian","affiliation":["Cyberspace Institute of Advanced Technology, Guangzhou University, Guangzhou, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/8274985/8382167/tian-2846590-small.gif","p":["Zhihong Tian received the Ph.D. degree from the Harbin Institute of Technology.

Cyber range is an adaptable virtualization platform consisting of computers, networks, and systems on which various real-world cyber threat scenarios and systems can be evaluated to provide a comprehensive, unbiased assessment of the security of information and automated control systems. As an important part of features, cyber range must provide the capability of data collection, aggregation, correlation, and replay for the scenario owner or any \u201cspecialized users\u201dto review attacks-defense processes on known targets and future zero-day research. To this end, based on our previous work, the Heetian cyber range, we proposed a method named C2RS meaning \u201ca real-time correlation of host-level events in cyber range service.\u201dC2RS implements out-of-band data capturing for greater attack resistance with virtual machine introspection technique. This approach allows C2RS to isolate the data captured from monitored hosts. C2RS leverages these captured data by incorporating them into the volatility framework to aid in simplifying the analysis of operating system memory structures. Finally, we proposed an object-dependent method to analyze the evidence of illegal activity. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the functions and performance of C2RS in a dynamic service. Through the test, we confirm that the proposed method is effective for real-time correlation of host-level events in cyber range service.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/8274985/08382167.pdf","startPage":"35355","endPage":"35364","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2846590","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2846590","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8274985","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8382167","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Real-Time Correlation of Host-Level Events in Cyber Range Service for Smart Campus","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Virtual machining","Correlation","Security","Forensics","Training","Monitoring","Real-time systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer aided instruction","educational institutions","operating systems (computers)","security of data","virtualisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["smart campus","campus services","real-world cyber threat scenarios","automated control systems","future zero-day research","Heetian cyber range","cyber range service","cybersecurity","C2RS","out-of-band data capturing","adaptable virtualization platform"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Security education","cyber range","network security","correlation","smart campus"]}],"topic":"Novel Learning Applications and Services for Smart Campus","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8382167/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2018","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 June 2018","displayDocTitle":"A Real-Time Correlation of Host-Level Events in Cyber Range Service for Smart Campus","volume":"6","htmlLink":"/document/8382167/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"2018","accessionNumber":"17905868","dateOfInsertion":"16 July 2018","isOpenAccess":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61572153"},{"fundingName":"National Key Research and Development Plan","grantNumber":"2018YFB0803504"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"A Real-Time Correlation of Host-Level Events in Cyber Range Service for Smart Campus","sourcePdf":"access-tian-2846590-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.070527S","chronDate":"2018","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"8274985","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"8274985","topics":["Novel Learning Applications and Services for Smart Campus"],"articleId":"8382167","onlineDate":"12 June 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8382171,"authors":[{"name":"Bin Han","affiliation":["Institute of Wireless Communications, Technische Universit\u00e4t Kaiserslautern, Kaiserslautern, Germany"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/8274985/8382171/han-2846543-small.gif","p":["Bin Han (M\u201915) received the B.E. degree in electronic science and technology from Shanghai Jiao Tong University, China, in 2009, the M.Sc. degree in electrical and information engineering from the Technische Universit\u00e4t Darmstadt, Germany, in 2012, and the Dr. Ing. degree in electrical and information engineering from the Kalsruhe Institute of Technology, Germany, in 2016.

However, it also challenges with an emerging demand for efficient online algorithms to optimize the request-and-decision-based inter-slice resource management strategy. Based on genetic algorithms, this paper presents a novel online optimizer that efficiently approaches toward the ideal slicing strategy with maximized long-term network utility. The proposed method encodes slicing strategies into binary sequences to cope with the request-and-decision mechanism. It requires no a priori knowledge about the traffic/utility models and therefore supports heterogeneous slices while providing solid effectiveness, good robustness against non-stationary service scenarios, and high scalability.","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2846543","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2846543","startPage":"33137","endPage":"33147","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/8274985/08382171.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8274985","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Slice as an Evolutionary Service: Genetic Optimization for Inter-Slice Resource Management in 5G Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8382171/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2018","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 June 2018","displayDocTitle":"Slice as an Evolutionary Service: Genetic Optimization for Inter-Slice Resource Management in 5G Networks","volume":"6","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"04 July 2018","accessionNumber":"17886055","isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"2018","htmlLink":"/document/8382171/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100010661","fundingName":"European Union Horizon-2020 Project 5G-MoNArch","grantNumber":"761445"},{"fundingName":"Network for the Promotion of Young Scientists (TU-Nachwuchsring), Technische Universit\u00e4t Kaiserslautern (individual funding)"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Slice as an Evolutionary Service: Genetic Optimization for Inter-Slice Resource Management in 5G Networks","sourcePdf":"access-han-2846543-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.106815S","chronDate":"2018","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"8274985","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"39","xplore-issue":"8274985","articleId":"8382171","onlineDate":"12 June 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8382172,"authors":[{"name":"Imran Hafeez Abbassi","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, National University of Sciences and Technology, Islamabad, Pakistan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/8274985/8382172/abbas-2846583-small.gif","p":["Imran Hafeez Abbassi received the M.S. degree in information security from the National University of Sciences and Technology, Pakistan, in 2011, where he is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering, with his research focused on hardware intrusion detection using parametric analysis.

The security vulnerability analysis using conventional design time simulations is computationally intensive and incomplete by nature. Formal verification has the potential to overcome these limitations of simulation techniques; however, the existing state-of-the-art formal verification techniques cannot be used as such to analyze the effects of hardware Trojans (HTs) that may impact the performance of the circuit without altering its functionality. In this paper, we propose a novel model checking-based formal framework for a priori assessment of circuit vulnerabilities against both the functional and parametric HTs at the early stages of the design. This framework is characterized by the gate-level side channel parameters, i.e., dynamic power, leakage power, and propagation delay, to examine the impacts of malicious circuitry insertion. An algorithm based on the temporal logic properties is proposed, which computes the bounds for the side channel parameters to define the expected secure regions of circuit operation. Moreover, we propose a second algorithm for formally analyzing the security vulnerabilities in the circuit by introducing partitions, which significantly reduces the size of state space. We evaluate the masking effects on the intrusions while considering 3-sigma variation in the process. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach by analyzing the security vulnerabilities on a set of ISCAS85 and 74\u00d7 benchmarks.","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2846583","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2846583","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/8274985/08382172.pdf","startPage":"32240","endPage":"32257","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8274985","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8382172/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 June 2018","chronOrPublicationDate":"2018","displayDocTitle":"McSeVIC: A Model Checking Based Framework for Security Vulnerability Analysis of Integrated Circuits","volume":"6","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"17905700","htmlLink":"/document/8382172/","dateOfInsertion":"28 June 2018","isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"2018","openAccessFlag":"T","title":"McSeVIC: A Model Checking Based Framework for Security Vulnerability Analysis of Integrated Circuits","sourcePdf":"access-abbasi-2846583-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.122832S","chronDate":"2018","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"8274985","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8274985","articleId":"8382172","onlineDate":"12 June 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8382174,"authors":[{"name":"Ye Liu","affiliation":["Signal Processing and Networks Research Group, Wolfson School of Mechanical, Electrical and Manufacturing Engineering, Loughborough University, Leicestershire, U.K."],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/8536744/8382174/liu-2846574-small.gif","p":["Ye Liu received the B.Eng. degree (Hons.) in electronic and communication engineering and the Ph.D. degree in electronic engineering from the City University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, in 2009 and 2014, respectively.

The mobile network operator (MNO) who owns the infrastructure decides the price per antenna, and a Stackelberg game is formulated for the net profit maximization of the MNO, while the minimum rate requirements of SPs are satisfied. To solve the bi-level optimization problem of the MNO, we first derive the closed-form best responses of the SPs with respect to the pricing strategies of the MNO, such that the problem of the MNO can be reduced to a single-level optimization. Then, via transformations and approximations, we cast the MNO's problem with integer constraints into a signomial geometric program (SGP), and we propose an iterative algorithm based on the successive convex approximation (SCA) to solve the SGP. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm has performance close to the global optimum. Moreover, the interactions between the MNO and SPs in different scenarios are explored via simulations.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2018.2846574","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8536744","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2018.2846574","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/8536744/08382174.pdf","startPage":"5220","endPage":"5234","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Antenna Allocation and Pricing inVirtualized Massive MIMO Networks via Stackelberg Game","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 June 2018","displayDocTitle":"Antenna Allocation and Pricing inVirtualized Massive MIMO Networks via Stackelberg Game","volume":"66","issue":"11","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2018","dateOfInsertion":"06 May 2019","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8382174/","isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2018","accessionNumber":"18247987","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8382174/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000266","fundingName":"Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council","grantNumber":"EP/M015475 and EP/M016005"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Antenna Allocation and Pricing inVirtualized Massive MIMO Networks via Stackelberg Game","sourcePdf":"tcomm-liu-2846574-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.167018S","chronDate":"Nov.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"8536744","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"8536744","articleId":"8382174","onlineDate":"12 June 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8382175,"authors":[{"name":"Shanling Dong","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Industrial Control Technology, Institute of Cyber-Systems and Control, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Shanling","lastName":"Dong","orcid":"0000-0002-1754-1829","id":"37086091620"},{"name":"Zheng-Guang Wu","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Industrial Control Technology, Institute of Cyber-Systems and Control, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Zheng-Guang","lastName":"Wu","orcid":"0000-0003-4460-9785","id":"37404351000"},{"name":"Hongye Su","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Industrial Control Technology, Institute of Cyber-Systems and Control, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Hongye","lastName":"Su","orcid":"0000-0002-7003-1000","id":"37280809400"},{"name":"Peng Shi","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University of Adelaide, Adelaide, SA, Australia"],"firstName":"Peng","lastName":"Shi","orcid":"0000-0001-8218-586X","id":"37287152000"},{"name":"Hamid Reza Karimi","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical Engineering, Politecnico di Milano, Milan, Italy"],"firstName":"Hamid Reza","lastName":"Karimi","orcid":"0000-0001-7629-3266","id":"37287723700"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9286"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2523"},{"format":"CD","value":"2334-3303"}],"articleNumber":"8382175","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":37,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1234},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Control Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieeecss.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8382175","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Markov processes","Hidden Markov models","Closed loop systems","Stability analysis","Nonlinear systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["closed loop systems","continuous time systems","control system synthesis","fuzzy control","hidden Markov models","nonlinear control systems","stability","stochastic systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["closed-loop systems","asynchronous fuzzy controller","strictly dissipative control problem","Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy rules","hidden Markov model","stochastic stability","design techniques","continuous-time nonlinear Markov jump systems subject"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Asynchronous control","fuzzy rules","Markov jump systems","strict dissipativity"]}],"abstract":"This paper addresses the strictly dissipative control problem for continuous-time nonlinear Markov jump systems via Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy rules. The modes of a devised fuzzy controller are assumed to run asynchronously with the modes of original system, which is widespread in practice and described through a hidden Markov model.

However, joint considerations of reliability, temperature, and stochastic characteristics of precedence-constrained tasks for performance optimization make task scheduling particularly challenging. In this paper, we tackle this challenge by using an affinity (i.e., probability)-driven task allocation and scheduling approach that decouples schedule lengths and thermal profiles of processors. Specifically, we separately model the affinity of a task for processors with respect to schedule lengths and the affinity of a task for processors with regard to chip thermal profiles considering task reliability and stochastic characteristics of task execution time and intertask communication time. Subsequently, we combine the two types of affinities, and design a scheduling heuristic that assigns a task to the processor with the highest joint affinity. Extensive simulations based on randomly generated stochastic and real-world applications are performed to validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. Experiment results show that the proposed scheme can reduce the system makespan by up to 30.1% without violating the temperature and reliability constraints compared to benchmarking methods.","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8382180","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Task analysis","Reliability","Program processors","Processor scheduling","Stochastic

Different from existing solutions based on convex optimization, we alternatively propose a cross-entropy (CE)-based algorithm inspired by a sampling approach developed in machine learning. Adopting a probabilistic model, we first reformulate the original problem as a CE minimization problem which aims to learn the probability distribution of variables in the optimal association. An efficient solution by stochastic sampling is introduced to solve the learning problem. The integer constraint is directly handled by the proposed algorithm, which is robust to network deployment and algorithm parameter choices. Simulations verify that the proposed CE approach achieves near-optimal performance quite efficiently.","doi":"10.1109/LWC.2018.2846610","publicationTitle":"IEEE Wireless Communications Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Wireless Communications Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/5962382/8576811/08382184.pdf","startPage":"1014","endPage":"1017","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LWC.2018.2846610","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8576811","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Learning Oriented Cross-Entropy Approach to User Association in Load-Balanced HetNet","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8382184/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 June 2018","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2018","displayDocTitle":"Learning Oriented Cross-Entropy Approach to User Association in Load-Balanced HetNet","volume":"7","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2018","accessionNumber":"18325512","htmlLink":"/document/8382184/","dateOfInsertion":"14 December 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61471114, 61625106, 61571118 and U1534208"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100010014","fundingName":"Six Talent Peaks Project in Jiangsu Province","grantNumber":"GDZB-005"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Learning Oriented Cross-Entropy Approach to User Association in Load-Balanced HetNet","sourcePdf":"lwc-huang-2846610-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.05019S","chronDate":"Dec.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"5962382","isNumber":"8576811","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5962382","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"8576811","articleId":"8382184","onlineDate":"12 June 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Letter","lastupdate":"2021-10-09"},{"_id":8382189,"authors":[{"name":"Shayan Tabatabaei-Nikkhah","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Tehran, Tehran, Iran"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/43/8765487/8382189/tabat-2846625-small.gif","p":["Shayan Tabatabaei-Nikkhah received the M.Sc. degree in electrical engineering from the University of Tehran, Tehran, Iran, in 2018.","His current research interests include approximate computing, electronic design automation, low-power design, hardware/software co-design, and computer architecture."]},"firstName":"Shayan","lastName":"Tabatabaei-Nikkhah","orcid":"0000-0002-1137-0213","id":"37086914919"},{"name":"Mahdi Zahedi","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Tehran, Tehran, Iran"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/43/8765487/8382189/zahed-2846625-small.gif","p":["Mahdi Zahedi received the M.Sc. degree in electrical engineering from the University of Tehran, Tehran, Iran, in 2017.

The proposed framework includes two main parts of Achilles and light-weight predictor selection. The framework leverages light-weight error predictors (i.e., machine learning-based classifiers) to achieve more energy reduction by dynamically managing the output quality level (exact or approximate) of the synthesized circuit. To synthesize the input application, first, we exploit a heuristic algorithm to determine the quality level required for each operation in the data flow graph (DFG) representation of the input application. Next, for synthesizing the input application, we propose an effective Achilles algorithm which utilizes the flexibility of the available multiquality arithmetic units in a high-level cell library to synthesize the datapath. To improve the efficiency, the process starts by iteratively reducing the number of functional units required for synthesizing the DFG. Then, a proper light-weight error predictor satisfying the user expected quality is chosen from the available predictors in the framework. Based on the quality requirements, three different quality management modes are considered. The efficacy of the proposed framework is assessed for benchmarks from image and signal processing as well as robotics domains. The study of these benchmarks indicates that Achilles may reduce the energy consumption up to 51% (36% on average), up to 72% (51% on average), and up to 57% (33% on average) in threshold, average, and hybrid modes, respectively, for the studied cases. Moreover, the results show that relative coverage of large errors may be increased from 21% to 55% by employing synthetic minority oversampling technique method.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8765487","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/43/8765487/08382189.pdf","doi":"10.1109/TCAD.2018.2846625","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCAD.2018.2846625","startPage":"1452","endPage":"1465","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"ACHILLES: Accuracy-Aware High-Level Synthesis Considering Online Quality Management","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 June 2018","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2019","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8382189/","displayDocTitle":"ACHILLES: Accuracy-Aware High-Level Synthesis Considering Online Quality Management","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8382189/","volume":"38","issue":"8","accessionNumber":"18832158","dateOfInsertion":"17 July 2019","publicationDate":"Aug. 2019","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"ACHILLES: Accuracy-Aware High-Level Synthesis Considering Online Quality Management","sourcePdf":"tcad-afzalikusha-2846625-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.221087S","chronDate":"Aug.  2019","xplore-pub-id":"43","isNumber":"8765487","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8765487","articleId":"8382189","onlineDate":"12 June 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8382190,"authors":[{"name":"Jinhyung Lee","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Inter-University Semiconductor Research Center, Seoul National University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Jinhyung","lastName":"Lee","orcid":"0000-0002-0548-3836","id":"37085416101"},{"name":"Kwanseo Park","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Inter-University Semiconductor Research Center, Seoul National University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Kwanseo","lastName":"Park","orcid":"0000-0002-4727-9868","id":"37085401630"},{"name":"Kwangho Lee","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Inter-University Semiconductor Research Center, Seoul National University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Kwangho","lastName":"Lee","id":"37086238146"},{"name":"Deog-Kyoon Jeong","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Inter-University Semiconductor Research Center, Seoul National University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Deog-Kyoon","lastName":"Jeong","orcid":"0000-0003-0436-703X","id":"37274430800"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1549-7747"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-3791"}],"articleNumber":"8382190","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1362},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Circuits and Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieee-cas.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Decision feedback equalizers","Latches","Clocks","Receivers","Next generation networking","Bit error rate","Oscillators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive equalisers","clocks","CMOS integrated circuits","decision feedback equalisers","error statistics","jitter","low-power electronics","receivers","video equipment"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive 2-tap data DFE","adaptive decision-feedback equalizer","bit error rate performance","video cables","differential-pair stage","effective DFE range","minimum data level","direct-feedback DFE architecture","dedicated clock recovery phase","measured BER","peak-to-peak jitter","next generation video interface","1-tap edge DFE","video interface receivers","mismatch offset calibration","circuit techniques","timing constraints","referenceless frequency acquisition","clock recovery phase","RMS jitter","CMOS technology","power 24.4 mW","time 17.5 ps","bit rate 1.62 Gbit/s to 10 Gbit/s","loss 23 dB","time 2.38 ps","size 65 nm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Adaptive equalizer","clock and data recovery (CDR)","decision-feedback equalizer (DFE)","energy efficient","next generation","receiver","referenceless","video interface"]}],"abstract":"This brief presents a 1.62-to-10-Gb/s receiver for next generation video interconnected with an adaptive decision-feedback equalizer (DFE).

The proposed method is based on sparse representation over trained dictionary. Using the proposed K-SVD algorithm to update the dictionary, the image content can be more effectively expressed. Compared with the previous denoising algorithms, the proposed implementation is capable of decomposing the input DoFP image as the optimum sparse combination of the dictionary elements, which are generated by orthogonal matching pursuit. This not only separates the Gaussian noise from the target DoFP image with a significantly elevated peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) but also well-preserves ythe details of the original image. According to our extensive experimental results on various test images, the proposed algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art principal component analysis based denoising algorithm by 3 dB in terms of PSNR. Moreover, visual comparison results, which show excellent agreement with the PSNR results, are presented as well.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Sensors Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/7361/8410048/08382205.pdf","startPage":"6138","endPage":"6144","publicationTitle":"IEEE Sensors Journal","doi":"10.1109/JSEN.2018.2846672","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSEN.2018.2846672","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8410048","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8382205","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A K Times Singular Value Decomposition Based Image Denoising Algorithm for DoFP Polarization Image Sensors With Gaussian Noise","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Dictionaries","Sensors","Noise reduction","Interpolation","Training","Image sensors","Matching pursuit algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Gaussian noise","gradient methods","image denoising","image representation","principal component analysis","singular value decomposition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["sparse representation","trained dictionary","K-SVD algorithm","image content","input DoFP image","optimum sparse combination","dictionary elements","Gaussian noise","elevated peak signal-to-noise ratio","test images","image denoising algorithm","division-of-focal-plane polarization image sensors","polarization image sensors","K times singular value decomposition","principal component analysis","orthogonal matching pursuit","peak signal-to-noise ratio"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Polarization image sensor","division of focal plane","image denoising","singular value decomposition"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8382205/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.1, 1 2018","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 June 2018","displayDocTitle":"A K Times Singular Value Decomposition Based Image Denoising Algorithm for DoFP Polarization Image Sensors With Gaussian Noise","volume":"18","issue":"15","htmlLink":"/document/8382205/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"1 Aug.1, 2018","accessionNumber":"17932680","dateOfInsertion":"11 July 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61504087 and 61504086"},{"fundingName":"Kongque Technology Innovation Foundation of Shenzhen","grantNumber":"KQJSCX20170727101037551"},{"fundingName":"Fundamental Research Foundation of Shenzhen","grantNumber":"JCYJ20160331114526190 and JCYJ20170818101906654"},{"fundingName":"ICT Fund of UAE","grantNumber":"TRA-ICTFund/AURAK/R and D/16/02"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A K Times Singular Value Decomposition Based Image Denoising Algorithm for DoFP Polarization Image Sensors With Gaussian Noise","sourcePdf":"jsen-zhao-2846672-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.091231S","chronDate":"Aug.1, 1 2018","xplore-pub-id":"7361","isNumber":"8410048","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7361","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"8410048","articleId":"8382205","onlineDate":"12 June 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8382206,"authors":[{"name":"Vladimir Herdt","affiliation":["Group of Computer Architecture, University of Bremen, Bremen, Germany"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/43/8738882/8382206/herdt-2846638-small.gif","p":["Vladimir Herdt received the master\u2019s degree in computer science from the University of Bremen, Bremen, Germany, in 2014, where he is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree with the Research Group of Computer Architecture.","His current research interests include verification of systems on high levels of abstraction with a focus on fully automatic formal and simulation-based methods for functional and nonfunctional property checking as well as bug hunting."]},"firstName":"Vladimir","lastName":"Herdt","orcid":"0000-0002-4481-057X","id":"37071425200"},{"name":"Hoang M.

One has to deal with the full complexity of C++ to extract a suitable formal model (front-end problem) and then, with large cyclic state spaces defined by symbolic inputs and concurrent processes. This paper describes a scalable and efficient stateful symbolic simulation approach for SystemC that combines state subsumption reduction (SSR) with partial order reduction (POR) and symbolic execution (SymEx) under the SystemC simulation semantics. While the SymEx+POR combination provides basic capabilities to efficiently explore the state space, SSR prevents revisiting symbolic states and therefore makes the verification complete. The approach has been implemented on top of an intermediate verification language for SystemC to address the front-end problem. The scalability and efficiency of the implemented verifier is demonstrated using an extensive set of experiments.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/43/8738882/08382206.pdf","startPage":"1359","endPage":"1372","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","doi":"10.1109/TCAD.2018.2846638","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCAD.2018.2846638","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8738882","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8382206","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Verifying SystemC Using Intermediate Verification Language and Stateful Symbolic Simulation","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Object oriented modeling","Semantics","Benchmark testing","C++ languages","Space exploration","Scalability","Schedules"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["C++ language","formal verification","programming languages"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["formal verification","front-end problem","state subsumption reduction","SSR","symbolic execution","SystemC simulation semantics","SymEx+POR combination","SystemC designs","formal model","symbolic simulation","verification language","C++","partial order reduction","POR"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Electronic system level (ESL)","formal verification","intermediate verification language (IVL)","partial order reduction (POR)","state subsumption","symbolic execution (SymEx)","symbolic simulation","SystemC"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8382206/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2019","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 June 2018","displayDocTitle":"Verifying SystemC Using Intermediate Verification Language and Stateful Symbolic Simulation","volume":"38","issue":"7","htmlLink":"/document/8382206/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"July 2019","accessionNumber":"18757685","dateOfInsertion":"18 June 2019","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"German Federal Ministry of Education and Research through the Project CONFIRM","grantNumber":"16ES0565"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002347","fundingName":"Bundesministerium f\u00fcr Bildung und Forschung","grantNumber":"01IS13022E"},{"fundingId":"110.13039/501100001659","fundingName":"German Research Foundation through the Reinhart Koselleck Project","grantNumber":"DR 287/23-1"},{"fundingName":"University of Bremen\u2019s Graduate School SyDe"},{"fundingName":"German Excellence Initiative"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Verifying SystemC Using Intermediate Verification Language and Stateful Symbolic Simulation","sourcePdf":"tcad-herdt-2846638-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.119045S","chronDate":"July  2019","xplore-pub-id":"43","isNumber":"8738882","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"8738882","articleId":"8382206","onlineDate":"12 June 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8382208,"authors":[{"name":"Mohamed Ibrahim","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Duke University, Durham, NC, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/43/8738882/8382208/ibrah-2846662-small.gif","p":["Mohamed Ibrahim (S\u201913) received the M.Sc. degree and the Ph.D. degree in electrical and computer engineering from Duke University, Durham, NC, USA, in 2017 and 2018, respectively.","His current research interests include electronic design automation of lab-on-a-chip systems, security and trust of emerging technologies, and artificial intelligence applications of advanced microfluidic systems."]},"firstName":"Mohamed","lastName":"Ibrahim","orcid":"0000-0003-0278-4040","id":"37085494657"},{"name":"Krishnendu Chakrabarty","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Duke University, Durham, NC, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/43/8738882/8382208/chakr-2846662-small.gif","p":["Krishnendu Chakrabarty (F\u201908) received the B.Tech. degree from the Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur, Kharagpur, India, in 1990, and the M.S.E. and Ph.D. degrees from the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA, in 1992 and 1995, respectively.","He is the William H.

Microfluidic solutions have recently been developed to classify cell types or perform single-cell biochemical analysis on preisolated types of cells. However, new techniques are needed to efficiently classify cells and conduct biochemical experiments on multiple cell types concurrently. Nondeterministic cell-type identification, system integration, and design automation are major challenges in this context. To overcome these challenges, we present a hybrid microfluidic platform that enables complete single-cell analysis on a heterogeneous pool of cells. We combine this architecture with an associated design-automation and optimization framework, referred to as co-synthesis (CoSyn). The proposed framework employs real-time resource allocation to coordinate the progression of concurrent cell analysis. Besides this framework, a probabilistic model based on a discrete-time Markov chain is also deployed to investigate protocol settings, where experimental conditions, such as sonication time, vary probabilistically among cell types. Simulation results show that CoSyn efficiently utilizes platform resources and outperforms baseline techniques.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8738882","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/43/8738882/08382208.pdf","doi":"10.1109/TCAD.2018.2846662","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCAD.2018.2846662","startPage":"1237","endPage":"1250","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Synthesis of a Cyberphysical Hybrid Microfluidic Platform for Single-Cell Analysis","chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/43/8738882/8382208-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 June 2018","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2019","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8382208/","displayDocTitle":"Synthesis of a Cyberphysical Hybrid Microfluidic Platform for Single-Cell Analysis","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8382208/","volume":"38","issue":"7","accessionNumber":"18757686","dateOfInsertion":"18 June 2019","publicationDate":"July 2019","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"CCF-1702596 and CCF-1135853"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"CCF-1702596 and CCF-1135853"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100011102","fundingName":"Seventh Framework Programme","grantNumber":"291763"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","chorusFlag":"true","title":"Synthesis of a Cyberphysical Hybrid Microfluidic Platform for Single-Cell Analysis","sourcePdf":"tcad-ibrahim-2846662-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.155259S","chronDate":"July  2019","xplore-pub-id":"43","isNumber":"8738882","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"8738882","articleId":"8382208","onlineDate":"12 June 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8382215,"authors":[{"name":"wenliang zhu","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Information Engineering, Soochow University, Suzhou, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8857/8635319/8382215/liang-2846611-small.gif","p":["Wenliang Zhu is a graduate student of the School of Electronic Information, Soochow University.

A novel method is proposed for accurate recognition and classification of cardiac arrhythmias. Firstly, P-QRS-T waves is segmented from ECG waveform; secondly, morphological features are extracted from P-QRS-T waves, and ECG segment features are extracted from the selected ECG segment by using PCA and dynamic time warping(DTW); finally, SVM is applied to the features and automatic diagnosis results is presented. ECG data set used is derived from the MIT-BIH in which ECG signals are divided into the four classes: normal beats(N), supraventricular ectopic beats (SVEBs), ventricular ectopic beats (VEBs) and fusion of ventricular and normal (F). Our proposed method can distinguish N, SVEBs, VEBs and F with an accuracy of 97.80 percent. The sensitivities for the classes N, SVEBs, VEBs and F are 99.27, 87.47, 94.71, and 73.88 percent and the positive predictivities are 98.48, 95.25, 95.22 and 86.09 percent respectively. The detection sensitivity of SVEBs and VEBs has a better performance by combining proposed features than by using the ECG morphology or ECG segment features separately. The proposed method is compared with four selected peer algorithms and delivers solid results.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8382215/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 June 2018","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.-Feb. 1 2019","volume":"16","issue":"1","accessionNumber":"18434385","pubMedId":"29994263","dateOfInsertion":"05 February 2019","publicationDate":"1 Jan.-Feb. 2019","htmlLink":"/document/8382215/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Arrhythmia Recognition and Classification Using ECG Morphology and Segment Feature Analysis","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Arrhythmia Recognition and Classification Using ECG Morphology and Segment Feature Analysis","sourcePdf":"tcbb-zhu-2846611-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.10766S","chronDate":"Jan.-Feb. 1 2019","xplore-pub-id":"8857","isNumber":"8635319","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8857","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"8635319","articleId":"8382215","onlineDate":"12 June 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8382218,"authors":[{"name":"Nasibeh Teimouri","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Northeastern University, Boston, MA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/43/8738882/8382218/teimo-2846632-small.gif","p":["Nasibeh Teimouri received the B.S. degree in computer engineering from the University of Tehran, Tehran, Iran, 2007 and the M.S. degree in computer architecture from the Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Iran, 2009.

However, ACMPs with many ACCs have scalability limitations. The ACCs' performance benefits can be overshadowed by bottlenecks on shared resources of processor core(s), communication fabric/DMA, and on-chip memory. Primarily, this is rooted in the ACCs' data access and the orchestration dependency. Due to very loosely defined ACC communication semantics, and relying on general architectures, the resources bottlenecks hamper performance. This paper explores and alleviates the scalability limitations of ACMPs. To this end, this paper first proposes ACMPerf, an analytical model to capture the impact of the resources bottlenecks on the achievable ACCs' benefits. Then, this paper identifies and formalizes ACC communication semantics which paves the path toward a more scalable integration of ACCs. The semantics describe four primary aspects: 1) data access; 2) data granularity; 3) data marshalling; and 4) synchronization. Finally, this paper proposes a novel architecture of transparent self-synchronizing accelerators (TSS). TSS efficiently realizes our identified communication semantics of direct ACC-to-ACC connections often occurring in streaming applications. TSS delivers more of the ACCs' benefits than conventional ACMP architectures. Given the same set of ACCs, TSS has up to 130\u00d7 higher throughput and 78\u00d7 lower energy consumption, mainly due to reducing the load on shared architectural resources by 78.3\u00d7.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Computer architecture","Scalability","Synchronization","Acceleration","Fabrics","Process control","Semantics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["embedded systems","microprocessor chips","multiprocessing systems","parallel architectures","power aware computing","synchronisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["alleviating scalability limitation","accelerator-based platforms","accelerator-based chip multiprocessors","application-specific HW accelerators","host processor core","high-performance","power-efficient computing","scalability limitations","shared resources","on-chip memory","ACC communication semantics","general architectures","resources bottlenecks","scalable integration","self-synchronizing accelerators","TSS","identified communication semantics","ACC-to-ACC connections","conventional ACMP architectures","shared architectural resources","ACMP","ACC data access","communication fabric-DMA","ACC performance benefits","ACMPerf"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Accelerator (ACC)","ACC communication overhead","ACC communication semantics","ACC computation coverage","accelerator-based chip multiprocessors (ACMP)","scalability","transparent self-synchronizing accelerators (TSS)"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8382218","doi":"10.1109/TCAD.2018.2846632","startPage":"1317","endPage":"1330","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/43/8738882/08382218.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8738882","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCAD.2018.2846632","chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/43/8738882/8382218-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 June 2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8382218/","displayDocTitle":"Alleviating Scalability Limitation of Accelerator-Based Platforms","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2019","volume":"38","issue":"7","publicationDate":"July 2019","dateOfInsertion":"18 June 2019","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"18757691","htmlLink":"/document/8382218/","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"1319501"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100007297","fundingName":"Office of Naval Research Global","grantNumber":"N00014-17-1-2046"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","chorusFlag":"true","title":"Alleviating Scalability Limitation of Accelerator-Based Platforms","sourcePdf":"tcad-teimouri-2846632-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.097643S","chronDate":"July  2019","xplore-pub-id":"43","isNumber":"8738882","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8738882","articleId":"8382218","onlineDate":"12 June 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8382221,"authors":[{"name":"Mumin Ozpolat","affiliation":["Warwick Manufacturing Group, The University of Warwick, Coventry, U.K."],"firstName":"Mumin","lastName":"Ozpolat","orcid":"0000-0003-4369-0323","id":"37086294432"},{"name":"Erik Kampert","affiliation":["Warwick Manufacturing Group, The University of Warwick, Coventry, U.K."],"firstName":"Erik","lastName":"Kampert","orcid":"0000-0002-7159-8578","id":"37085745481"},{"name":"Paul A.

Systematic assessment of the volume of traffic enables appropriate changes of control measures for directing traffic streams to reach set goals of performance. Video traffic monitoring is a suitable and convenient source of traffic data. The paper presents a method of classification of road traffic conditions based on video surveillance data. Convolutional neural network is used to classify the video content and establish measures of congestion of the observed traffic. Four levels of traffic conditions are distinguished which correspond to LOS categories. The network is validated using video data from several traffic observation sites. The trained CNN is capable of processing video data for systematic use by subsystems of ITS responsible for traffic management. The results of classification are compared with neural network based classifiers: a MLP (multi layer perceptron) and a DLN (deep learning network) with autoencoders.

SANs can provide a promising routing and forwarding paradigm for SIOV by using interest-based communication. Though able to improve the forwarding performance, existing interest-based schemes fail to consider the important issue of protecting users' interest information. In this paper, we propose a privacy-preserving interest-based forwarding scheme (PRIF) for SIOV, which not only protects the interest information but also improves the forwarding performance. We propose a privacy-preserving authentication protocol to recognize communities among mobile nodes. During data routing and forwarding, a node can know others' interests only if they are affiliated with the same community. Moreover, to improve forwarding performance, a new metric community energy is introduced to indicate vehicular social proximity. Community energy is generated when two nodes encounter one another and information is shared among them. PRIF considers this energy metric to select forwarders toward the destination node or the destination community. Security analysis indicates PRIF can protect nodes' interest information. In addition, extensive simulations have been conducted to demonstrate that PRIF outperforms the existing algorithms, including the BEEINFO, Epidemic, and PRoPHET.","doi":"10.1109/JIOT.2018.2846653","publicationTitle":"IEEE Internet of Things Journal","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Internet of Things

performances of low-density parity-check (LDPC)-coded multi-hop free-space optical (FSO) communication system with decode-and-forward strategy over the aggregated double generalized gamma (double GG) fading channels for plane and spherical waves are investigated. In particular, on the basis of the unified closed-from expressions of the composite probability density function and cumulative distribution function in terms of the Meijer's G function, the analytical expression of the ABER for this multi-hop FSO system is derived by generalized Gauss-Laguerre quadrature rule and verified by Monte Carlo simulation. Furthermore, LDPC codes are adopted to improve the system performance. The results show that the ABER performance over double GG distribution is mainly limited by both pointing error and path loss for these two transmission beams, whereas the fading can be significantly improved by LDPC codes, and the coding gain improvement becomes more apparent by decreasing the normalized beam-width, increasing the normalized jitter and hop numbers.

This letter addresses the design of such architectures from an energy efficiency (EE) perspective. We provide closed-form expressions to compare several promising hybrid beamforming architectures, and also derive optimal numbers of antennas required for maximizing the EE. Our results indicate that the asymptotic closed-forms provide a good approximation even for a relatively small number of antennas. Moreover, the combination of phase shifters and switches offers significantly higher EE versus conventional phase shifter-only architectures, while nearly preserving spectral efficiency.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2019","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8382230/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 June 2018","volume":"8","issue":"1","accessionNumber":"18470928","publicationDate":"Feb. 2019","htmlLink":"/document/8382230/","dateOfInsertion":"18 February 2019","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Phase Shifters Versus Switches: An Energy Efficiency Perspective on Hybrid Beamforming","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000266","fundingName":"Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council","grantNumber":"EP/M014126/1"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Phase Shifters Versus Switches: An Energy Efficiency Perspective on Hybrid Beamforming","sourcePdf":"lwc-payami-2846221-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.055289S","chronDate":"Feb.  2019","xplore-pub-id":"5962382","isNumber":"8643663","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5962382","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"8643663","articleId":"8382230","onlineDate":"12 June 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8382234,"authors":[{"name":"Amir Kolaman","affiliation":["Laboratory of Autonomous Robotics, Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, Beer-Sheva, Israel"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/76/8727555/8382234/kolam-2846695-small.gif","p":["Amir Kolaman received the B.Sc. and M.Sc. degrees in electrical and computer engineering from Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, Beersheba, Israel, in 2005 and 2011, respectively, where he is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree with the Laboratory of Autonomous Vehicles, Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Ben-Gurion University of the Negev.

Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) use color components of the input image and, as a result, are sensitive to ambient light conditions. This work analyzes the influence of ambient light conditions on CNN classifiers. We suggest a method for boosting the performance of CNN-based object detection and classification algorithms by using light invariant video imaging (LIVI). LIVI neutralizes the influence of ambient light conditions and renders the perceived object's appearance independent of the light conditions. Training sets consist mainly, if not only, of objects in natural light conditions. As such, using LIVI boosts CNN performance by matching object appearance to that expected by the CNN model, which was created according to the training set. We further investigate the use of LIVI as a general self-supervised learning framework for CNN. Faster region-based CNN (Faster R-CNN) was used as a case study in order to validate the importance of light conditions on CNN performance and on how it can be improved by using LIVI as an input or feedback mechanism in a self-supervised framework. We show that LIVI enables reduced CNN size, enhanced performance and improved training.","doi":"10.1109/TCSVT.2018.2846695","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/76/8727555/08382234.pdf","startPage":"1584","endPage":"1594","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSVT.2018.2846695","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8727555","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8382234","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Light Invariant Video Imaging for Improved Performance of Convolution Neural Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2019","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 June 2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8382234/","displayDocTitle":"Light Invariant Video Imaging for Improved Performance of Convolution Neural Networks","volume":"29","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/8382234/","publicationDate":"June 2019","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"31 May 2019","accessionNumber":"18726064","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Light Invariant Video Imaging for Improved Performance of Convolution Neural Networks","sourcePdf":"tcsvt-kolaman-2846695-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.104615S","chronDate":"June  2019","xplore-pub-id":"76","isNumber":"8727555","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"76","xplore-issue":"8727555","articleId":"8382234","onlineDate":"12 June 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8382237,"authors":[{"name":"Qingfeng Tan","affiliation":["Cyberspace Institute of Advanced Technology, Guangzhou University, Guangzhou, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6488907/8709863/8382237/tan-2846624-small.gif","p":["Qingfeng Tan (M\u201915) received the Ph.D. degree in information security from the University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China, in 2017.","He is currently an Associate Professor with the Cyberspace Institute of Advanced Technology, Guangzhou University, Guangzhou, China.

However, existing Tor HSs use decentralized architecture that makes it easier for an adversary to launch DHT-based attacks. In this paper, we present practical Eclipse attacks on Tor HSs that allow an adversary with an extremely low cost to block arbitrary Tor HSs. We found that the dominant cost of this attack is IP address resources, the experimental results show that we can use only three IP addresses to eclipse an arbitrary HS with 100% success probability. To understand the severity of the Eclipse attack problems on Tor HSs, and its security implications, we present the first formal analysis to evaluate the extent of threat such vulnerabilities may cause and quantify the costs of Eclipse attacks involved in our attack via probabilistic analysis. Theoretical analysis suggests that adversaries with a modest number of IP address resources can block a large number of HSs at any time. Finally, we discuss countermeasures and future works.","doi":"10.1109/JIOT.2018.2846624","publicationTitle":"IEEE Internet of Things Journal","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Internet of Things Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/6488907/8709863/08382237.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JIOT.2018.2846624","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8709863","startPage":"1584","endPage":"1593","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Toward a Comprehensive Insight Into the Eclipse Attacks of Tor Hidden Services","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8382237","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Toward a Comprehensive Insight Into the Eclipse Attacks of Tor Hidden Services","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2019","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8382237/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 June 2018","isJournal":true,"volume":"6","issue":"2","publicationDate":"April 2019","accessionNumber":"18653885","dateOfInsertion":"08 May 2019","htmlLink":"/document/8382237/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61572153"},{"fundingName":"National Key Research and Development Program of China","grantNumber":"2016YFB0801003"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Toward a Comprehensive Insight Into the Eclipse Attacks of Tor Hidden Services","sourcePdf":"jiot-tian-2846624-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.082148S","chronDate":"April  2019","xplore-pub-id":"6488907","isNumber":"8709863","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6488907","citationCount":"25","xplore-issue":"8709863","articleId":"8382237","onlineDate":"12 June 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8382242,"authors":[{"name":"Hailong Huang","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Telecommunications, University of New South Wales, Sydney, NSW, Australia"],"firstName":"Hailong","lastName":"Huang","orcid":"0000-0003-2667-6423","id":"37085839743"},{"name":"Andrey V.

The effectiveness of prognostic diagnosis depends on whether anomalies can be accurately detected before a failure occurs. However, traditional anomaly detection techniques fail to detect \u201coutliers\u201d when the statistical properties of the monitored data change significantly as time proceeds. We describe the design of a changepoint (CP)-based anomaly detector that first detects CPs from collected time-series data, and then utilizes these CPs to detect anomalies. Different CP detection approaches are implemented to detect various types of CPs. A clustering method is then developed to identify normal/abnormal patterns from CP windows. Data collected from a set of commercial core router systems are used to validate the proposed anomaly detector. Experimental results show that our CP-based anomaly detector achieves better performance than traditional methods in terms of two metrics, namely success ratio and nonfalse-alarm ratio.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Changepoint-Based Anomaly Detection for Prognostic Diagnosis in a Core Router System","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","doi":"10.1109/TCAD.2018.2846641","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/43/8738882/08382245.pdf","startPage":"1331","endPage":"1344","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCAD.2018.2846641","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8738882","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8382245","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8382245/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 June 2018","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2019","displayDocTitle":"Changepoint-Based Anomaly Detection for Prognostic Diagnosis in a Core Router System","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"38","issue":"7","htmlLink":"/document/8382245/","dateOfInsertion":"18 June 2019","publicationDate":"July 2019","accessionNumber":"18757694","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003816","fundingName":"Huawei Technologies"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Changepoint-Based Anomaly Detection for Prognostic Diagnosis in a Core Router System","sourcePdf":"tcad-jin-2846641-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.126629S","chronDate":"July  2019","xplore-pub-id":"43","isNumber":"8738882","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"8738882","articleId":"8382245","onlineDate":"12 June 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8382246,"authors":[{"name":"Ali Tajer","affiliation":["Department of Electrical, Computer, and Systems Engineering, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Troy, NY, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Ali Tajer (S\u201905\u2013M\u201910\u2013SM\u201915) received the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from Columbia University, New York City, NY, USA.

Such resource allocation problems have direct applications in data communication networks (e.g., energy harvesting systems). This problem is studied extensively for special choices of the concave utility function (time invariant and logarithmic) in which case the optimal resource allocation policies are well-understood. This paper treats this problem in its general form and analytically characterizes the structure of the optimal resource allocation policy and devises an algorithm for computing the exact solutions analytically. An observation instrumental to devising the provided algorithm is that there exist time instances at which the available resources are exhausted, with no carryover to future. This algorithm identifies all such instances, which in turn, facilitates breaking the original problem into multiple problems with significantly reduced dimensions. Furthermore, some widely used special cases in which the algorithm takes simpler structures are characterized, and the application to the energy harvesting systems is discussed. Numerical evaluations are provided to assess the key properties of the optimal resource allocation structure and to compare the performance with the generic convex optimization algorithms.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2018.2846657","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2018.2846657","startPage":"5608","endPage":"5620","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/8536744/08382246.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8536744","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Resource Allocation Under Sequential Resource Access","chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/26/8536744/8382246-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8382246/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2018","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 June 2018","displayDocTitle":"Resource Allocation Under Sequential Resource Access","volume":"66","issue":"11","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"15 November 2018","accessionNumber":"18231950","publicationDate":"Nov. 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8382246/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"ECCS-1455228 and DMS-1737976"},{"fundingName":"CAREER","grantNumber":"ECCS-1554482"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","chorusFlag":"true","title":"Resource Allocation Under Sequential Resource Access","sourcePdf":"tcomm-tajer-2846657-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.236041S","chronDate":"Nov.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"8536744","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"8536744","articleId":"8382246","onlineDate":"12 June 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8382251,"authors":[{"name":"Yang Yang","affiliation":["Shanghai Institute of Fog Computing Technology (SHIFT), Shanghai, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6488907/8534511/8382251/yang-2846644-small.gif","p":["Yang Yang (S\u201999\u2013M\u201902\u2013SM\u201910\u2013F\u201918) received the B.Eng. and M.Eng. degrees in radio engineering from Southeast University, Nanjing, China, in 1996 and 1999, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree in information engineering from the Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, in 2002.","He is currently a Professor with the School of Information Science and Technology, ShanghaiTech University, China, serving as a Co-Director of the Shanghai Institute of Fog Computing Technology (SHIFT).

It promotes more intelligent applications and services in different Internet of Things (IoT) scenarios, thanks to effective collaborations among neighboring fog nodes via cognitive spectrum access techniques. In this paper, a comprehensive analytical model that considers circuit, computation, offloading energy consumptions is developed for accurately evaluating the overall energy efficiency (EE) in homogeneous fog networks. With this model, the tradeoff relationship between performance gains and energy costs in collaborative task offloading is investigated, thus enabling us to formulate the EE optimization problem for future intelligent IoT applications with practical constraints in available computing resources at helper nodes and unused spectrum in neighboring environments. Based on rigorous mathematical analysis, a maximal energy-efficient task scheduling (MEETS) algorithm is proposed to derive the optimal scheduling decision for a task node and multiple neighboring helper nodes under feasible modulation schemes and time allocations. Extensive simulation results demonstrate the tradeoff relationship between EE and task scheduling performance in homogeneous fog networks. Compared with traditional task scheduling strategies, the proposed MEETS algorithm can achieve much better EE performance under different network parameters and service conditions.","doi":"10.1109/JIOT.2018.2846644","publicationTitle":"IEEE Internet of Things Journal","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Internet of Things Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/6488907/8534511/08382251.pdf","startPage":"4076","endPage":"4087","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8534511","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JIOT.2018.2846644","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"MEETS: Maximal Energy Efficient Task Scheduling in Homogeneous Fog Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8382251","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2018","displayDocTitle":"MEETS: Maximal Energy Efficient Task Scheduling in Homogeneous Fog Networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8382251/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2018","dateOfInsertion":"14 November 2018","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"18582268","htmlLink":"/document/8382251/","volume":"5","issue":"5","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 June 2018","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"STCSM Science and Technology Innovation Program on High-tech","grantNumber":"18511106500"},{"fundingName":"ShanghaiTech University","grantNumber":"F-0203-14-008"},{"fundingName":"Program for Guangdong Introducing Innovative and Enterpreneurial Teams","grantNumber":"2017ZT07X355"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"MEETS: Maximal Energy Efficient Task Scheduling in Homogeneous Fog Networks","sourcePdf":"jiot-yang-2846644-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.104286S","chronDate":"Oct.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"6488907","isNumber":"8534511","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6488907","citationCount":"46","xplore-issue":"8534511","articleId":"8382251","onlineDate":"12 June 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8382253,"authors":[{"name":"Alwin Zulehner","affiliation":["Institute for Integrated Circuits, Johannes Kepler University Linz, Linz, Austria"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/43/8738882/8382253/zuleh-2846658-small.gif","p":["Alwin Zulehner (S\u201917) received the B.Sc. and M.Sc. degrees in computer science from Johannes Kepler University Linz, Linz, Austria, in 2012 and 2015, respectively, where he is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree with the Institute for Integrated Circuits.","His current research interests include design automation for emerging technologies, currently focusing on reversible circuits and quantum circuits.

IBM's project IBM Q can be seen as evidence of this progress. Launched in March 2017 with the goal to provide access to quantum computers for a broad audience, this allowed users to conduct quantum experiments on a 5-qubit and, since June 2017, also on a 16-qubit quantum computer (called IBM QX2 and IBM QX3, respectively). Revised versions of these 5- and 16-qubit quantum computers (named IBM QX4 and IBM QX5, respectively) are available since September 2017. In order to use these, the desired quantum functionality (e.g., provided in terms of a quantum circuit) has to be properly mapped so that the underlying physical constraints are satisfied-a complex task. This demands solutions to automatically and efficiently conduct this mapping process. In this paper, we propose a methodology which addresses this problem, i.e., maps the given quantum functionality to a realization which satisfies all constraints given by the architecture and, at the same time, keeps the overhead in terms of additionally required quantum gates minimal. The proposed methodology is generic, can easily be configured for similar future architectures, and is fully integrated into IBM's SDK. Experimental evaluations show that the proposed approach clearly outperforms IBM's own mapping solution. In fact, for many quantum circuits, the proposed approach determines a mapping to the IBM architecture within minutes, while IBM's solution suffers from long runtimes and runs into a timeout of 1 h in several cases. As an additional benefit, the proposed approach yields mapped circuits with smaller costs (i.e., fewer additional gates are required). All implementations of the proposed methodology are publicly available at http://iic.jku.at/eda/research/ibm_qx_mapping.","doi":"10.1109/TCAD.2018.2846658","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8738882","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCAD.2018.2846658","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/43/8738882/08382253.pdf","startPage":"1226","endPage":"1236","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Efficient Methodology for Mapping Quantum Circuits to the IBM QX Architectures","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 June 2018","displayDocTitle":"An Efficient Methodology for Mapping Quantum Circuits to the IBM QX Architectures","volume":"38","issue":"7","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2019","dateOfInsertion":"18 June 2019","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8382253/","publicationDate":"July 2019","accessionNumber":"18757684","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8382253/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"European Union through the COST Action IC1405"},{"fundingName":"Linz Institute of Technology (CHARON)"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Efficient Methodology for Mapping Quantum Circuits to the IBM QX Architectures","sourcePdf":"tcad-zulehner-2846658-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.133015S","chronDate":"July  2019","xplore-pub-id":"43","isNumber":"8738882","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","citationCount":"32","xplore-issue":"8738882","articleId":"8382253","onlineDate":"12 June 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8382255,"authors":[{"name":"Siew-Kei Lam","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"firstName":"Siew-Kei","lastName":"Lam","orcid":"0000-0002-8346-2635","id":"37085431146"},{"name":"Guiyuan Jiang","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"firstName":"Guiyuan","lastName":"Jiang","orcid":"0000-0002-1398-821X","id":"37086609172"},{"name":"Meiqing Wu","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"firstName":"Meiqing","lastName":"Wu","id":"38468861600"},{"name":"Bin Cao","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"firstName":"Bin","lastName":"Cao","id":"37086443938"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1549-7747"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-3791"}],"articleNumber":"8382255","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":354},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Circuits and Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieee-cas.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Computer architecture","Registers","Streaming media","Detectors","Adders","Delays","Smoothing methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adders","CMOS integrated circuits","feature extraction","field programmable gate arrays","image matching","image resolution"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["area-time efficient streaming architecture","FAST-BRIEF features","BRIEF descriptor","optimized adder tree","smoothing operation","window buffer","BRIEF point-pairs","efficient sampling scheme","register reuse","65-nm CMOS technology","FAST-BRIEF core","area-delay product","FAST detector","features-from-an-accelerated segment test corners","binary robust independent elementary feature descriptor","robust image features","streaming pixels"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Feature descriptor","embedded vision","VLSI","hardware acceleration"]}],"abstract":"The combination of features from an accelerated segment test (FAST) corners and binary robust independent elementary feature (BRIEF) descriptors provide highly robust image features.

For average delay minimization problem with fixed bandwidth allocation, although this problem is nonconvex, the optimal solution is obtained in closed form by comparing all locally optimal solutions calculated from solving the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions. To jointly optimize bandwidth allocation and cache placement, the optimal bandwidth allocation is first derived and then substituted into the original problem. The structure of the optimal caching strategy is presented, which shows that it is optimal to cache the files with high popularity instead of the files with big size. Based on this optimal structure, we propose an iterative algorithm with low complexity to obtain a suboptimal solution, where the closed-from expression is obtained in each step. Numerical results show the superiority of our solution compared with the conventional cache strategy without considering cache and buffer tradeoff in terms of delay.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2018.2846633","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/8536744/08382257.pdf","startPage":"5415","endPage":"5429","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8536744","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2018.2846633","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cache Placement in Two-Tier HetNets With Limited Storage Capacity: Cache or Buffer?","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8382257","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2018","displayDocTitle":"Cache Placement in Two-Tier HetNets With Limited Storage Capacity: Cache or Buffer?","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8382257/","publicationDate":"Nov. 2018","dateOfInsertion":"15 November 2018","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"18248017","htmlLink":"/document/8382257/","volume":"66","issue":"11","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 June 2018","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000266","fundingName":"Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council","grantNumber":"EP/P003486/1, EP/N029666/1 and EP/N029720/1"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61471114, 61372106 and 61701198"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100010014","fundingName":"Six Talent Peaks Project in Jiangsu Province","grantNumber":"GDZB-005"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cache Placement in Two-Tier HetNets With Limited Storage Capacity: Cache or Buffer?","sourcePdf":"tcomm-pan-2846633-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.165729S","chronDate":"Nov.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"8536744","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"8536744","articleId":"8382257","onlineDate":"12 June 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8382258,"authors":[{"name":"Jingchu Liu","affiliation":["Beijing National Research Center for Information Science and Technology, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6488907/8614370/8382258/liu-2846694-small.gif","p":["Jingchu Liu received the B.S. and Ph.D. degrees from the Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, in 2012 and 2017, respectively.","He is currently an Algorithm Engineer with Horizon Robotics, Inc., Beijing.

Previous efforts to design sleeping control algorithms mainly rely on stochastic traffic models and analytical derivation. However, the tractability of models often conflicts with the complexity of real-world traffic, making it difficult to apply in reality. In this paper, we propose a data-driven algorithm for dynamic sleeping control called DeepNap. This algorithm uses a deep Q-network (DQN) to learn effective sleeping policies from high-dimensional raw observations or un-quantized systems state vectors. We propose to enhance the original DQN algorithm with action-wise experience replay and adaptive reward scaling to deal with the challenges in nonstationary traffic. We also provide a model-assisted variant of DeepNap through the Dyna framework for inferring and simulating system dynamics. Periodical traffic modeling makes it possible to capture the nonstationarity in real-world traffic and the incorporation with DQN allows for feature learning and generalization from model outputs. Experiments show that both the end-to-end and the model-assisted version of DeepNap outperform table-based \n<inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"

network (CNN) has become very popular in image classification tasks. With the increasing demand on intelligent classification on battery-powered devices, energy-efficient ASICs for CNN are badly needed. While previous CNN ASIC processors support operations of different kernel sizes, they sacrifice efficiency to support flexible convolution operations. In fact, convolution operations with a certain kernel size are dominating in many real-case CNNs. This brief proposes a kernel-optimized architecture for 3 \u00d7 3 kernels (KOP3), which are dominating operations in mainstream image classification CNNs. Although KOP3 aims at 3 \u00d7 3 kernel operations, it also provides programmability to support arbitrary kernel sizes. KOP3 achieves average energy efficiency of 3.77TOPS/W, which is 4.01\u00d7 better than the best state-of-the-art CNN ASIC processor.","doi":"10.1109/TCSII.2018.2846698","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs","pdfPath":"/iel7/8920/8629296/08382264.pdf","startPage":"277","endPage":"281","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8629296","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSII.2018.2846698","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A 3.77TOPS/W Convolutional Neural Network Processor With Priority-Driven Kernel Optimization","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8382264","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2019","displayDocTitle":"A 3.77TOPS/W Convolutional Neural Network Processor With Priority-Driven Kernel Optimization","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8382264/","publicationDate":"Feb. 2019","dateOfInsertion":"29 January 2019","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"18416849","htmlLink":"/document/8382264/","volume":"66","issue":"2","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 June 2018","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61674094 and 61720106013"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A 3.77TOPS/W Convolutional Neural Network Processor With Priority-Driven Kernel Optimization","sourcePdf":"tcsii-liu-2846698-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.083811S","chronDate":"Feb.  2019","xplore-pub-id":"8920","isNumber":"8629296","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8920","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"8629296","articleId":"8382264","onlineDate":"12 June 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8382270,"authors":[{"name":"Ahoora Bahrami","affiliation":["McMaster University, Hamilton, ON, Canada"],"firstName":"Ahoora","lastName":"Bahrami","id":"37086367409"},{"name":"Mehdi Narimani","affiliation":["McMaster University, Hamilton, ON, Canada"],"firstName":"Mehdi","lastName":"Narimani","orcid":"0000-0003-3399-397X","id":"37851708900"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0885-8993"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0107"}],"articleNumber":"8382270","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":28,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1997},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Power Electronics Society","url":"http://www.ieee-pels.org/"}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Sinusoidal Pulsewidth Modulation (SPWM) Technique for Capacitor Voltage Balancing of a Nested T-Type Four-Level Inverter","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8382270","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Capacitors","Topology","Switches","Inverters","Voltage control","Pulse width modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power capacitors","PWM invertors","voltage control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["control technique","sinusoidal pulsewidth modulation technique","capacitor voltage balancing","sinusoidal pulsewidth modulation scheme","four-level nested neutral-point-clamped inverter","four-level NNPC inverter","high-power medium-voltage applications","simple single-phase modulator","modulation indexes","control method","nested T-type four-level inverter","steady-state condition","transient condition"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Capacitor voltage balancing","multilevel converters","sinusoidal pulsewidth modulation (SPWM)","T-type structure"]}],"abstract":"In this letter, a new control method based on the sinusoidal pulsewidth modulation scheme is proposed to control capacitor voltages of a T-type four-level nested neutral-point-clamped (NNPC) inverter.

Training of CNNs, either from scratch or fine-tuning, requires a large amount of annotated data, where a high quality of annotation is often crucial. In this work, we propose to fine-tune CNNs for image retrieval on a large collection of unordered images in a fully automated manner. Reconstructed 3D models obtained by the state-of-the-art retrieval and structure-from-motion methods guide the selection of the training data. We show that both hard-positive and hard-negative examples, selected by exploiting the geometry and the camera positions available from the 3D models, enhance the performance of particular-object retrieval. CNN descriptor whitening discriminatively learned from the same training data outperforms commonly used PCA whitening. We propose a novel trainable Generalized-Mean (GeM) pooling layer that generalizes max and average pooling and show that it boosts retrieval performance. Applying the proposed method to the VGG network achieves state-of-the-art performance on the standard benchmarks: Oxford Buildings, Paris, and Holidays datasets.","doi":"10.1109/TPAMI.2018.2846566","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8730438","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPAMI.2018.2846566","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel7/34/8730438/08382272.pdf","startPage":"1655","endPage":"1668","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fine-Tuning CNN Image Retrieval with No Human Annotation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 June 2018","displayDocTitle":"Fine-Tuning CNN Image Retrieval with No Human Annotation","volume":"41","issue":"7","chronOrPublicationDate":"July 1 2019","dateOfInsertion":"04 June 2019","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8382272/","publicationDate":"1 July 2019","accessionNumber":"18735923","pubMedId":"29994246","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8382272/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"MSMT","grantNumber":"LL1303 ERC-CZ"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fine-Tuning CNN Image Retrieval with No Human Annotation","sourcePdf":"tpami-radenovic-2846566-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.208422S","chronDate":"July 1 2019","xplore-pub-id":"34","isNumber":"8730438","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"64","xplore-issue":"8730438","articleId":"8382272","onlineDate":"12 June 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8382274,"authors":[{"name":"Bin Li","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Information, Sichuan University, Chengdu, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/8466982/8382274/li-2846556-small.gif","p":["Bin Li (M\u201918\u2013SM\u201918) received the Bachelor's\n degree in automation and the Master's degree in control science and engineering from the Harbin Institute of\n Technology, Harbin, China, in 2005 and 2008, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree in mathematics and statistics from\n Curtin University, Perth, WA, Australia, in 2011.

We consider the time switching (TS) protocol between wireless information and energy transfer. In particular, we propose a more general energy consumption constraint at the source node during the information and energy transfer, which includes the constant power constraints used in existing works as special cases. We study the joint optimization of the source precoding matrices, the relay amplifying matrix, and the TS factor to maximize the source-destination mutual information (MI). The optimal structure of the source and relay matrices is derived, which reduces the original transceiver optimization problem to a simpler power allocation problem. We propose a primal decomposition based algorithm and an upper bound based approach to efficiently solve the power allocation problem. The first algorithm achieves the global optimum, whereas the latter one has a lower computational complexity. Numerical simulations show that both proposed algorithms yield much higher system MI and better rate-energy tradeoff than existing approaches.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/25/8466982/08382274.pdf","startPage":"8348","endPage":"8362","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2018.2846556","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2018.2846556","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8466982","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8382274","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint Transceiver Optimization for Wireless Information and Energy Transfer in Nonregenerative MIMO Relay Systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Relays","MIMO communication","Protocols","Wireless sensor networks","Wireless communication","Receivers","Energy exchange"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","energy harvesting","matrix algebra","MIMO communication","numerical analysis","optimisation","power consumption","precoding","radio transceivers","relay networks (telecommunication)","resource allocation","telecommunication power management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wireless information","energy transfer","nonregenerative MIMO relay systems","source precoding matrices","relay amplifying matrix","source-destination mutual information","relay matrices","multiple-input multiple-output relay system","radio frequency energy harvesting","power allocation problem","energy consumption constraint","transceiver optimization problem","time switching protocol","computational complexity","numerical simulations"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Simultaneous wireless information and energy transfer (SWIET)","energy harvesting","time switching receiver","MIMO relay","nonregenerative relay"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8382274/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2018","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 June 2018","displayDocTitle":"Joint Transceiver Optimization for Wireless Information and Energy Transfer in Nonregenerative MIMO Relay Systems","volume":"67","issue":"9","htmlLink":"/document/8382274/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2018","accessionNumber":"18095064","dateOfInsertion":"17 September 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61701124"},{"fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (China)"},{"fundingName":"Australian Research Council's Discovery Projects","grantNumber":"DP140102131"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint Transceiver Optimization for Wireless Information and Energy Transfer in Nonregenerative MIMO Relay Systems","sourcePdf":"tvt-rong-2846556-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.127817S","chronDate":"Sept.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"8466982","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"8466982","articleId":"8382274","onlineDate":"12 June 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8382280,"authors":[{"name":"Jack Ou","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, California State University Northridge, Northridge, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Jack","lastName":"Ou","orcid":"0000-0002-2262-9067","id":"38490045100"},{"name":"Pietro M.

As the importance of PCG for game development increases, researchers explore new avenues for generating high-quality content with or without human involvement; this paper addresses the relatively new paradigm of using machine learning (in contrast with search-based, solver-based, and constructive methods). We focus on what is most often considered functional game content, such as platformer levels, game maps, interactive fiction stories, and cards in collectible card games, as opposed to cosmetic content, such as sprites and sound effects. In addition to using PCG for autonomous generation, cocreativity, mixed-initiative design, and compression, PCGML is suited for repair, critique, and content analysis because of its focus on modeling existing content. We discuss various data sources and representations that affect the generated content. Multiple PCGML methods are covered, including neural networks: long short-term memory networks, autoencoders, and deep convolutional networks; Markov models: $n$-grams and multi-dimensional Markov chains; clustering; and matrix factorization. Finally, we discuss open problems in PCGML, including learning from small data sets, lack of training data, multilayered learning, style-transfer, parameter tuning, and PCG as a game mechanic.","doi":"10.1109/TG.2018.2846639","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Games","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Games","pdfPath":"/iel7/7782673/8464709/08382283.pdf","startPage":"257","endPage":"270","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TG.2018.2846639","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8464709","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Procedural Content Generation via Machine Learning (PCGML)","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8382283","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 June 2018","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8382283/","displayDocTitle":"Procedural Content Generation via Machine Learning (PCGML)","volume":"10","issue":"3","publicationDate":"Sept. 2018","accessionNumber":"18079774","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8382283/","dateOfInsertion":"13 September 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Procedural Content Generation via Machine Learning (PCGML)","sourcePdf":"tg-togelius-2846639-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.116633S","chronDate":"Sept.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"7782673","isNumber":"8464709","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7782673","citationCount":"31","xplore-issue":"8464709","articleId":"8382283","onlineDate":"12 June 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8382285,"authors":[{"name":"sai vineel reddy chittamuru","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Colorado State University, Fort Collins, CO, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6687315/8630102/8382285/chitt-2846274-small.gif","p":["Sai Vineel Reddy Chittamuru (S'14) received the BTech degree in electrical engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur (IIT-KGP), in 2011, and the PhD degree in electrical and computer engineering, from Colorado State University, Fort Collins, CO, USA, in 2018.

But, the operation of photonic NoCs (PNoCs) is very sensitive to on-chip temperature and process variations. These variations can create significant reliability issues for PNoCs. For example, a microring resonator (MR) may resonate at another wavelength instead of its designated wavelength due to thermal and/or process variations, which can lead to bandwidth wastage and data corruption in PNoCs.

The framework consists of (i) a device-level reactive MR assignment mechanism that dynamically assigns a group of MRs to reliably modulate/receive data in a waveguide based on the chip thermal and process variation characteristics; and (ii) a system-level proactive thread migration technique to avoid on-chip thermal threshold violations and reduce MR tuning/ trimming power by dynamically migrating threads between cores.

A possible solution to guarantee a secure and legitimate transaction is via hiding a piece of tractable information into the multimedia signal, i.e., watermarking. This brief proposes a new multiplicative image watermarking scheme in the contourlet domain by taking into account the local statistical properties and inter-scale dependencies of the contourlet coefficients of images. Although the contourlet coefficients are non-Gaussian within a sub-band, their local distribution fits the Gaussian distribution very well. In addition, it is known that there exist across-scale dependencies among these coefficients. In view of this, we propose the use of bivariate Gaussian (BVG) distribution to model the distribution of the contourlet coefficients. Motivated by the modeling results, an optimum blind watermark decoder is designed in the contourlet domain using the maximum likelihood method. By means of carrying out a number of experiments, the performance of the proposed decoder is investigated with regard to the bit error rate and compared to other decoders. It will be shown that the proposed decoder built upon the BVG model is superior to other decoders in terms of rate of error. It will also be shown that the proposed decoder provides higher robustness in comparison to other decoders in presence of attacks such as filtering, compression, cropping, scaling, and noise.","doi":"10.1109/TCSII.2018.2846547","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs","pdfPath":"/iel7/8920/8584164/08382293.pdf","startPage":"151","endPage":"155","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8584164","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSII.2018.2846547","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Robust Image Watermarking Scheme Using Local Statistical Distribution in the Contourlet Domain","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8382293","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2019","displayDocTitle":"A Robust Image Watermarking Scheme Using Local Statistical Distribution in the Contourlet Domain","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8382293/","publicationDate":"Jan. 2019","dateOfInsertion":"20 December 2018","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"18365171","htmlLink":"/document/8382293/","volume":"66","issue":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 June 2018","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Robust Image Watermarking Scheme Using Local Statistical Distribution in the Contourlet Domain","sourcePdf":"tcsii-sadreazami-2846547-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.059566S","chronDate":"Jan.  2019","xplore-pub-id":"8920","isNumber":"8584164","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8920","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"8584164","articleId":"8382293","onlineDate":"12 June 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8382297,"authors":[{"name":"Angelo Trotta","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Bologna, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8860/8437110/8382297/trott-2839087-small.gif","p":["Angelo Trotta received the Master's degree (summa cum\n laude) in computer science in 2011 and the Ph.D. degree in computer science and engineering in May 2017, both\n from University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy.","From October 2012 to October 2013, he was a Research Student for the Italian PRIN 2009 project STEM-Net working on\n the study, modeling, and simulation of cognitive radio technologies and self-organizing wireless networks.

The three main contributions of our work are as follows. 1) A centralized optimal solution is proposed for the joint problem of UAV positioning for a target coverage ratio and scheduling the charging operations of the UAVs that involves travel to the ground station. 2) A distributed game-theory-based scheduling strategy is proposed using normal-form games with rigorous analysis on performance bounds. Furthermore, a bio-inspired scheme using attractive/repulsive spring actions are used for distributed positioning of the UAVs. 3) The cost-benefit tradeoffs of different levels of cooperation among the UAVs for the distributed charging operations is analyzed. This paper demonstrates that the distributed deployment using only 1-hop messaging achieves approximation of the centrally computed optimum, in terms of coverage and lifetime.","doi":"10.1109/TRO.2018.2839087","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Robotics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Robotics","pdfPath":"/iel7/8860/8437110/08382297.pdf","startPage":"883","endPage":"900","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TRO.2018.2839087","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8437110","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint Coverage, Connectivity, and Charging Strategies for Distributed UAV Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8382297","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 June 2018","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8382297/","displayDocTitle":"Joint Coverage, Connectivity, and Charging Strategies for Distributed UAV Networks","volume":"34","issue":"4","publicationDate":"Aug. 2018","accessionNumber":"18007174","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8382297/","dateOfInsertion":"15 August 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"ALMAIDEA UniBO"},{"fundingName":"BeeDrones: Environmental monitoring systems based on ultralow power sensor nodes and aerial communications"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint Coverage, Connectivity, and Charging Strategies for Distributed UAV Networks","sourcePdf":"tro-trotta-2839087-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.122127S","chronDate":"Aug.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"8860","isNumber":"8437110","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8860","citationCount":"32","xplore-issue":"8437110","articleId":"8382297","onlineDate":"12 June 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":8382301,"authors":[{"name":"Chun Gan","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Advanced Electromagnetic Engineering and Technology, School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/8636215/8382301/gan-2846622-small.gif","p":["Chun Gan (S\u201914\u2013M\u201916) received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in power electronics and motor drives from the China University of Mining and Technology, Jiangsu, China, in 2009 and 2012, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree in power electronics and motor drives from Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China, in 2016.","He is currently a Research Associate with the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of Tennessee, Knoxville, TN, USA.

In the proposed drive, a battery cell and a half-bridge converter is connected as a submodule (SM), and multiple SMs are connected together for the MMC. The modular full-bridge converter is employed to drive the motor. Flexible charging and discharging functions for each SM are obtained by controlling switches in SMs. Multiple working modes and functions are achieved. Compared to conventional and existing SRM drives, there are several advantages for the proposed topology. A lower dc-bus voltage can be flexibly achieved by selecting SM operation states, which can dramatically reduce the voltage stress on the switches. Multilevel phase voltage is obtained to improve the torque capability. Battery state-of-charge balance can be achieved by independently controlling each SM. Flexible fault-tolerance ability for battery cells is equipped. The battery can be flexibly charged under both running and standstill conditions. Furthermore, a completely modular structure is achieved by using standard half-bridge modules, which is beneficial for market mass production. Experiments carried out on a three-phase 12/8 SRM confirm the effectiveness of the proposed SRM drive.","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2018.2846622","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2018.2846622","startPage":"2608","endPage":"2621","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/63/8636215/08382301.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8636215","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"MMC-Based SRM Drives With Decentralized Battery Energy Storage System for Hybrid Electric Vehicles","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8382301/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2019","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 June 2018","displayDocTitle":"MMC-Based SRM Drives With Decentralized Battery Energy Storage System for Hybrid Electric Vehicles","volume":"34","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 February 2019","accessionNumber":"18452345","publicationDate":"March 2019","htmlLink":"/document/8382301/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"MMC-Based SRM Drives With Decentralized Battery Energy Storage System for Hybrid Electric Vehicles","sourcePdf":"tpel-gan-2846622-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.199073S","chronDate":"March  2019","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"8636215","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"35","xplore-issue":"8636215","articleId":"8382301","onlineDate":"12 June 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8382302,"authors":[{"name":"Linzhao Wang","affiliation":["School of Information and Communication Engineering, Dalian University of Technology, Dalian, Ganjingzi, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/34/8730438/8382302/wang-2846598-small.gif","p":["Linzhao Wang received the BE degree from Pingdingshan University, Pingdingshan, China, in 2014.

In this paper, we take one step further by developing a new saliency detection method based on recurrent fully convolutional networks (RFCNs). Compared with existing deep network based methods, the proposed network is able to incorporate saliency prior knowledge for more accurate inference. In addition, the recurrent architecture enables our method to automatically learn to refine the saliency map by iteratively correcting its previous errors, yielding more reliable final predictions. To train such a network with numerous parameters, we propose a pre-training strategy using semantic segmentation data, which simultaneously leverages the strong supervision of segmentation tasks for effective training and enables the network to capture generic representations to characterize category-agnostic objects for saliency detection. Extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that the proposed method compares favorably against state-of-the-art saliency detection approaches. Additional validations are also performed to study the impact of the recurrent architecture and pre-training strategy on both saliency detection and semantic segmentation, which provides important knowledge for network design and training in the future research.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel7/34/8730438/08382302.pdf","startPage":"1734","endPage":"1746","doi":"10.1109/TPAMI.2018.2846598","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPAMI.2018.2846598","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8730438","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Salient Object Detection with Recurrent Fully Convolutional Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8382302/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 June 2018","chronOrPublicationDate":"July 1 2019","displayDocTitle":"Salient Object Detection with Recurrent Fully Convolutional Networks","htmlLink":"/document/8382302/","publicationDate":"1 July 2019","dateOfInsertion":"04 June 2019","accessionNumber":"18735922","pubMedId":"29994247","isJournal":true,"volume":"41","issue":"7","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61725202, 61632006, 91538201 and 61751212"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Salient Object Detection with Recurrent Fully Convolutional Networks","sourcePdf":"tpami-lu-2846598-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.185728S","chronDate":"July 1 2019","xplore-pub-id":"34","isNumber":"8730438","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"26","xplore-issue":"8730438","articleId":"8382302","onlineDate":"12 June 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8382305,"authors":[{"name":"Heecheol Yang","affiliation":["Communications and Machine Learning Laboratory, Seoul National University, Seoul, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/10206/8410643/8382305/yang-2846601-small.gif","p":["Heecheol Yang (S\u201915) received the B.S. degree in electrical and computer engineering from Seoul National University, South Korea, in 2013, where he is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree with the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering.

The achievable recovery threshold, i.e., the number of workers that a master needs to wait for to get the final product, of our proposed scheme is revealed to be order-optimal to the number of workers.

Inspired by this observation, this paper introduces the first fully automated caricature-based face recognition approach capable of working with data acquired in the wild. Our approach leverages the 3D face structure from a single 2D image and compares it with a reference model for obtaining a compact representation of face features deviations. This descriptor is subsequently deformed using a \u201cmeasure locally, weight globally\u201d strategy to resemble the caricature drawing process. The deformed deviations are incorporated in the 3D model using the Laplacian mesh deformation algorithm, and the 2D face caricature image is obtained by projecting the deformed model in the original camera view. To demonstrate the advantages of caricature-based face recognition, we train the VGG-face network from scratch using either original face images (baseline) or caricatured images and use these models for extracting face descriptors from the LFW, IJB-A, and MegaFace data sets. The experiments show an increase in the recognition accuracy when using caricatures rather than original images. Moreover, our approach achieves competitive results with the state-of-the-art face recognition methods, even without explicitly tuning the network for any of the evaluation sets.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security","pdfPath":"/iel7/10206/8410643/08382306.pdf","startPage":"151","endPage":"161","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security","doi":"10.1109/TIFS.2018.2846617","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIFS.2018.2846617","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8410643","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8382306","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"\u201cA Leopard Cannot Change Its Spots\u201d: Improving Face Recognition Using 3D-Based Caricatures","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Face","Face recognition","Three-dimensional displays","Two dimensional displays","Solid modeling","Deformable models","Strain"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cameras","face recognition","feature extraction","image representation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fully automated caricature-based face recognition approach","3D face structure","single 2D image","reference model","compact representation","caricature drawing process","deformed deviations","Laplacian mesh deformation algorithm","2D face caricature image","deformed model","original camera view","VGG-face network","caricatured images","face descriptors","recognition accuracy","3D-based caricatures","face feature deviations","measure locally-weight globally strategy","3D model","face descriptor extraction","MegaFace data sets","IJB-A dataset","LFW dataset"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Face recognition","3D caricature generation","caricature-based face recognition","facial feature analysis"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8382306/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2019","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 June 2018","displayDocTitle":"\u201cA Leopard Cannot Change Its Spots\u201d: Improving Face Recognition Using 3D-Based Caricatures","volume":"14","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/8382306/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2019","accessionNumber":"17932884","dateOfInsertion":"23 July 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001871","fundingName":"Funda\u00e7\u00e3o para a Ci\u00eancia e a Tecnologia","grantNumber":"UID/EEA/50008/2013 and SFRH/BD/92520/2013"},{"fundingName":"FEDER\u2014QREN, Type 4.1, Forma\u00e7\u00e3o Avan\u00e7ada"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004895","fundingName":"European Social Fund"},{"fundingName":"National Funds through the Portuguese Minist\u00e9rio da Educa\u00e7\u00e3o e Ci\u00eancia"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"\u201cA Leopard Cannot Change Its Spots\u201d: Improving Face Recognition Using 3D-Based Caricatures","sourcePdf":"tifs-neves-2846617-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.179785S","chronDate":"Jan.  2019","xplore-pub-id":"10206","isNumber":"8410643","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10206","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"8410643","articleId":"8382306","onlineDate":"12 June 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8382309,"authors":[{"name":"Mohammad Soltanian","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Iran"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6046/8584144/8382309/solta-2844101-small.gif","p":["Mohammad Soltanian received the B.S. and M.S. degrees both from Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Iran, where he is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree, all in electrical engineering.","His research interests include statistical signal processing, image and video modeling and analysis, and machine learning for signal processing."]},"firstName":"Mohammad","lastName":"Soltanian","orcid":"0000-0001-5674-5931","id":"37705135600"},{"name":"Shahrokh Ghaemmaghami","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Electronics Research Institute, Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Iran"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6046/8584144/8382309/ghaem-2844101-small.gif","p":["Shahrokh Ghaemmaghami (M\u201996) received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in electrical engineering from Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Iran, and the Ph.D. degree in signal processing from Queensland University of Technology, Brisbane, QLD, Australia.

Using transfer learning, the image trained descriptors are applied to the video domain to make event recognition feasible in scenarios with limited computational resources. After fine-tuning of the existing CNN concept score extractors, pretrained on ImageNet, the output descriptors of the different fully connected layers are employed as frame descriptors. The resulting descriptors are hierarchically postprocessed and combined with novel and efficient pooling and normalization methods. As major contributions of this paper to the video event recognition, we present a postprocessing scheme in which the hierarchy and the relative shortest distance of concepts in WordNet concept tree is taken into account to alleviate uncertainty of the resulting concept scores at the output of the CNN. Besides, we propose a concept-wise power law normalization method that outperforms the widely used power law normalization. The integration of these approaches results in a high performance average (max) pooling-based video event recognition. Compared to the average (max) pooling combined with the state-of-the-art normalization methods and fine-tuned support vector machine classification, the proposed processing scheme improves the event recognition accuracy in terms of mean average precision over the Columbia consumer video and unstructured social activity attribute datasets, where achieves a pretty comparable result on UCF101 and ActivityNet datasets.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Multimedia","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Multimedia","pdfPath":"/iel7/6046/8584144/08382309.pdf","startPage":"157","endPage":"172","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hierarchical Concept Score Postprocessing and Concept-Wise Normalization in CNN-Based Video Event Recognition","doi":"10.1109/TMM.2018.2844101","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8584144","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMM.2018.2844101","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8382309","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8382309/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 June 2018","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2019","displayDocTitle":"Hierarchical Concept Score Postprocessing and Concept-Wise Normalization in CNN-Based Video Event Recognition","dateOfInsertion":"20 December 2018","publicationDate":"Jan. 2019","accessionNumber":"18329055","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"21","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/8382309/","isJournal":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hierarchical Concept Score Postprocessing and Concept-Wise Normalization in CNN-Based Video Event Recognition","sourcePdf":"tmm-ghaemmaghami-2844101-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.200979S","chronDate":"Jan.  2019","xplore-pub-id":"6046","isNumber":"8584144","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6046","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"8584144","articleId":"8382309","onlineDate":"12 June 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8382310,"authors":[{"name":"Zhijing Qin","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of California at Irvine, Irvine, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/9424/8481610/8382310/qin-2846687-small.gif","p":["Zhijing Qin received the B.S. degree in software engineering from\n Beihang University, Beijing, China, in 2007, the M.S. degree in software engineering from Peking University, Beijing,\n China, in 2009, and the Ph.D. degree in networked systems from the University of California at Irvine, Irvine, CA,\n USA, in 2015.","He is currently a Software Engineer with Google Inc, Mountain View, CA, USA.

Mobile convergecast, as a many-to-one communication pattern, has been recently explored in mobile sensor networks for IIoT, where sensor nodes are usually in mobile status, and report the sensed data regularly or randomly to one or more stationary sinks through the multihop routing path. As convergecast becomes increasingly relevant for industrial sensing and monitoring, a critical part of empowering information aggregation is to maintain consistent transmission. Path duration is one important component of end-to-end delay for communications along the path. In this paper, a probabilistic model for mobile convergecast has been proposed and evaluated to capture path duration times, by considering parameters including network models, sensor network scope, and mobility patterns of network elements. Through experiments, it has been verified that the proposed model can provide a feasible analysis of end-to-end delays in industrial networks implementing convergecast.","doi":"10.1109/TII.2018.2846687","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics","pdfPath":"/iel7/9424/8481610/08382310.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8481610","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TII.2018.2846687","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics","startPage":"4457","endPage":"4467","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Modeling and Analysis of Data Aggregation From Convergecast in Mobile Sensor Networks for Industrial IoT","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8382310","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2018","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 June 2018","displayDocTitle":"Modeling and Analysis of Data Aggregation From Convergecast in Mobile Sensor Networks for Industrial IoT","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8382310/","volume":"14","issue":"10","htmlLink":"/document/8382310/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2018","accessionNumber":"18145564","dateOfInsertion":"04 October 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"Grant 61602168 and Grant 61502162"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modeling and Analysis of Data Aggregation From Convergecast in Mobile Sensor Networks for Industrial IoT","sourcePdf":"tii-wu-2846687-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.103823S","chronDate":"Oct.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"9424","isNumber":"8481610","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9424","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"8481610","articleId":"8382310","onlineDate":"12 June 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8382316,"authors":[{"name":"Nima Safari","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Saskatchewan, Saskatoon, SK, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5165391/8671770/8382316/safar-2846661-small.gif","p":["Nima Safari (S\u201916) received the B.Sc.

In tidal power generation via various tidal energy harvesting technologies, tidal current and level are the most influential factors. This paper addresses a nonparametric prediction interval (NPI)-based uncertainty model thereof. The proposed model adapts a bi-level optimization formulation, based on extreme learning machine (ELM) prediction engine and quantile regression (QR). The quantile probabilities are asymmetrically and adaptively chosen in the upper level optimization to make prediction intervals sharper for a specific reliability level (RL). Besides, the training process of ELM is improved by adaptively selecting ELM's hidden neurons via upper level optimization. The lower level optimization finds ELM's output weighting coefficients through linear programming of QR. The heuristic optimization, consisting of gray wolf optimizer and simplex method, is designed to facilitate the NPI with high exploration and exploitation capabilities in upper level optimization. The performance of the proposed NPI is examined using empirical data recorded in three different sites, located in North America. The results of case studies show that the proposed NPI can provide sharper PIs in comparison to the well-tailored rival models whilst a prespecified RL criterion is met.","doi":"10.1109/TSTE.2018.2846661","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Sustainable Energy","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Sustainable Energy","pdfPath":"/iel7/5165391/8671770/08382316.pdf","startPage":"748","endPage":"758","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSTE.2018.2846661","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8671770","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Tidal Current and Level Uncertainty Prediction via Adaptive Linear Programming","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8382316","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 June 2018","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2019","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8382316/","displayDocTitle":"Tidal Current and Level Uncertainty Prediction via Adaptive Linear Programming","volume":"10","issue":"2","publicationDate":"April 2019","accessionNumber":"18632924","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8382316/","dateOfInsertion":"20 March 2019","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000038","fundingName":"Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada"},{"fundingName":"Saskatchewan Power Corporation"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Tidal Current and Level Uncertainty Prediction via Adaptive Linear Programming","sourcePdf":"tste-safari-2846661-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.105459S","chronDate":"April  2019","xplore-pub-id":"5165391","isNumber":"8671770","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5165391","xplore-issue":"8671770","articleId":"8382316","onlineDate":"12 June 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8382330,"authors":[{"name":"Youjiang Xu","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Technology, Tianjin University, Tianjin, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/83/8396881/8382330/xu-2846664-small.gif","p":["Youjiang Xu received the B.S. and M.S. degrees from Tianjin University in 2015 and 2018, respectively.

In this paper, we develop a novel sequential vector of locally aggregated descriptor (VLAD) layer, named SeqVLAD, to combine a trainable VLAD encoding process and the RCNs architecture into a whole framework. In particular, sequential convolutional feature maps extracted from successive video frames are fed into the RCNs to learn soft spatio-temporal assignment parameters, so as to aggregate not only detailed spatial information in separate video frames but also fine motion information in successive video frames. Moreover, we improve the gated recurrent unit (GRU) of RCNs by sharing the input-to-hidden parameters and propose an improved GRU-RCN architecture named shared GRU-RCN (SGRU-RCN). Thus, our SGRU-RCN has a fewer parameters and a less possibility of overfitting. In experiments, we evaluate SeqVLAD with the tasks of video captioning and video action recognition. Experimental results on Microsoft Research Video Description Corpus, Montreal Video Annotation Dataset, UCF101, and HMDB51 demonstrate the effectiveness and good performance of our method.","doi":"10.1109/TIP.2018.2846664","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/83/8396881/08382330.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIP.2018.2846664","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8396881","startPage":"4933","endPage":"4944","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sequential Video VLAD: Training the Aggregation Locally and Temporally","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8382330","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Sequential Video VLAD: Training the Aggregation Locally and Temporally","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8382330/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 June 2018","isJournal":true,"volume":"27","issue":"10","publicationDate":"Oct. 2018","accessionNumber":"17893091","pubMedId":"29985134","dateOfInsertion":"06 July 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8382330/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"U1509206, 61472276, 61472116, 61722204 and 61429201"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100006606","fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of Tianjin City","grantNumber":"15JCYBJC15400"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000183","fundingName":"Army Research Office","grantNumber":"W911NF-15-1-0290"},{"fundingName":"Faculty Research Gift Awards by the NEC Laboratories of America and Blippar"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sequential Video VLAD: Training the Aggregation Locally and Temporally","sourcePdf":"tip-han-2846664-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.115236S","chronDate":"Oct.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"83","isNumber":"8396881","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"25","xplore-issue":"8396881","articleId":"8382330","onlineDate":"12 June 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8383659,"authors":[{"name":"Rajiv Ranjan","affiliation":["Newcastle University"],"bio":{"p":["Rajiv Ranjan is a Chair Professor of Computing Science and IoT at Newcastle University, UK.

To solve this problem, a Mutual-Encoding InfoGenerative Adversarial Networks (MEIGANs)-based algorithm is proposed in this paper. A mutual-encoding representation learning network is proposed to obtain multi-view representations, i.e., it guarantees through encoders different views of the same object are mapped to the common representation, which carries enough information with respect to the object itself. An InfoGenerative Adversarial Networks-based transformation network is proposed to transform multi-views of the given object, which carries the representation information in the generative models and discriminative models, guaranteeing the synthetic transformed view matches the source view. The advantages of the MEIGAN are that it bypasses direct mappings among different views, and can solve the problem of missing views in training data and the problem of mapping between transformed views and source views. Finally, experiments on incomplete data to complete data restoration tasks on MNIST, CelebA, and multi-view angle transformation tasks on 3-D rendered chairs and multi-view clothing show the proposed algorithm yields satisfactory transformation results.","topic":"Sequential Data Modeling and Its Emerging Applications","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8383683/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 June 2018","chronOrPublicationDate":"2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","publicationDate":"2018","accessionNumber":"18051505","htmlLink":"/document/8383683/","isJournal":true,"isOpenAccess":true,"dateOfInsertion":"28 August 2018","volume":"6","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Multi-View Transformation via Mutual-Encoding InfoGenerative Adversarial Networks","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61402076, 61572104, 61103146 and 61502072"},{"fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities","grantNumber":"DUT17JC04"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004032","fundingName":"Jilin University","grantNumber":"93K172017K03"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Multi-View Transformation via Mutual-Encoding InfoGenerative Adversarial Networks","sourcePdf":"access-sun-2845696-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.118044S","chronDate":"2018","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"8274985","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"8274985","topics":["Sequential Data Modeling and Its Emerging Applications"],"articleId":"8383683","onlineDate":"12 June 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8383689,"authors":[{"name":"Jifang Pei","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/36/8509678/8383689/pei-2838593-small.gif","p":["Jifang Pei (S\u201912) received the B.S. degree from the College of Information Engineering, Xiangtan University, Hunan, China, in 2010, and the M.S. degree from the School of Electronic Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China, in 2013, where he is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree with the School of Information and Communication Engineering.","From 2016 to 2017, he was a joint Ph.D. Student with the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, National University of Singapore, Singapore.

It is desirable to find optimal SAR platform flight paths and acquire a sequence of SAR images from appropriate views, so that multiview SAR ATR can be carried out accurately and efficiently. In this paper, a novel optimization framework for multiview SAR ATR is proposed and implemented. The geometry of the multiview SAR ATR is modeled according to the recognition mission and flight environment. Then, the multiview SAR ATR is abstracted and transformed into a constrained multiobjective optimization problem with objective functions considering the tradeoffs between recognition performance and efficiency and security. A specific approach based on convolutional neural network ensemble and constrained nondominated sorting genetic algorithm II is employed to solve the multiobjective optimization, and optimal flight paths and corresponding imaging viewpoints are obtained.

The mission concept comprises two fully polarimetric radar satellites providing monostatic and bistatic SAR imagery. A key feature of these SAR sensors is the employment of large lightweight unfurlable mesh reflectors fed by digital feed arrays. The main advantage of this new SAR system concept is the provision of large antenna apertures in space and flexible operation via reconfigurable feed electronics. By this, it becomes possible to map, for the first time, a continuous 350-km wide swath with a 7-m azimuth resolution with excellent noise equivalent sigma zero and ambiguity suppression. This paper shall give an overview on the technical aspects of the Tandem-L SAR instrument and antenna design. In particular, after a short review of the SAR system requirements, the concept of reflector SAR systems is outlined and the operation principle is presented. General guidelines for the design of array-fed reflector antennas with application to SAR imaging are given. Then, the optimization approach of the feed array design is detailed with a specific emphasis on a fixed beamforming concept in azimuth. In this context, also the problem of cross-pol pattern mitigation is addressed. These optimization steps are shown to be crucial for achieving the performance requirements in quad-pol acquisitions. Beamforming in elevation is performed onboard the spacecraft via digital hardware. This paper presents the beamforming architecture on receive for Tandem-L, which would apply in general for instance also to planar multielevation beam SAR antennas with Scan-On-Receive capabilities. Tandem-L is operated as a staggered SAR, which means varying the pulse repetition interval from pulse to pulse. In this context, the major design challenges are presented. Moreover, the impact of pulse staggering on the imaging performance is discussed. Tandem-L's SAR performance is presented by means of numerical simulations showing that the performance requirements imposed by the scientific user community could be met.

Nevertheless, applying a deep CNN to no-reference image quality assessment (NR-IQA) remains a challenging task due to critical obstacles, i.e., the lack of a training database. In this paper, we propose a CNN-based NR-IQA framework that can effectively solve this problem. The proposed method-deep image quality assessor (DIQA)-separates the training of NR-IQA into two stages: (1) an objective distortion part and (2) a human visual system-related part. In the first stage, the CNN learns to predict the objective error map, and then the model learns to predict subjective score in the second stage. To complement the inaccuracy of the objective error map prediction on the homogeneous region, we also propose a reliability map. Two simple handcrafted features were additionally employed to further enhance the accuracy. In addition, we propose a way to visualize perceptual error maps to analyze what was learned by the deep CNN model. In the experiments, the DIQA yielded the state-of-the-art accuracy on the various databases.","doi":"10.1109/TNNLS.2018.2829819","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/5962385/8585323/08383698.pdf","startPage":"11","endPage":"24","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8585323","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNNLS.2018.2829819","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Deep CNN-Based Blind Image Quality Predictor","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8383698","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2019","displayDocTitle":"Deep CNN-Based Blind Image Quality Predictor","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8383698/","publicationDate":"Jan. 2019","dateOfInsertion":"21 December 2018","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"18328866","pubMedId":"29994270","htmlLink":"/document/8383698/","volume":"30","issue":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 June 2018","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003725","fundingName":"National Research Foundation of Korea","grantNumber":"2016R1A2B2014525"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Deep CNN-Based Blind Image Quality Predictor","sourcePdf":"tnnls-lee-2829819-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.156322S","chronDate":"Jan.  2019","xplore-pub-id":"5962385","isNumber":"8585323","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5962385","citationCount":"40","xplore-issue":"8585323","articleId":"8383698","onlineDate":"12 June 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8383706,"authors":[{"name":"Yacong Ding","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of California at San Diego, La Jolla, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/8432071/8383706/ding-2843786-small.gif","p":["Yacong Ding (S\u201914) received the B.E. degree in communication engineering from Xiamen University, Xiamen, China, in 2012, and the M.S. degree in electrical engineering from the University of California at San Diego, La Jolla, CA, USA, in 2015, where he is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree with the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering.

By utilizing the sparse recovery and compressive sensing algorithms, we are able to improve the accuracy of the UL/DL channel estimation and reduce the number of UL/DL pilot symbols. Such successful channel estimation builds upon the assumption that the channel can be sparsely represented under some basis/dictionary. Previous works model the channel using some predefined basis/dictionary; while in this paper, we present a dictionary learning-based channel model such that a dictionary is learned from comprehensively collected channel measurements. The learned dictionary adapts specifically to the cell characteristics and promotes a more efficient and robust channel representation, which in turn improves the performance of the channel estimation. Furthermore, we extend the dictionary learning-based channel model into a joint UL/DL learning framework by observing the reciprocity of the angle of arrival/angle of departure between the UL/DL transmissions and propose a joint channel estimation algorithm that combines the UL and DL received training signals to obtain a more accurate channel estimate. In other words, the DL training overhead, which is a bottleneck in FDD massive MIMO system, can be reduced by utilizing the information from simpler UL training.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2018.2843786","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2018.2843786","startPage":"5437","endPage":"5451","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7693/8432071/08383706.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8432071","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dictionary Learning-Based Sparse Channel Representation and Estimation for FDD Massive MIMO Systems","chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/7693/8432071/8383706-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8383706/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2018","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 June 2018","displayDocTitle":"Dictionary Learning-Based Sparse Channel Representation and Estimation for FDD Massive MIMO Systems","volume":"17","issue":"8","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"10 August 2018","accessionNumber":"18007396","publicationDate":"Aug. 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8383706/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"CCF-1617365"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004919","fundingName":"King Abdulaziz City for Science and Technology","grantNumber":"34-988"},{"fundingName":"ONR","grantNumber":"N00014-18-1-2038"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","chorusFlag":"true","title":"Dictionary Learning-Based Sparse Channel Representation and Estimation for FDD Massive MIMO Systems","sourcePdf":"twc-ding-2843786-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.124068S","chronDate":"Aug.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"8432071","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"41","xplore-issue":"8432071","articleId":"8383706","onlineDate":"12 June 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8383707,"authors":[{"name":"Peter H\u00e4ndel","affiliation":["Department of Information Science and Engineering, KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, Sweden"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/8432071/8383707/hande-2843764-small.gif","p":["Peter H\u00e4ndel (S\u201988\u2013M\u201994\u2013SM\u201998) received the M.Sc. degree in engineering physics and the Lic.Eng. and Ph.D. degrees in automatic control from the Department of Technology, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden, in 1987, 1991, and 1993, respectively.

So far, autoencoder-based denoising formulations have learned the model on a separate training data and have used the learned model to denoise test samples. Such a methodology fails when the test image (to denoise) is not of the same kind as the models learned with. This will be the first work, where we learn the autoencoder from the noisy sample while denoising.

We focus on the system performance of hybrid precoding under a more realistic hardware network model, particularly, with inevitable dissipation. The effect of quantized analog and digital precoding is characterized. We investigate the spectral efficiencies of two typical hybrid precoding structures, i.e., the sub-connected structure and the fully connected structure. It is revealed that increasing signal power can compensate for the performance loss incurred by quantized analog precoding. In addition, by capturing the nature of the effective channels for hybrid processing, we employ a channel correlation-based codebook and demonstrate that the codebook shows a great advantage over the conventional random vector quantization codebook. It is also discovered that, if the channel correlation-based codebook is utilized, the sub-connected structure always outperforms the fully connected structure in either massive MIMO or low signal-to-noise ratio scenarios; otherwise, the fully-connected structrue achieves better performance. Simulation results under both Rayleigh fading channels and millimeter wave (mm-wave) channels verify the conclusions above.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7693/8432071/08383712.pdf","startPage":"5465","endPage":"5479","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2018.2844207","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2018.2844207","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8432071","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8383712","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hybrid Precoding Architecture for Massive Multiuser MIMO With Dissipation: Sub-Connected or Fully Connected Structures?","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Precoding","MIMO communication","Radio frequency","Antennas","Complexity theory","Hardware","Phase shifters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["correlation methods","MIMO communication","multiuser channels","precoding","Rayleigh channels","vector quantisation","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Rayleigh fading channels","millimeter wave channels","hybrid precoding architecture","massive multiuser MIMO","feedback channels","massive multiuser multiple-input multiple-output systems","digital precoding","quantized analog precoding","channel correlation-based codebook","conventional random vector quantization codebook","hybrid precoding structures","vector quantization codebook"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Hybrid precoding","massive multiuser multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)","quantized precoding"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8383712/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2018","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 June 2018","displayDocTitle":"Hybrid Precoding Architecture for Massive Multiuser MIMO With Dissipation: Sub-Connected or Fully Connected Structures?","volume":"17","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/8383712/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2018","accessionNumber":"18007358","dateOfInsertion":"10 August 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61521061, 61471114, 61501110 and 61571118"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100010014","fundingName":"Six Talent Peaks Project in Jiangsu Province","grantNumber":"GDZB-005"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004608","fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province","grantNumber":"BK20150635"},{"fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities","grantNumber":"2242014K40037"},{"fundingName":"Open Research Fund of the State Key Lab of ISN","grantNumber":"ISN18-03"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000038","fundingName":"Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada","grantNumber":"261524"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hybrid Precoding Architecture for Massive Multiuser MIMO With Dissipation: Sub-Connected or Fully Connected Structures?","sourcePdf":"twc-du-2844207-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.121496S","chronDate":"Aug.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"8432071","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"32","xplore-issue":"8432071","articleId":"8383712","onlineDate":"12 June 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":8383713,"authors":[{"name":"Eftychia Datsika","affiliation":["IQUADRAT Informatica S.L., Barcelona, Spain"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/8432071/8383713/datsi-2844196-small.gif","p":["Eftychia Datsika (S\u201915) received the B.Sc. and M.Sc. degrees in computer science from the University of Ioannina, Greece, in 2010 and 2012, respectively.

The OTT service providers (OSPs) need to interact with MNOs, requesting resources for serving users of different categories and with different quality-of-service requirements. For this purpose, OSPs need OTT application flow prioritization in resource allocation, while the network resource scheduling should respect network neutrality that forbids OSP prioritization. OSPs also need to request resources periodically, according to their performance goals, i.e., grade-of-service (GoS) level (blocking probability), causing delay in flows' accommodation due to: 1) the time required for information exchange between OSPs and MNOs, affected by network congestion, and 2) the time required for flows to receive resources, affected by the number of concurrently active flows. Acknowledging the lack of OSP-oriented resource management approaches, we: 1) introduce a novel matching theoretic flow prioritization (MTFP) algorithm that respects network neutrality and 2) design analytical models that enable the thorough investigation of the GoS and delay performance in various scenarios. Our results (analytical and simulation) show that MTFP improves both metrics compared to the best effort approach, whereas its performance is affected by the number of flows and the resource allocation frequency.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2018.2844196","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8432071","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2018.2844196","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7693/8432071/08383713.pdf","startPage":"5452","endPage":"5464","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Matching Theory for Over-the-Top Service Provision in 5G Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 June 2018","displayDocTitle":"Matching Theory for Over-the-Top Service Provision in 5G Networks","volume":"17","issue":"8","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2018","dateOfInsertion":"10 August 2018","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8383713/","publicationDate":"Aug. 2018","accessionNumber":"18007384","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8383713/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Research Projects CellFive","grantNumber":"TEC2014-60130-P"},{"fundingName":"SPOT5G","grantNumber":"TEC2017-87456-P"},{"fundingName":"SEMIoTICS","grantNumber":"780315"},{"fundingName":"AGAUR","grantNumber":"2017 SGR 891"},{"fundingName":"DECADE","grantNumber":"H2020-MSCA-2014-RISE: 645705"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Matching Theory for Over-the-Top Service Provision in 5G Networks","sourcePdf":"twc-datsika-2844196-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.153839S","chronDate":"Aug.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"8432071","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"8432071","articleId":"8383713","onlineDate":"12 June 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8383714,"authors":[{"name":"Ziye Zhang","affiliation":["College of Electrical Engineering and Automation, Shandong University of Science and Technology, Qingdao, China","College of Mathematics and Systems Science, Shandong University of Science and Technology, Qingdao, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6221021/9142459/8383714/zhang-2840091-small.gif","p":["Ziye Zhang received the B.Sc. degree in mathematics from Yantai University, Yantai, China, in 2002, the M.Sc. degree in mathematics from Lanzhou University, Lanzhou, China, in 2005, and the Ph.D. degree from the Institute of Complexity Science, Qingdao University, Qingdao, China, in 2015.","She was a Post-Doctoral Fellow with Lakehead University, Thunder Bay, ON, Canada, from 2016 to 2017.

The input signal of the proposed ARVTDNN consists of Cartesian in-phase and quadrature phase ($I/Q$ ) components, as well as envelope-dependent terms.

Its actual performance has been validated through extensive simulations and experiments. The results show that the compensation and hardware impairment mitigation capabilities of the ARVTDNN are superior to the existing state-of-the-art real-valued focused time-delay neural network (RVFTDNN) by 3-4 dB for the adjacent channel power ratio and by 2-3 dB in terms of the normalized mean square error. Other important features of the proposed model are its reduced complexity, in terms of the number of parameters and floating-point operations, and its improved numerical stability compared to the RVFTDNN model.","doi":"10.1109/TNNLS.2018.2838039","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8585323","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNNLS.2018.2838039","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on

IoT and advanced health sensors provide more convenience to patients and physicians. Where physicians can now wirelessly and automatically monitor patient's state. While these medical embedded devices provide a lot of new opportunities to improve the health care system, they also introduce a new set of security risks since they are connected to networks. More importantly, these devices are extremely hardware- and power-constrained, which in turn makes securing these devices more complex. Implementing complex malware detectors or anti-virus on these devices is either very costly or infeasible due to these limitations on power and resources. In this paper, we propose a new framework called SYNDROME for \u201cexternally\u201d monitoring medical embedded devices. Our malware detector uses electromagnetic (EM) signals involuntary generated by the device as it executes a (medical) application in the absence of malware, and analyzes them to build a reference model. It then monitors the EM signals generated by the device during execution and reports an error if there is a statistically significant deviation from the reference model. To evaluate Syndrome, we use open-source software to implement a real-world medical device, called a Syringe Pump, on a variety of well-known embedded/IoT devices including Arduino Uno, FPGA Nios II soft-core, and two Linux IoT mini-computers: OlimexA13 and TS-7250. We also implement a control-flow hijack attack on SyringePump and use Syndrome to detect and stop the attack. Our experimental results show that using Syndrome, we can detect the attack for all the four devices with excellent accuracy (i.e. 0% false positive and 100% true positive) within few milliseconds after the attack starts.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Syndrome: Spectral analysis for anomaly detection on medical IoT and embedded devices","publicationTitle":"2018 IEEE International Symposium on Hardware Oriented Security and Trust (HOST)","doi":"10.1109/HST.2018.8383884","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 IEEE International Symposium on Hardware Oriented Security and Trust (HOST)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8369415/8383882/08383884.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/HST.2018.8383884","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8383882","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8383884","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8383884/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April 30 2018-May 4 2018","displayDocTitle":"Syndrome: Spectral analysis for anomaly detection on medical IoT and embedded devices","conferenceDate":"30 April-4 May 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8383884/","dateOfInsertion":"14 June 2018","publicationDate":"April 2018","accessionNumber":"17843238","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Syndrome: Spectral analysis for anomaly detection on medical IoT and embedded devices","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"RP001003.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.151684S","chronDate":"April 30 2018-May 4 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8369415","isNumber":"8383882","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8369415","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"8383882","articleId":"8383884","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8383889,"authors":[{"name":"Jacob Couch","affiliation":["Johns Hopkins University, Applied Physics Laboratory, Laurel, MD"],"firstName":"Jacob","lastName":"Couch","id":"38237742000"},{"name":"Nicole Whewell","affiliation":["Johns Hopkins University, Applied Physics Laboratory, Laurel, MD"],"firstName":"Nicole","lastName":"Whewell","id":"37086397337"},{"name":"Andrew Monica","affiliation":["Johns Hopkins University, Applied Physics Laboratory, Laurel, MD"],"firstName":"Andrew","lastName":"Monica","id":"37645246500"},{"name":"Stergios Papadakis","affiliation":["Johns Hopkins University, Applied Physics Laboratory, Laurel, MD"],"firstName":"Stergios","lastName":"Papadakis","id":"37955114400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-4731-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-4732-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8383889","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":348},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Field programmable gate arrays","Photonics","Random access memory","Cameras","Transistors","Silicon","Data mining"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","integrated circuit testing","leakage currents","MOSFET circuits","reverse engineering","SRAM chips"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["idle block RAM","integrated circuit","idle SRAM cells","read circuitry","leakage currents flow","NMOS transistors","emitting transistor","SRAM contents","state information","photon emission microscopy","firmware reverse engineering","process node FPGA","encryption keys","size 220.0 nm"]}],"abstract":"In many reverse engineering efforts, side channels have been utilized to extract both design information and data from integrated circuits. In this paper, a technique is demonstrated to recover data by directly reading idle SRAM cells within an FPGA, without engaging the read circuitry. This is accomplished using photon emission microscopy to capture the photons that are emitted as leakage currents flow from the source to the drain of NMOS transistors within the SRAM cell. Depending on whether a 0 or 1 state is stored in a particular cell, the location of the emitting transistor is different. The read circuity in many integrated circuits cannot be easily activated in a repeatable pattern, thus forming need to access the contents of idle SRAM cells. This was evaluated and refined on a 220 nm process node FPGA. We discuss the physics of photon emission in these devices and the consequences for successful imaging of SRAM contents. Through initial investigations and calculations, we predict that extraction of data from idle SRAM can be conducted on more modern parts. Through an extension of this technique, data such as encryption keys, state information, and restricted variables that would not be accessible through traditional bitstream and firmware reverse engineering efforts can be extracted from the integrated circuit. This information can then be utilized to ensure the integrity of a system, or as a threat to the integrity of the system.","doi":"10.1109/HST.2018.8383889","publicationTitle":"2018 IEEE International Symposium on Hardware Oriented Security and Trust (HOST)","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 IEEE International Symposium on Hardware Oriented Security and Trust (HOST)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8369415/8383882/08383889.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/HST.2018.8383889","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8383882","startPage":"41","endPage":"48","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Direct read of idle block RAM from FPGAs utilizing photon emission microscopy","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8383889","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Direct read of idle block RAM from FPGAs utilizing photon emission microscopy","chronOrPublicationDate":"April 30 2018-May 4 2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8383889/","conferenceDate":"30 April-4 May 2018","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2018","accessionNumber":"17856388","dateOfInsertion":"14 June 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8383889/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Direct read of idle block RAM from FPGAs utilizing photon emission microscopy","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"RP006107.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.105607S","chronDate":"April 30 2018-May 4 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8369415","isNumber":"8383882","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8369415","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"8383882","articleId":"8383889","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8383890,"authors":[{"name":"Vincent Immler","affiliation":["Fraunhofer Institute for Applied and Integrated Security (AISEC), Garching near Munich, Germany"],"firstName":"Vincent","lastName":"Immler","id":"37086397431"},{"name":"Johannes Obermaier","affiliation":["Fraunhofer Institute for Applied and Integrated Security (AISEC), Garching near Munich, Germany"],"firstName":"Johannes","lastName":"Obermaier","id":"37086010061"},{"name":"Martin K\u00f6nig","affiliation":["Fraunhofer Research Institution for Microsystems and Solid State Technologies (EMFT), Munich, Germany"],"firstName":"Martin","lastName":"K\u00f6nig","id":"37086396547"},{"name":"Matthias Hiller","affiliation":["Fraunhofer Institute for Applied and Integrated Security (AISEC), Garching near Munich, Germany"],"firstName":"Matthias","lastName":"Hiller","id":"38248194200"},{"name":"Georg Sig","affiliation":["Fraunhofer Institute for Applied and Integrated Security (AISEC), Garching near Munich, Germany"],"firstName":"Georg","lastName":"Sig","id":"37085843247"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-4731-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-4732-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8383890","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":790},"abstract":"Protecting embedded devices against physical attacks is a challenging task since the attacker has control of the device in a hostile environment. To address this issue, current countermeasures typically use a battery-backed tamper-respondent envelope that encloses the entire device to create a trusted compartment. However, the battery affects the system's robustness and weight, and also leads to difficulties with the security mechanism while shipping the device. In contrast, we present a batteryless tamper-resistant envelope, which contains a fine mesh of electrodes, and its complementary security concept. An evaluation unit checks the integrity of the sensor mesh by detecting short and open circuits. Additionally, it measures the capacitances of the mesh. Once its preliminary integrity is confirmed, a cryptographic key is derived from the capacitive measurements that represent a PUF, to decrypt and authenticate the firmware of the enclosed host system. We demonstrate the feasibility of our concept, provide details on the layout and electrical properties of the batteryless envelope, and explain the underlying security architecture.

Use of counterfeit or reused components not only impacts profit but also has a detrimental impact on several critical applications including aerospace, medical, and defense. To worsen the situation the number of counterfeiting components has increased considerably after the introduction of horizontal semiconductor supply chain. In this paper, we will focus on detecting recycled Flash memory, a major target of the counterfeiters because of its presence in the most electronic systems. Failure of the Flash memory in critical applications can have catastrophic effects. Detection of recycled Flash with high confidence i s challenging due to the variability among the different Flash chips caused by process variations. There is very few work on detecting recycled memory chips, and unfortunately, all of them require an extensive database to maintain which is impossible for several electronic systems. In this paper, we propose a new method for detecting fake Flash memory without the need for any prior database. Our method is based on statistical distribution of various Flash timing characteristics such as erase, program and read time on a fresh Flash IC. It has been found that timing characteristics are highly sensitive to memory usage (typically quantified as the program-erase count of a memory block) compared to the process variations. We demonstrate our method by characterizing the block to block timing variation on commercial off the shelf Flash ICs and compared it with the recycled or used one. Our method can identify a recycled IC of minimal usage (~3.0%) with nearly 100% accuracy without requiring any prior database.","doi":"10.1109/HST.2018.8383895","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8383882","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/HST.2018.8383895","publicationTitle":"2018 IEEE International Symposium on Hardware Oriented Security and Trust (HOST)","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 IEEE International Symposium on Hardware Oriented Security and Trust (HOST)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8369415/8383882/08383895.pdf","startPage":"89","endPage":"95","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Independent detection of recycled flash memory: Challenges and solutions","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"30 April-4 May 2018","displayDocTitle":"Independent detection of recycled flash memory: Challenges and solutions","isConference":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"April 30 2018-May 4 2018","dateOfInsertion":"14 June 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8383895/","publicationDate":"April 2018","accessionNumber":"17843252","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8383895/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Independent detection of recycled flash memory: Challenges and solutions","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"RP012039.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.087149S","chronDate":"April 30 2018-May 4 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8369415","isNumber":"8383882","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8369415","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"8383882","articleId":"8383895","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8383900,"authors":[{"name":"Robert Hesselbarth","affiliation":["Fraunhofer Institute for Applied and Integrated Security (AISEC), Munich, Germany"],"firstName":"Robert","lastName":"Hesselbarth","id":"37085889112"},{"name":"Florian Wilde","affiliation":["Technical University of Munich (TUM), Munich, Germany"],"firstName":"Florian","lastName":"Wilde","id":"37085469550"},{"name":"Chongyan Gu","affiliation":["Center for Secure Information Technologies (CSIT), Queen's University Belfast, Belfast, UK"],"firstName":"Chongyan","lastName":"Gu","id":"37085406753"},{"name":"Neil Hanley","affiliation":["Center for Secure Information Technologies (CSIT), Queen's University Belfast, Belfast, UK"],"firstName":"Neil","lastName":"Hanley","id":"37590805600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-4731-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-4732-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8383900","dbTime":"23 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":11,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":710},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Field programmable gate arrays","Temperature measurement","Routing","Arrays","Switches","Clocks","Frequency measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["clocks","field programmable gate arrays","logic design","oscillators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["PUF analysis","secure secret storage","physical unclonable functions","programmable logic fabric","field programmable gate arrays","time-to-response","ring oscillator PUFs","RO-PUFs","FPGA array","Xilinx FPGAs","temperature 60.0 degC","temperature 100.0 degC","size 28.0 nm"]}],"abstract":"Runtime accessible, general purpose, secure secret storage based on physical unclonable functions (PUFs) implemented within the programmable logic fabric is one of the most interesting applications of PUFs on field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs). To properly evaluate the quality of a PUF design, data from a large number of devices is required. This work therefore publishes a dataset containing 100 repeated measurements of 6592 ring oscillators (ROs) on 217 Xilinx Artix-7 XC7A35T FPGAs. This is both larger, and based on a more recent technology node than other publicly available datasets of related work. Apart from making the raw data publicly available, a thorough analysis is performed. The location and type of slice is found to affect the RO frequency by approx. 5 MHz, fast switching logic decreases the frequency by approx. 10MHz, and ROs adjacent to clock routing resources showed an expected frequency of 20 MHz less than others on the device. We also address the time-to-response of ring oscillator PUFs (RO-PUFs), which can be large, by optimizing the evaluation time with regard to the measurement precision and found 70.71 \u03bcs to be optimal for the device and architecture under test. The temperature induced bit error rate was estimated to be 3.5 % and 5.8 % for temperature differences of 60 \u00b0C and 100 \u00b0C respectively.

In this work, we investigate new security threats from malicious FPGA tools, and identify stealthy attacks that could occur during FPGA deployment. To address those attacks, we exploit the principles of moving target defense (MTD) and propose a FPGA-oriented MTD (FOMTD) method. Our method is composed of three defense lines, which are formed by an improved user constraint file, random selection of design replicas, and runtime submodule assembling, respectively. The FPGA emulation results show that the proposed FOMTD method reduces the hardware Trojan hit rate by 60% over the baseline, at the cost of 10.76% more power consumption.","doi":"10.1109/HST.2018.8383907","publicationTitle":"2018 IEEE International Symposium on Hardware Oriented Security and Trust (HOST)","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 IEEE International Symposium on Hardware Oriented Security and Trust (HOST)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8369415/8383882/08383907.pdf","startPage":"163","endPage":"166","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/HST.2018.8383907","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8383882","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"FPGA-oriented moving target defense against security threats from malicious FPGA tools","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"30 April-4 May 2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8383907/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April 30 2018-May 4 2018","displayDocTitle":"FPGA-oriented moving target defense against security threats from malicious FPGA tools","dateOfInsertion":"14 June 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8383907/","accessionNumber":"17843249","publicationDate":"April 2018","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FPGA-oriented moving target defense against security threats from malicious FPGA tools","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"RP024065.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.14426S","chronDate":"April 30 2018-May 4 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8369415","isNumber":"8383882","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8369415","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"8383882","articleId":"8383907","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8383910,"authors":[{"name":"Patrick Cronin","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Delaware"],"firstName":"Patrick","lastName":"Cronin","id":"37427806000"},{"name":"Chengmo Yang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Delaware"],"firstName":"Chengmo","lastName":"Yang","id":"37597788000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-4731-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-4732-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8383910","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":200},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multicore processing","Smart phones","Neural networks","Hardware","Trojan horses"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["invasive software","mobile computing","neural nets","pattern classification","sampling methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["background detection","low frequency sampling","mobile phones","malware creators","mobile platforms","Hardware Performance Counters","battery constrained mobile devices","system-wide sampling rates","HPCs","online malware detection","zero-day attacks","Motorola G4 platform","classifiers","multi-layer neural network"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Hardware Performance Counter","Mobile","Malware"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8383910","abstract":"As mobile phones become more ubiquitous in our daily lives, many malware creators have shifted their focus to these mobile platforms. While a plethora of work exists to try and detect malware as it is uploaded to app stores and when it is downloaded to user devices, malware still slips through. A lesser body of work has suggested that Hardware Performance Counters (HPCs) can provide an insight into detecting malware as it runs. While these works have been successful, they typically require thread-level sampling rates every tens of thousands of instructions and hundreds of KB/s to MB/s of bus bandwidth, resulting in high power overhead in battery constrained mobile devices. Unlike previous works, this paper proposes a coarser grained approach, requiring system-wide sampling rates in the hundreds of Hz and less than 10 KB/s of bandwidth, all while achieving similar accuracy to previous works and identification of zero-day attacks. The proposed method focuses purely on background detection, that is, detection of malware when its parent application is inactive. This technique relies upon a multi-layer neural network to extract the higher order dependencies between different HPCs as processes are executed on multiple cores. Experiments are conducted on a Motorola G4 platform, and classifiers are trained with multiple families of malware and a multitude of clean system states.","doi":"10.1109/HST.2018.8383910","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/HST.2018.8383910","startPage":"177","endPage":"180","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 IEEE International Symposium on Hardware Oriented Security and Trust (HOST)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8369415/8383882/08383910.pdf","publicationTitle":"2018 IEEE International Symposium on Hardware Oriented Security and Trust (HOST)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8383882","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Lowering the barrier to online malware detection through low frequency sampling of HPCs","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"April 30 2018-May 4 2018","displayDocTitle":"Lowering the barrier to online malware detection through low frequency sampling of HPCs","conferenceDate":"30 April-4 May 2018","publicationDate":"April 2018","dateOfInsertion":"14 June 2018","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8383910/","accessionNumber":"17843237","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8383910/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Lowering the barrier to online malware detection through low frequency sampling of HPCs","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"RP027028.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044203S","chronDate":"April 30 2018-May 4 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8369415","isNumber":"8383882","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8369415","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8383882","articleId":"8383910","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-12"},{"_id":8383914,"authors":[{"name":"Yumin Hou","affiliation":["Institute of Microelectronics, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yumin","lastName":"Hou","id":"37086398809"},{"name":"Hu He","affiliation":["Institute of Microelectronics, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Hu","lastName":"He","id":"37086398158"},{"name":"Kaveh Shamsi","affiliation":["Institute of Microelectronics, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Kaveh","lastName":"Shamsi","id":"37085639068"},{"name":"Yier Jin","affiliation":["Institute of Microelectronics, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yier","lastName":"Jin","id":"37402122400"},{"name":"Dong Wu","affiliation":["Institute of Microelectronics, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Dong","lastName":"Wu","id":"37085362129"},{"name":"Huaqiang Wu","affiliation":["Institute of Microelectronics, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Huaqiang","lastName":"Wu","id":"37085869565"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-4731-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-4732-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8383914","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":10,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":519},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Trojan horses","Hardware","Registers","Security","Monitoring","Runtime"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["semiconductor industry"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["analog Trojan","R2D2","A2 Trojan","semiconductor industry","hardware security issues","hardware security threats","current Trojan detection solutions","runtime hardware Trojan detection method","advanced Trojans","hardware interrupt request","ARMv7-A&R ISA"]}],"abstract":"With the globalization of semiconductor industry, hardware security issues have been gaining increasing attention. Among all hardware security threats, the insertion of hardware Trojans is one of the main concerns. Meanwhile, many current Trojan detection solutions follow the assumption that the hardware Trojan itself should be composed of digital logic. This assumption is invalidated by recently proposed analog Trojans which are extremely small and can detect rare events. This paper proposes a runtime hardware Trojan detection method which is geared towards detecting such advanced Trojans. The principle of this method is to guard a set of concerned signals, and initiate a hardware interrupt request when abnormal toggling events occur in these guarded signals. To prove the effectiveness of this method, we design a processor based on ARMv7-A&R ISA, and insert an analog Trojan into the processor. We fabricated the design in the SMIC 130 nm process and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"R2D2: Runtime reassurance and detection of A2 Trojan","publicationTitle":"2018 IEEE International Symposium on Hardware Oriented Security and Trust (HOST)","doi":"10.1109/HST.2018.8383914","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 IEEE International Symposium on Hardware Oriented Security and Trust (HOST)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8369415/8383882/08383914.pdf","startPage":"195","endPage":"200","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/HST.2018.8383914","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8383882","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8383914","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8383914/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April 30 2018-May 4 2018","displayDocTitle":"R2D2: Runtime reassurance and detection of A2 Trojan","conferenceDate":"30 April-4 May 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8383914/","dateOfInsertion":"14 June 2018","publicationDate":"April 2018","accessionNumber":"17843254","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"R2D2: Runtime reassurance and detection of A2 Trojan","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"RP031025.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064926S","chronDate":"April 30 2018-May 4 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8369415","isNumber":"8383882","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8369415","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"8383882","articleId":"8383914","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8383919,"authors":[{"name":"G.

A novel technique is proposed in this paper that self-authenticates an unencrypted FPGA configuration bitstream loaded into the FPGA during startup. The power-on process of an FPGA loads an unencrypted bitstream into the programmable logic portion which embeds the self-authenticating PUF architecture. Challenges are applied to the components of the PUF engine both as a means of generating a key and performing self-authentication. Any modifications made to the PUF architecture results in key generation failure, and failure of subsequent stages of the secure boot process. The generated key is used in the second stage of the boot process to decrypt the programmable logic portion of the design as well as components of the software, e.g., Linux operating system and applications, that run on the processor side of the FPGA.","doi":"10.1109/HST.2018.8383919","publicationTitle":"2018 IEEE International Symposium on Hardware Oriented Security and Trust (HOST)","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 IEEE International Symposium on Hardware Oriented Security and Trust (HOST)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8369415/8383882/08383919.pdf","startPage":"221","endPage":"226","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8383882","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/HST.2018.8383919","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Self-authenticating secure boot for FPGAs","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8383919","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"April 30 2018-May 4 2018","displayDocTitle":"Self-authenticating secure boot for FPGAs","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8383919/","publicationDate":"April 2018","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"14 June 2018","accessionNumber":"17856390","htmlLink":"/document/8383919/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"30 April-4 May 2018","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Self-authenticating secure boot for FPGAs","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"RP036079.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056857S","chronDate":"April 30 2018-May 4 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8369415","isNumber":"8383882","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8369415","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"8383882","articleId":"8383919","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8383920,"authors":[{"name":"Tao Liu","affiliation":["Florida International University"],"firstName":"Tao","lastName":"Liu","id":"37086109431"},{"name":"Wujie Wen","affiliation":["Florida International University"],"firstName":"Wujie","lastName":"Wen","id":"38466944200"},{"name":"Yier Jin","affiliation":["University of Florida"],"firstName":"Yier","lastName":"Jin","id":"37402122400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-4731-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-4732-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8383920","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":629},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8383920","abstract":"Deep Neural Network (DNN) has recently become the \u201cde facto\u201d technique to drive the artificial intelligence (AI) industry.

transmitters. It adopts a digital-to-time converter (DTC) and a highly linear phase calibration loop that improves phase resolution for high data-rate systems. The proposed 10-bit DTC consists of a coarse 5-bit cascaded delay line and a fine 5-bit digitally controlled delay line. This DTC achieves a fine delay resolution with digitally controlled varactors and is capable of introducing incremental delays as small as 2.49 ps. A phase calibration loop based on an advanced successive approximation register (SAR) time-to-digital converter (TDC) is nested inside the phase modulator and sets the DTC output phase accurately across the range of input digital codes. The SAR TDC also compensates for any process, voltage, and temperature variations. By using the proposed SAR TDC-based calibration loop, the phase modulator can achieve a high sampling rate and a fine phase resolution. This was possible because the number of phase comparisons of the SAR TDC has been significantly reduced. The phase modulator achieves 0.61 degrees root-mean-square phase error and a 30 MS/s sampling rate at the carrier frequency of 600 MHz while consuming 9.4 mW. This phase modulator is implemented in a 180-nm CMOS technology and occupies 0.19 mm\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n.","doi":"10.1109/TCSII.2018.2846816","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8629296","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSII.2018.2846816","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs","pdfPath":"/iel7/8920/8629296/08383947.pdf","startPage":"222","endPage":"226","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Fully Digital Phase Modulator With a Highly Linear Phase Calibration Loop for Wideband Polar Transmitters","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 June 2018","displayDocTitle":"A Fully Digital Phase Modulator With a Highly Linear Phase Calibration Loop for Wideband Polar Transmitters","volume":"66","issue":"2","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2019","dateOfInsertion":"29 January 2019","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8383947/","publicationDate":"Feb. 2019","accessionNumber":"18439110","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8383947/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Mobile Sensor and IT Convergence Center"},{"fundingName":"Basic Science Research Program","grantNumber":"NRF-2018R1D1A1B07045432"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Fully Digital Phase Modulator With a Highly Linear Phase Calibration Loop for Wideband Polar Transmitters","sourcePdf":"tcsii-choi-2846816-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.07827S","chronDate":"Feb.  2019","xplore-pub-id":"8920","isNumber":"8629296","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8920","xplore-issue":"8629296","articleId":"8383947","onlineDate":"13 June 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8383950,"authors":[{"name":"Savvas Moysidis","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Democritus University of Thrace, Xanthi, Greece"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7729/8408416/8383950/moysi-2846793-small.gif","p":["Savvas Moysidis received the Dipl.

This property makes graphene an ideal material for bioelectronics applications. The main obstacle for using graphene as a material for bioelectronic circuits is the lack of a bandgap, which results in noneffective current switching. Here, we use rectangular L-shaped graphene nanoribbons as a building block for graphene logic gates. Electrons are initially transported along the zigzag-edged nanoribbon and then the transport direction changes by 90\u00b0, resulting in transport along the armchair edge. Our computations showed that electron scattering because of this change in the direction causes the appearance of a pseudobandgap, which is large enough for logic operations. This pseudobandgap appears as a zero-conductance region for electron energies near the Fermi level. We propose an and, an or, and a not logic gate and use tight-binding Hamiltonians and nonequilibrium Greens functions to show that these designs can reproduce effectively the desired logic operations.","doi":"10.1109/TNANO.2018.2846793","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nanotechnology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nanotechnology","pdfPath":"/iel7/7729/8408416/08383950.pdf","startPage":"852","endPage":"859","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNANO.2018.2846793","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8408416","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Graphene Logic Gates","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8383950","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 June 2018","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8383950/","displayDocTitle":"Graphene Logic Gates","volume":"17","issue":"4","publicationDate":"July 2018","accessionNumber":"17896692","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8383950/","dateOfInsertion":"09 July 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003448","fundingName":"General Secretariat for Research and Technology"},{"fundingName":"Hellenic Foundation for Research and Innovation (HFRI)"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Graphene Logic Gates","sourcePdf":"tnano-karafyllidis-2846793-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.047234S","chronDate":"July  2018","xplore-pub-id":"7729","isNumber":"8408416","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7729","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"8408416","articleId":"8383950","onlineDate":"13 June 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8383952,"authors":[{"name":"Sajad Daei","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Iran University of Science and Technology, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Sajad","lastName":"Daei","orcid":"0000-0001-6866-6595","id":"37086398440"},{"name":"Farzan Haddadi","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Iran University of Science and Technology, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Farzan","lastName":"Haddadi","orcid":"0000-0002-9104-5428","id":"37688981000"},{"name":"Arash Amini","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Arash","lastName":"Amini","orcid":"0000-0002-7082-9581","id":"37574464600"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1070-9908"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2361"}],"articleNumber":"8383952","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":180},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.signalprocessingsociety.org"}],"abstract":"This letter considers the use of total variation (TV) minimization in the recovery of a given gradient sparse vector from Gaussian linear measurements. It has been shown in recent studies that there exists a sharp phase transition behavior in TV minimization for the number of measurements necessary to recover the signal in asymptotic regimes. The phase-transition curve specifies the boundary of success and failure of TV minimization for large number of measurements. It is a challenging task to obtain a theoretical bound that reflects this curve. In this letter, we present a novel upper bound that suitably approximates this curve and is asymptotically sharp. Numerical results show that our bound is closer to the empirical TV phase-transition curve than the previously known bound obtained by Kabanava.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["TV","Minimization","Phase measurement","Convex functions","Geometry","Standards","Complexity theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Gaussian processes","gradient methods","minimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Gaussian linear measurements","sharp phase transition behavior","TV minimization","asymptotic regimes","empirical TV phase-transition curve","sample complexity","total variation minimization","gradient sparse vector"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Phase transition","sample complexity","total variation (TV) minimization"]}],"doi":"10.1109/LSP.2018.2847051","publicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/97/8395241/08383952.pdf","startPage":"1151","endPage":"1155","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8395241","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LSP.2018.2847051","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sample Complexity of Total Variation Minimization","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8383952","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Sample Complexity of Total Variation Minimization","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8383952/","volume":"25","issue":"8","publicationDate":"Aug. 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8383952/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"17874733","dateOfInsertion":"27 June 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2018","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 June 2018","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sample Complexity of Total Variation Minimization","sourcePdf":"lsp-haddadi-2847051-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.074797S","chronDate":"Aug.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"97","isNumber":"8395241","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"97","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"8395241","articleId":"8383952","onlineDate":"13 June 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8383953,"authors":[{"name":"Guido Cavraro","affiliation":["Bradley Department ECE, Virginia Tech, Blacksburg, VA, USA"],"firstName":"Guido","lastName":"Cavraro","orcid":"0000-0003-0296-720X","id":"38228522300"},{"name":"Vassilis Kekatos","affiliation":["Bradley Department ECE, Virginia Tech, Blacksburg, VA, USA"],"firstName":"Vassilis","lastName":"Kekatos","orcid":"0000-0003-1127-3285","id":"37294360600"}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2475-1456"}],"articleNumber":"8383953","dbTime":"22 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":23,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":746},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Topology","Level set","Inverters","Noise measurement","Network topology","Tree graphs","Voltage measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data acquisition","distribution networks","graph theory","invertors","power grids","probability","stochastic processes","topology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["actual feeder","noisy probing data","magnitude","graph algorithms","power grid probing","meaningful optimization task","power distribution operators","line impedances","electric networks","distribution grids","comprehensive metering infrastructure","smart inverters","control purposes","active data acquisition paradigm","voltage deviations","inverter injections","system operator","electric grid topology","inverter probing","feeder processing","graph-based topology identification algorithms","leaf nodes","voltage data","entire feeder topology","reduced feeder","buses probing","modeling inaccuracies","load nonstationarity"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Energy systems","identification","smart grid"]}],"abstract":"To perform any meaningful optimization task, power distribution operators need to know the topology and line impedances of their electric networks. Nevertheless, distribution grids currently lack a comprehensive metering infrastructure. Although smart inverters are widely used for control purposes, they have been recently advocated as the means for an active data acquisition paradigm: reading the voltage deviations induced by intentionally perturbing inverter injections, the system operator can potentially recover the electric grid topology. Adopting inverter probing for feeder processing, a suite of graph-based topology identification algorithms is developed here. If the grid is probed at all leaf nodes but voltage data are metered at all nodes, the entire feeder topology can be successfully recovered. When voltage data are collected only at probing buses, the operator can find a reduced feeder featuring key properties and similarities to the actual feeder. To handle modeling inaccuracies and load nonstationarity, noisy probing data need to be preprocessed. If the suggested guidelines on the magnitude and duration of probing are followed, the recoverability guarantees carry over from the noiseless to the noisy setup with high probability.","doi":"10.1109/LCSYS.2018.2846801","publicationTitle":"IEEE Control Systems Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Control Systems Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/7782633/8392647/08383953.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LCSYS.2018.2846801","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8392647","startPage":"689","endPage":"694","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Graph Algorithms for Topology Identification Using Power Grid Probing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8383953","chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/7782633/8392647/8383953-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Graph Algorithms for Topology Identification Using Power Grid Probing","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8383953/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 June 2018","isJournal":true,"volume":"2","issue":"4","publicationDate":"Oct. 2018","accessionNumber":"17912900","dateOfInsertion":"26 June 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8383953/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"1751085"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","chorusFlag":"true","title":"Graph Algorithms for Topology Identification Using Power Grid Probing","sourcePdf":"lcsys-kekatos-2846801-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.073008S","chronDate":"Oct.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"7782633","isNumber":"8392647","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7782633","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"8392647","articleId":"8383953","onlineDate":"13 June 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8383956,"authors":[{"name":"Ying Lin","affiliation":["Department of Psychology, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6221036/8694089/8383956/lin-2836388-small.gif","p":["Ying Lin (M\u201913) received the B.S. and Ph.D. degrees in computer science from Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China, in 2007 and 2012, respectively.","She is currently an Assistant Professor with the Department of Psychology, Sun Yat-sen University.

Cognitive diagnosis models (CDMs) are a new class of assessment models and have drawn increasing attention for being able to measure examinees' ability in detail. However, few studies have been devoted to the parallel test assembly problem in CDMs (CDM-PTA). To fill the gap, this paper models CDM-PTA as a subset-based bi-objective combinatorial optimization problem. Given an item bank, it aims to find a required number of tests that achieve optimal but balanced diagnostic performance, while satisfying important practical requests in the aspects of test length, item type distribution, and overlapping proportion. A set-based multiobjective particle swarm optimizer based on decomposition (S-MOPSO/D) is proposed to solve the problem. To coordinate with the property of CDM-PTA, S-MOPSO/D utilizes an assignment-based representation scheme and a constructive learning strategy. Through this, promising solutions can be built efficiently based on useful assignment patterns learned from personal and collective search experience on neighboring scalar problems. A heuristic constraint handling strategy is also developed to further enhance the search efficiency. Experimental results in comparison with three representative approaches validate that the proposed algorithm is effective and efficient.","doi":"10.1109/TCYB.2018.2836388","startPage":"2792","endPage":"2805","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics","pdfPath":"/iel7/6221036/8694089/08383956.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCYB.2018.2836388","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8694089","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Discrete Multiobjective Particle Swarm Optimizer for Automated Assembly of Parallel Cognitive Diagnosis Tests","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optimization","Particle swarm optimization","Search problems","Indexes","Reliability","Heuristic algorithms","Cybernetics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognition","combinatorial mathematics","constraint handling","evolutionary computation","learning (artificial intelligence)","optimisation","particle swarm optimisation","search problems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["discrete multiobjective particle swarm optimizer","automated assembly","parallel cognitive diagnosis tests","educational assessment","cognitive diagnosis models","parallel test assembly problem","item bank","diagnostic performance","test length","item type distribution","set-based multiobjective particle swarm optimizer","assignment-based representation scheme","constructive learning strategy","CDM","subset-based biobjective combinatorial optimization problem","CDM-PTA"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cognitive diagnosis models (CDMs)","multiobjective","parallel test assembly","particle swarm optimizer (PSO)"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Algorithms","Artificial Intelligence","Cognition","Educational Measurement","Models, Educational","Psychometrics"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8383956/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 June 2018","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2019","displayDocTitle":"A Discrete Multiobjective Particle Swarm Optimizer for Automated Assembly of Parallel Cognitive Diagnosis Tests","volume":"49","issue":"7","htmlLink":"/document/8383956/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"July 2019","dateOfInsertion":"19 April 2019","isOpenAccess":true,"accessionNumber":"18630395","pubMedId":"29994281","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61772569, 61332002, U1611262 and 61772207"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"A Discrete Multiobjective Particle Swarm Optimizer for Automated Assembly of Parallel Cognitive Diagnosis Tests","sourcePdf":"tcyb-ying-2836388-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.179692S","chronDate":"July  2019","xplore-pub-id":"6221036","isNumber":"8694089","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6221036","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"8694089","articleId":"8383956","onlineDate":"13 June 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8383959,"authors":[{"name":"Hao Zhang","affiliation":["National Laboratory for Optoelectronics, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6221036/8708695/8383959/zhang-2837090-small.gif","p":["Hao Zhang received the M.S. degree from the School of Mathematics and Statistics, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China, in 2015.

To overcome the difficulties from this kind of delay as well as diffusion effects, a comparison-based approach is applied to this model and a series of algebraic criteria are successfully obtained to verify the global asymptotical synchronization. By specifying the existing delays, some M-matrix-based criteria are derived to justify the power-rate synchronization and exponential synchronization.

Since spectrally efficient coherent systems are expected to find a wider deployment in systems shorter than long haul, it becomes relevant to investigate filter implementation aspects of CD compensation in the context of systems with low-to-moderate amounts of accumulated dispersion. The investigation we perform in this paper has an emphasis on implementation aspects such as power dissipation and area usage, it deals with both time-domain and frequency-domain CD compensations, and it considers both A/D-conversion quantization and fixed-point filter design aspects. To enable an accurate analysis on power dissipation and chip area, the evaluated filters are implemented in a 28-nm fully depleted silicon-on-insulator (FD-SOI) process technology. We show that an optimization of the filter response that takes pulse shaping into account can significantly reduce power dissipation and area usage of time-domain implementations, making them a viable alternative to frequency-domain implementations.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Finite impulse response filters","Optimization","Power dissipation","Design methodology","Chromatic dispersion","Throughput"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["digital signal processing chips","frequency-domain analysis","optical fibre communication","silicon-on-insulator","time-domain analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["DSP block","frequency-domain implementations","time-domain implementations","filter response","fixed-point filter design aspects","frequency-domain CD compensations","low-to-moderate amounts","CD compensation","spectrally efficient coherent systems","power dissipation","coherent fiber-optic systems","power-efficient chromatic dispersion compensation","filter implementation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Optical fiber communication","digital signal processing","application specific integrated circuits","chromatic dispersion"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8392551","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JPHOT.2018.2846799","startPage":"1","endPage":"19","publicationTitle":"IEEE Photonics Journal","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Photonics Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/4563994/8392551/08383961.pdf","doi":"10.1109/JPHOT.2018.2846799","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Filter Implementation for Power-Efficient Chromatic Dispersion Compensation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 June 2018","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Filter Implementation for Power-Efficient Chromatic Dispersion Compensation","accessionNumber":"17906130","publicationDate":"Aug. 2018","volume":"10","issue":"4","dateOfInsertion":"13 July 2018","isOpenAccess":true,"externalId":"7202919","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8383961/","impactStatement":"DSP-based chromatic dispersion compensation (CDC) in coherent fiber-optic systems contributes to a large part of the over-all DSP power dissipation.

The model uses both RF/IF signals and baseband envelopes, resulting in the short-term and long-term memory effect mitigated efficiently even for high signal bandwidth. The model complexity is lower than the existing baseband DPDs and does not increase with the increase of the signal bands. The model is experimentally evaluated in three scenarios: two 20 MHz long-term evolution (LTE) signals spaced by 100 and 40 MHz, and three 20 MHz LTE signals spaced by 50 MHz.

The PCA based architecture includes a lightweight communication protocol to enforce security of data through different segments of a continuous, real time patient monitoring architecture. The architecture includes the insertion of data into a personal blockchain to facilitate data sharing amongst healthcare professionals and integration into electronic health records while ensuring privacy is maintained. The blockchain is customized for RPM with modifications that include having the PCA select a Miner to reduce computational effort, enabling the PCA to manage multiple blockchains for the same patient, and the modification of each block with a prefix tree to minimize energy consumption and incorporate secure transaction payments. Simulation results demonstrate that security and privacy can be enhanced in RPM with the PCA based End to End architecture.","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2846779","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/8274985/08383967.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2846779","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8274985","startPage":"32700","endPage":"32726","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Continuous Patient Monitoring With a Patient Centric Agent: A Block Architecture","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8383967","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Continuous Patient Monitoring With a Patient Centric Agent: A Block Architecture","chronOrPublicationDate":"2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8383967/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 June 2018","isJournal":true,"isOpenAccess":true,"volume":"6","publicationDate":"2018","accessionNumber":"17905558","dateOfInsertion":"06 July 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8383967/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100006643","fundingName":"Federation University Australia"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Continuous Patient Monitoring With a Patient Centric Agent: A Block Architecture","sourcePdf":"access-uddin-2846779-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.130677S","chronDate":"2018","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"8274985","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"24","xplore-issue":"8274985","articleId":"8383967","onlineDate":"13 June 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8383975,"authors":[{"name":"Jianchao Chen","affiliation":["School of Information Engineering, Guangdong University of Technology, Guangzhou, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/8274985/8383975/chen-2846773-small.gif","p":["Jianchao Chen was born in Zhanjiang, Guangdong, China.

More specifically, we consider both amplify-and-forward and decode-and-forward protocols and compare the performance between them. From practical consideration, we adopt a stochastic geometry-based model and assume that the spatial topology of relays is modeled by using homogeneous Poisson point process (PPP). Based on such a setting, an effective coverage area of the relays modeled by using homogeneous PPP in cooperative NOMA systems is developed and performance comparison between TSRS and the conventional max-min RS scheme is also presented. According to the locations of the NOMA users, we develop the complete strategies for calculating the effective coverage area of the relays.

Nowadays, NB-IoT technology has been introduced into the Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) standards, where low-overhead, low-data-transmission IoT devices can securely access the fifth generation (5G) core network through the 3GPP access network. However, according to the current 3GPP standard, these NB-IoT devices still employ the traditional authentication process of normal user equipment to implement mutual authentication between NB-IoT devices and 5G core networks, which brings a lot of communication and storage overhead, and it will be more serious when lots of NB-IoT devices are activated simultaneously. In this paper, we propose a fast mutual authentication and data transfer scheme for massive NB-IoT devices, which integrates the access authentication and secure data transmission process and achieves the authentications and data transmissions of a group of NB-IoT devices at the same time. Our scheme can not only greatly simplify the authentication process and alleviate the load of the networks but also ensure robust security protection including user anonymity and nonrepudiation. The performance analysis results show that the proposed scheme can withstand a variety of security attacks with ideal efficiency.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8709863","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JIOT.2018.2846803","publicationTitle":"IEEE Internet of Things Journal","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Internet of Things Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/6488907/8709863/08383979.pdf","startPage":"1561","endPage":"1575","doi":"10.1109/JIOT.2018.2846803","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fast Authentication and Data Transfer Scheme for Massive NB-IoT Devices in 3GPP 5G Network","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2019","displayDocTitle":"Fast Authentication and Data Transfer Scheme for Massive NB-IoT Devices in 3GPP 5G Network","volume":"6","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/8383979/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"April 2019","accessionNumber":"18653949","dateOfInsertion":"08 May 2019","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8383979/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 June 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100012166","fundingName":"National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program)","grantNumber":"2017YFB0802702"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61772404, U1401251 and 61772391"},{"fundingName":"Natural Scientific Basic Research Program Funded by Shaanxi Province of China","grantNumber":"2017JM6029"},{"fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fast Authentication and Data Transfer Scheme for Massive NB-IoT Devices in 3GPP 5G Network","sourcePdf":"jiot-cao-2846803-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.158343S","chronDate":"April  2019","xplore-pub-id":"6488907","isNumber":"8709863","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6488907","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"8709863","articleId":"8383979","onlineDate":"13 June 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":8383980,"authors":[{"name":"Peng Sun","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Industrial Control Technology, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/8274985/8383980/sun-2846815-small.gif","p":["Peng Sun received the B.E. degree in automation from Tianjin University, China, in 2015.","He is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree with the College of Control Science and Engineering, Zhejiang University, China.

Besides, clustering is often integrated into CDG to further facilitate the network performance. However, existing cluster-based CDG methods generally require a large number of sensor nodes to participate in each compressive sensing (CS) measurement gathering and rarely consider possible node failures due to power depletion or malicious attacks, leading to insufficient energy efficiency and poor system robustness. In this paper, we propose a sparsest random sampling scheme for cluster-based CDG (SRS-CCDG) in WSNs to achieve energy efficient and robust data collection. Specifically, sensor nodes are organized into clusters. In each round of data gathering, a random subset of sensor nodes sense the monitored field and transmit their measurements to the corresponding cluster heads (CHs). Then, each CH transmits the data gathered within its cluster to the sink. In SRS-CCDG, each sensor reading is regarded as one CS measurement, and both intra-cluster and inter-cluster data transmissions can be realized by two methods, i.e., relaying or direct transmission. Furthermore, we propose analytical models that study the relationship between the size of clusters and the energy cost when using different intra-cluster and inter-cluster transmission schemes, aimed at finding the optimal size of clusters and transmission schemes that could lead to minimum energy cost. Then, we present a centralized clustering algorithm based on the theoretical analysis. Finally, we investigate the robustness of signal recovery performance of SRS-CCDG when node failures happen. Extensive simulations demonstrate that SRS-CCDG can significantly reduce the energy cost and improve the system robustness to node failures.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8274985","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2846815","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/8274985/08383980.pdf","startPage":"36383","endPage":"36394","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2846815","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sparsest Random Sampling for Cluster-Based Compressive Data Gathering in Wireless Sensor Networks","topic":"Advanced Big Data Analysis for Vehicular Social Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2018","displayDocTitle":"Sparsest Random Sampling for Cluster-Based Compressive Data Gathering in Wireless Sensor Networks","volume":"6","htmlLink":"/document/8383980/","isJournal":true,"isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"2018","accessionNumber":"17905871","dateOfInsertion":"16 July 2018","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8383980/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 June 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"6177020565, U1509215, 6151101271, 61273079, 61773344 and 61502352"},{"fundingName":"Key Projects of Intergovernmental International Scientific and Technological Innovation Cooperation","grantNumber":"2017YFE0101300"},{"fundingName":"State Key Laboratory of Robotics","grantNumber":"2017O-05"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003819","fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of Hubei Province","grantNumber":"2017CFB503"},{"fundingName":"State Key Laboratory for Novel Software Technology","grantNumber":"KFKT2018B09"},{"fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities","grantNumber":"2042018gf0043"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Sparsest Random Sampling for Cluster-Based Compressive Data Gathering in Wireless Sensor Networks","sourcePdf":"access-sun-2846815-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.080685S","chronDate":"2018","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"8274985","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"8274985","topics":["Advanced Big Data Analysis for Vehicular Social Networks"],"articleId":"8383980","onlineDate":"13 June 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":8383981,"authors":[{"name":"Qiang Zheng","affiliation":["Wuhan National Laboratory for Optoelectronics, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"],"bio":{"p":["Qiang Zheng is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree in optical\n engineering at Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China."]},"firstName":"Qiang","lastName":"Zheng","orcid":"0000-0002-2901-7434","id":"37086015417"},{"name":"Liyan Huang","affiliation":["Accelink Technologies Co., Ltd., Wuhan, China"],"bio":{"p":["Liyan Huang has worked on the Raman amplified systems for several\n years.

When the DBP is applied at the receiver side, because in the DBP process the spontaneous Raman scattering is not dealt with, extra NSNI occurs, and because of the high power in the system, the extra NSNI is severe. By adopting split-DBP, the interaction of noise and signal in the high-power region could be avoided. Thus, the extra NSNI was mitigated and the performance was improved. The performance of split-DBP algorithm in such a system was investigated through simulations and experiments, using a single-channel 300-km bi-directional Raman amplified unrepeatered system. The simulations were carried out with 16 QAM modulation and the modulation rates were 32 GBd and 10 GBd. The results showed that the split-DBP can deliver 0.8-dB Q\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n-factor improvement for the case of 32 GBd and 1.3 dB for the case of 10 GBd, compared to the traditional DBP. The impact of the nonlinear transform function of modulator and power profile mismatch on the performance of split-DBP is discussed through the simulation, which is critical to the practical implementation of split-DBP. An experimental demonstration of the split-DBP with 10 GBd 16 QAM modulation was carried out.

To deal with this problem and enhance learning efficiency, this paper introduces an aggregation method by using framework of sample aggregation based on Chinese restaurant process (CRP), named FSA-CRP, to cluster experiential samples, which is represented by quadruples of the current state, action, next state, and the obtained reward. In addition, the proposed algorithm applies a similarity estimation method, the MinHash method, to calculate the similarity between samples. Moreover, to improve the learning efficiency, the experience sharing Dyna learning algorithm based on samples/clusters prediction method is proposed. While an agent learns the value function of the current state, it acquires clustering results, the value functions of the sample merge with the original as the updated value function of the cluster. In indirect learning (planning) for the Dyna-Q, a learning agent looks for the most likely branches of the constructed FSA-CRP model to raise up learning efficiency. The most likely branches will be selected by an improved action/sample selection algorithm. The algorithm applies the probability that the sample appears in the cluster to select simulated experiences for indirect learning. To verify the validity and applicability of the proposed method, experiments are conducted on a simulated maze and a cart-pole system. The results demonstrate that the proposed method can effectively accelerate the learning process.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8274985","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2847048","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/8274985/08383982.pdf","startPage":"37173","endPage":"37184","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2847048","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Sample Aggregation Approach to Experiences Replay of Dyna-Q Learning","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2018","displayDocTitle":"A Sample Aggregation Approach to Experiences Replay of Dyna-Q Learning","volume":"6","htmlLink":"/document/8383982/","isJournal":true,"isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"2018","accessionNumber":"17928116","dateOfInsertion":"23 July 2018","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8383982/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 June 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"National Key Research and Development Program of China","grantNumber":"2017YFB1001900"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004750","fundingName":"Aeronautical Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"2016ZC53022"},{"fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities","grantNumber":"2018026"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"A Sample Aggregation Approach to Experiences Replay of Dyna-Q Learning","sourcePdf":"access-hwang-2847048-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.08258S","chronDate":"2018","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"8274985","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"8274985","articleId":"8383982","onlineDate":"13 June 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-12-29"},{"_id":8383983,"authors":[{"name":"Luis Gustavo Nonato","affiliation":["University of S\u00e3o Paulo, S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/2945/8750990/8383983/gusta-2846735-small.gif","p":["Luis Gustavo Nonato received the PhD degree in applied mathematics from the Pontificia Universidade Cat\u00f3lica do Rio de Janeiro, Rio de Janeiro-Brazil, in 1998.

Multidimensional projections (MDP) figure among the most important visualization techniques in this context, transforming multidimensional data into scatter plots whose visual patterns reflect some notion of similarity in the original data. However, MDP come with distortions that make these visual patterns not trustworthy, hindering users to infer actual data characteristics. Moreover, the patterns present in the scatter plots might not be enough to allow a clear understanding of multidimensional data, motivating the development of layout enrichment methodologies to operate together with MDP. This survey attempts to cover the main aspects of MDP as a visualization and visual analytic tool. It provides detailed analysis and taxonomies as to the organization of MDP techniques according to their main properties and traits, discussing the impact of such properties for visual perception and other human factors. The survey also approaches the different types of distortions that can result from MDP mappings and it overviews existing mechanisms to quantitatively evaluate such distortions. A qualitative analysis of the impact of distortions on the different analytic tasks performed by users when exploring multidimensional data through MDP is also presented. Guidelines for choosing the best MDP for an intended task are also provided as a result of this analysis. Finally, layout enrichment schemes to debunk MDP distortions and/or reveal relevant information not directly inferable from the scatter plot are reviewed and discussed in the light of new taxonomies. We conclude the survey providing future research axes to fill discovered gaps in this domain.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8750990","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2018.2846735","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","pdfPath":"/iel7/2945/8750990/08383983.pdf","startPage":"2650","endPage":"2673","doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2018.2846735","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multidimensional Projection for Visual Analytics: Linking Techniques with Distortions, Tasks, and Layout Enrichment","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 1 2019","displayDocTitle":"Multidimensional Projection for Visual Analytics: Linking Techniques with Distortions, Tasks, and Layout Enrichment","volume":"25","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/8383983/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"1 Aug. 2019","accessionNumber":"18819395","dateOfInsertion":"28 June 2019","pubMedId":"29994258","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8383983/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 June 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003593","fundingName":"Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cient\u00edfico e Tecnol\u00f3gico","grantNumber":"302643/2013-3"},{"fundingName":"Sao Paulo Research Foundation FAPESP","grantNumber":"2016/04391-2"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multidimensional Projection for Visual Analytics: Linking Techniques with Distortions, Tasks, and Layout Enrichment","sourcePdf":"tvcg-nonato-2846735-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.294259S","chronDate":"Aug. 1 2019","xplore-pub-id":"2945","isNumber":"8750990","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"2945","citationCount":"24","xplore-issue":"8750990","articleId":"8383983","onlineDate":"13 June 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-04"},{"_id":8383984,"authors":[{"name":"Bolun Xu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Bolun Xu (S\u201914) received the B.S. degrees in electrical and\n computer engineering from Shanghai Jiaotong University, Shanghai, China in 2011, and the M.Sc. degree in electrical\n engineering from Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, Zurich, Switzerland in 2014.

In this paper, we solve this problem by proposing an optimal control policy and an optimal bidding policy based on realistic market settings and an accurate battery aging model. The proposed control policy has a threshold structure and achieves near-optimal performance with respect to an offline controller that has complete future information. The proposed bidding policy considers the optimal control policy to maximize market profits while satisfying the market performance requirement through a chance-constraint. It factors the value of performance and supports a tradeoff between higher profits and a lower risk of violating performance requirements. We demonstrate the optimality of both policies using simulations. A case study based on the PJM Interconnection LLC (PJM) regulation market shows that the approach is effective at maximizing operating profits.","doi":"10.1109/TPWRS.2018.2846774","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/59/8496918/08383984.pdf","startPage":"6715","endPage":"6725","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPWRS.2018.2846774","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8496918","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8383984","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal Battery Participation in Frequency Regulation Markets","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Optimal Battery Participation in Frequency Regulation Markets","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8383984/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 June 2018","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2018","volume":"33","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8383984/","dateOfInsertion":"18 October 2018","publicationDate":"Nov. 2018","accessionNumber":"18164781","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"University of Washington Clean Energy Institute"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal Battery Participation in Frequency Regulation Markets","sourcePdf":"tpwrs-xu-2846774-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.114192S","chronDate":"Nov.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"59","isNumber":"8496918","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"58","xplore-issue":"8496918","articleId":"8383984","onlineDate":"13 June 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-26"},{"_id":8383992,"authors":[{"name":"Vahid Towhidlou","affiliation":["Department of Informatics, King's College London, London, U.K."],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/8466982/8383992/towhi-2847229-small.gif","p":["Vahid Towhidlou received the B.Sc. degree in electrical engineering\n from the Khajeh Nasir University of Technology, Tehran, Iran, in 1997, the M.Sc. degree from Ferdowsi University,\n Mashhad, Iran, in 2000, and the Ph.D. degree from King's College London, London, U.K., in 2016, both in\n telecommunication engineering.\u00a0","He has been a Research Associate with the Department of Informatics, Centre for Telecommunication Research (CTR),\n King's College London, since 2016.

The secondary network operates adaptively in three modes; cooperative sensing (CS), full duplex transmit and sensing (FDTS), and in-band bidirectional full duplex transmit and receive (FDTR). In the CS mode, the secondary nodes will detect the signal of a primary user (PU) through a novel cooperative medium access control (MAC) protocol and will decide the system's mode of operation in the subsequent spectrum hole. This adaptive decision is based on dual-threshold detection introduced for the first time. When the PU's signal at SU's receivers is weak, the system switches to the FDTS mode to avoid higher collisions probability and long or endless collision durations. In the FDTS mode, one of SUs senses the PU activity continuously while transmitting to another node. When the channel conditions allow, the system switches to the FDTR mode, in which the SUs would communicate bidirectionally in an asynchronous full duplex manner. The novel idea of asynchronous transmission in this mode will result in decreased maximum and average collision durations. Analytical closed forms for probability of collision, average collision duration, and cumulative collision duration, as well as throughput of the SU network are derived, and performance of the proposed scheme in terms of the above-mentioned metrics, effectiveness, and advantages over conventional methods of sensing and transmission are verified via simulations.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2018.2847229","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8466982","startPage":"8386","endPage":"8395","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/25/8466982/08383992.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive Full-Duplex Communications in Cognitive Radio Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8383992/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2018","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 June 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8383992/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Adaptive Full-Duplex Communications in Cognitive Radio Networks","publicationDate":"Sept. 2018","accessionNumber":"18095140","dateOfInsertion":"17 September 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"67","issue":"9","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"5GCAR H2020 European Project"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive Full-Duplex Communications in Cognitive Radio Networks","sourcePdf":"tvt-towhidlou-2847229-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.080126S","chronDate":"Sept.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"8466982","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"8466982","articleId":"8383992","onlineDate":"13 June 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"Crown","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8383996,"authors":[{"name":"Antonio J.

This review will start with the introduction to the organ-dedicated MI systems. Thereafter, we will describe the differences and their advantages/disadvantages when compared with the standard large size scanners. We will review time evolution of dedicated systems, from first attempts to current scanners, and the ones that ended in clinical use. We will review later the state of the art of these systems for different organs, namely: breast, brain, heart, and prostate. We will also present the advantages offered by these systems as a function of the special application or field, such as in surgery, therapy assistance and assessment, etc. Their technological evolution will be introduced for each organ-based imager. Some of the advantages of dedicated devices are: higher sensitivity by placing the detectors closer to the organ, improved spatial resolution, better image contrast recovery (by reducing the noise from other organs), and also lower cost. Designing a complete ring-shaped dedicated PET scanner is sometimes difficult and limited angle tomography systems are preferable as they have more flexibility in placing the detectors around the body/organ. Examples of these geometries will be presented for breast, prostate and heart imaging. Recently achievable excellent time of flight capabilities below 300-ps full width at half of the maximum reduce significantly the impact of missing angles on the reconstructed images.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Organ-Dedicated Molecular Imaging Systems","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Radiation and Plasma Medical Sciences","doi":"10.1109/TRPMS.2018.2846745","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Radiation and Plasma Medical Sciences","pdfPath":"/iel7/7433213/8453249/08383996.pdf","startPage":"388","endPage":"403","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TRPMS.2018.2846745","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8453249","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8383996","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8383996/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 June 2018","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2018","displayDocTitle":"Organ-Dedicated Molecular Imaging Systems","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"2","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/8383996/","dateOfInsertion":"31 August 2018","publicationDate":"Sept. 2018","accessionNumber":"18091888","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000781","fundingName":"European Research Council through the European Union\u2019s Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Program","grantNumber":"695536"},{"fundingName":"EU through the FP7 Program","grantNumber":"603002"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003329","fundingName":"Ministerio de Econom\u00eda y Competitividad","grantNumber":"DTS15/00152"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003329","fundingName":"Ministerio de Econom\u00eda y Competitividad","grantNumber":"TEC2016-79884-C2-1-R"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Organ-Dedicated Molecular Imaging Systems","sourcePdf":"trpms-gonzalezmartinez-2846745-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.141358S","chronDate":"Sept.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"7433213","isNumber":"8453249","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7433213","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"8453249","articleId":"8383996","onlineDate":"13 June 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8383998,"authors":[{"name":"A.

Leveraging users' social information, SV-MAC can realize social-aware D2D discovery, association, and resource allocation for improved D2D communication efficiency. In order to validate the advantages of the proposed SV-MAC protocol, we study the cellular and D2D resource allocation problems under the SV-MAC protocol. The problems are formulated as maximizing the cellular and D2D energy efficiency (EE). The cellular resource allocation problem is first solved considering its priority to D2D users. The resource allocation problem for D2D users is solved after cellular users to control the D2D-to-cellular interference within a tolerable threshold. In the simulation, we introduce real mobile user traces to simulate the user social information. Simulation results show that the proposed SV-MAC resource allocation schemes obtain a beneficial EE improvement comparing with conventional schemes.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2018.2846811","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/25/8466982/08384012.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2018.2846811","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8466982","startPage":"8372","endPage":"8385","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Social-Aware Virtual MAC Protocol for Energy-Efficient D2D Communications Underlying Heterogeneous Cellular Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8384012","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A Social-Aware Virtual MAC Protocol for Energy-Efficient D2D Communications Underlying Heterogeneous Cellular Networks","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8384012/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 June 2018","isJournal":true,"volume":"67","issue":"9","publicationDate":"Sept. 2018","accessionNumber":"18095131","dateOfInsertion":"17 September 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8384012/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61471060"},{"fundingName":"National Science Foundation for Young Scientists of China","grantNumber":"61701125"},{"fundingName":"National Science and Technology Major","grantNumber":"2018ZX03001019-003"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Social-Aware Virtual MAC Protocol for Energy-Efficient D2D Communications Underlying Heterogeneous Cellular Networks","sourcePdf":"tvt-bo-2846811-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.092729S","chronDate":"Sept.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"8466982","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"8466982","articleId":"8384012","onlineDate":"13 June 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8384016,"authors":[{"name":"Weichao Gao","affiliation":["Department of Computer and Information Sciences, Towson University, Towson, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6488902/9108636/8384016/gao-2846736-small.gif","p":["Weichao Gao received the B.S. degree from Fudan University, Shanghai, China, in 2005, the M.B.A degree from University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA, in 2011, and the M.S. degree in computer science and technology in 2017 from Towson University, Towson, MD, USA. where he is currently working toward the doctoral.

As a fundamental commodity in our current information age, big data is a crucial key to competitiveness in modern commerce. In this paper, we address the issue of privacy preservation for data auction in CPS by leveraging the concept of homomorphic cryptography and secure network protocol design. Specifically, we propose a generic Privacy-Preserving Auction Scheme (PPAS), in which the two independent entities of Auctioneer and Intermediate Platform comprise an untrusted third-party trading platform. Via the implementation of homomorphic encryption and one-time pad, a winner in the auction process can be determined and all bidding information is disguised. Yet, to further improve the security of the privacy-preserving auction, we additionally propose an Enhanced Privacy-Preserving Auction Scheme (EPPAS) that leverages an additional signature verification mechanism. The feasibilities of both schemes are validated through detailed theoretical analyses and extensive performance evaluations, including assessment of the resilience to attacks. In addition, we discuss some open issues and extensions relevant to our scheme.","doi":"10.1109/TNSE.2018.2846736","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Network Science and Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Network Science and Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel7/6488902/9108636/08384016.pdf","startPage":"776","endPage":"791","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9108636","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNSE.2018.2846736","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Privacy-Preserving Auction for Big Data Trading Using Homomorphic Encryption","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8384016","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"April-June 1 2020","displayDocTitle":"Privacy-Preserving Auction for Big Data Trading Using Homomorphic Encryption","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8384016/","publicationDate":"1 April-June 2020","dateOfInsertion":"04 June 2020","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"19670627","htmlLink":"/document/8384016/","volume":"7","issue":"2","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 June 2018","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Privacy-Preserving Auction for Big Data Trading Using Homomorphic Encryption","sourcePdf":"tnse-yu-2846736-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.223601S","chronDate":"April-June 1 2020","xplore-pub-id":"6488902","isNumber":"9108636","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6488902","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"9108636","articleId":"8384016","onlineDate":"13 June 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2020","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8384024,"authors":[{"name":"Jin-Guk Kim","affiliation":["School of Energy Science, Kim Il Sung University, Pyongyang, DPR Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/8636215/8384024/kim-2847044-small.gif","p":["Jin-Guk Kim received the B.S. and M.S. degrees from Kim Il Sung University, Pyongyang, DPR Korea, in 2005 and 2009, respectively.

Conventional 2FSK-WPIT technologies commonly employ single resonant band, and due to the insufficient utilization of system resonance, they have inherent disadvantages, such as low efficiency and low system quality factor. In the proposed technology, the system employs dual resonant bands of the SPRC and both of the system carriers use the resonant frequencies, and so the disadvantages of the conventional 2FSK-WPIT technology are eliminated. Optimal design of the SPRC-2FSK-WPIT system is conducted. In the optimized system, the two carriers have similar power and information transfer characteristics, and so a high WPIT performance, including stable power transmission, is guaranteed. The proposed technology is validated by experimental results. The experimental prototype shows up to 20 kb/s of communication rate with maintaining the power transfer efficiency over 85% at the distance of 50 mm.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Dual band","Q-factor","Resonant frequency","Frequency shift keying","RLC circuits","Transient analysis","Wireless communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["frequency shift keying","inductive power transmission","radio networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["system resonance","single resonant band","SPRC-2FSK-WPIT technology","wireless power","series-parallel combined resonant circuit","dual bands","2FSK modulation","power transfer efficiency","high WPIT performance","information transfer characteristics","SPRC-2FSK-WPIT system","resonant frequencies","system carriers","dual resonant bands","low system quality factor"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Communication rate","frequency-shift keying (FSK)","series\u2013parallel combined resonant circuit (SPRC)","topology","wireless power and information simultaneous transfer (WPIT)"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2018.2847044","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/63/8636215/08384024.pdf","startPage":"2956","endPage":"2965","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8636215","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2018.2847044","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Wireless Power and Information Simultaneous Transfer Technology Based on 2FSK Modulation Using the Dual Bands of Series\u2013Parallel Combined Resonant Circuit","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8384024","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A Wireless Power and Information Simultaneous Transfer Technology Based on 2FSK Modulation Using the Dual Bands of Series\u2013Parallel Combined Resonant Circuit","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8384024/","volume":"34","issue":"3","publicationDate":"March 2019","htmlLink":"/document/8384024/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"18452337","dateOfInsertion":"06 February 2019","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2019","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 June 2018","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"51577041"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Wireless Power and Information Simultaneous Transfer Technology Based on 2FSK Modulation Using the Dual Bands of Series\u2013Parallel Combined Resonant Circuit","sourcePdf":"tpel-kim-2847044-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.088203S","chronDate":"March  2019","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"8636215","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"8636215","articleId":"8384024","onlineDate":"13 June 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-29"},{"_id":8384029,"authors":[{"name":"Manu V.

The approach is data driven and model independent. Its design phase is carried out offline and requires estimates of the synchronous generators' rotor angle and speed, along with active and reactive power at the generators' terminal; in real-time operation, only measurements of the rotor speed, active, and reactive power are used. We first investigate the probability distribution of the transformed dynamic states by means of Q-Q plots and verify that the states of the GM-KKF approximately follow a Student's t-distribution with 20 degrees of freedom when the initial state vector is normally distributed. Under this assumption, our filter presents high statistical efficiency. Numerical simulations carried out on the IEEE 39-bus test system reveal that the GM-KKF has a faster convergence rate than the non-robust Koopman operator-based Kalman filter thanks to the adoption of a batch-mode regression formulation. They also show that the computing time of the GM-KKF is roughly reduced by one-third as compared to the one taken by our previously developed robust GM-extended Kalman filter.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8384030/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2018","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 June 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8384030/","dateOfInsertion":"18 October 2018","publicationDate":"Nov. 2018","accessionNumber":"18164803","volume":"33","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A Robust Data-Driven Koopman Kalman Filter for Power Systems Dynamic State Estimation","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"CAPES Foundation"},{"fundingName":"Ministry of Education of Brazil","grantNumber":"BEX13594/13-3"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Robust Data-Driven Koopman Kalman Filter for Power Systems Dynamic State Estimation","sourcePdf":"tpwrs-netto-2846744-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.183165S","chronDate":"Nov.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"59","isNumber":"8496918","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"8496918","articleId":"8384030","onlineDate":"13 June 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":8384037,"authors":[{"name":"Ali Reza Heidarpour","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB, Canada"],"firstName":"Ali Reza","lastName":"Heidarpour","orcid":"0000-0002-5548-9697","id":"37085634503"},{"name":"Masoud Ardakani","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB, Canada"],"firstName":"Masoud","lastName":"Ardakani","orcid":"0000-0002-5997-1093","id":"37272335000"},{"name":"Chintha Tellambura","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB, Canada"],"firstName":"Chintha","lastName":"Tellambura","orcid":"0000-0002-9419-7195","id":"37281000600"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-7798"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2558"},{"format":"CD","value":"2373-7891"}],"articleNumber":"8384037","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":278},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8384037","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Relays","Power system reliability","Probability","Signal to noise ratio","Diversity methods","Channel state information","Network coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel coding","cooperative communication","diversity reception","network coding","probability","relay networks (telecommunication)","telecommunication network reliability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["asymptotic diversity gain","outdated channel state information","multiple-relay network-coded cooperation","relay selection","nonbinary network coding","maximum distance separable codes","outage probability","cooperative relays"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Network-coded cooperation","relay selection","outdated CSI","diversity gain"]}],"abstract":"The impact of outdated channel state information (CSI) on the performance of multiple-source, multiple-relay network-coded cooperation (NCC) with relay selection (RS) is investigated.

As a highly varying data source, wind speed time series requires highly nonlinear temporal features for the prediction tasks. However, most forecasting approaches apply shallow supervised features extracted using architectures with few nonlinear hidden layers. Moreover, the exact features captured in such methodologies cannot decrease the wind data uncertainties. In this paper, an interval probability distribution learning (IPDL) model is proposed based on restricted Boltzmann machines and rough set theory to capture unsupervised temporal features from wind speed data. The proposed model contains a set of interval latent variables tuned to capture the probability distribution of wind speed time series data using contrastive divergence with Gibbs sampling. A real-valued interval deep belief network (IDBN) is further designed employing a stack of IPDLs with a fuzzy type II inference system (FT2IS) for the supervised regression of future wind speed values. In order to automatically learn meaningful unsupervised features from the underlying wind speed data, real-valued input units are designed inside IDBN to better approximate the wind speed probability distribution function compared to classic deep belief networks. The high generalization capability of our unsupervised feature learning model incorporated with the robustness of IPDLs and FT2IS leads to accurate predictions. Simulation results on the Western Wind Dataset reveal significant performance improvement in 1-h up to 24-h ahead predictions compared to single-model approaches including both shallow and deep architectures, as well as recently proposed hybrid methodologies.","doi":"10.1109/TSG.2018.2847223","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on

The number of radio frequency chains required increases linearly with the number of transmit antennas in a Multiple Input Multiple Output System leading to increase in cost and power consumption. Generalized Spatial Modulation mitigates the above problem by transmitting symbols through only a few of the all available transmit antenna elements at a given time. In other words only a few of the transmit antennas are active at a given time. We here present an under-determined spatially modulated MIMO system. We call it under-determined because the number of receive antennas is lesser than the number of transmit antennas. Sparse reconstruction theory has been used earlier for symbol detection for over-determined spatially modulated MIMO system. We apply sparse reconstruction theory for the under-determined case, and get a decoder with complexity of the order of cube of the number of active antennas compared to high complexity ML decoder. The BER results at different SNR values presented here indicate that the low complexity algorithm performs well for small number of active antennas.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Transmitting antennas","Receiving antennas","Modulation","MIMO communication","Radio frequency","Complexity theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","error statistics","MIMO communication","modulation","receiving antennas","transmitting antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiple active antennas","transmitted symbols","single carrier generalized spatial modulation","transmit antennas","Multiple Input Multiple Output System","MIMO system","receive antennas","ML decoder","single carrier spatial modulation systems"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Spatial Modulation","Single Carrier","Massive MIMO","Constrained Optimization","Basis Pursuit DeNoising","Underdetermined System"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ANTS.2017.8384090","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Advanced Networks and Telecommunications Systems (ANTS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Advanced Networks and Telecommunications Systems (ANTS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8374003/8384083/08384090.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8384083","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ANTS.2017.8384090","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reduced complexity detection of under-determined single carrier spatial modulation systems with multiple active antennas","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8384090","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Reduced complexity detection of under-determined single carrier spatial modulation systems with multiple active antennas","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8384090/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8384090/","accessionNumber":"17856690","conferenceDate":"17-20 Dec. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"14 June 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-20 Dec. 2017","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reduced complexity detection of under-determined single carrier spatial modulation systems with multiple active antennas","confLoc":"Bhubaneswar, India","sourcePdf":"AuthorsPaper103ANTS2017.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066147S","chronDate":"17-20 Dec. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8374003","isNumber":"8384083","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8374003","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8384083","articleId":"8384090","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-20"},{"_id":8384093,"authors":[{"name":"K.

We take a machine learning approach, wherein, we train a Gaussian process regression (GP) model with uplink RSS vectors for several known training user locations and use the trained GP model for predicting locations of test users from their uplink RSS vectors. When the training RSS is noise-free and the test RSS is noisy due to shadowing from the wireless channel, we observe that the conventional GP method provides unrealistically small 2\u03c3 error-bars on the predicted locations. To address this shortcoming, we propose NAGP - a numerical approximation based GP method which employs averaging over Monte-Carlo samples to improve the 2\u03c3 error-bar estimates.

Orthogonal Frequency Domain Multiplexing (OFDM) has been proposed for troposcatter link design [1]. However, OFDM being a multi-carrier transmission scheme suffers from high Peak to Average Power Ratio (PAPR) problem which leads to non-linear distortion by Power Amplifier (PA) and considerable SNR loss if input signal is backed off. Single Carrier Frequency Domain Equalisation (SCFDE) exhibits a low PAPR, due to single carrier transmission, while retaining the advantage of Frequency Domain Equalisation (FDE). We present a troposcatter link design based on SCFDE in this paper. The design incorporates all the components of a practical system and is hardware implementable. It employs Low Density Parity Check (LDPC) Forward Error Correction (FEC) coding for SNR gain, QPSK/ 16 QAM modulation, Solid State Power Amplifier (SSPA) model to analyse the effect of nonlinearity and Input Back Off (IBO), frequency and timing synchronisation using double sliding window packet detection and Moose algorithm, Zero Forcing (ZF) channel estimation with Minimum Mean Square Error (MMSE) equalisation and dual diversity with Maximal Ratio Combining (MRC) combining. A novel frame format has been presented suited to the link design. Simulation parameters are derived from parameters of actual troposcatter links located in North China and between Dallas and Austin, Texas (U.S.A). SCFDE achieves a link margin of 3.4 dB with QPSK modulation and 2.8 dB with 16 QAM modulation due to high IBO for OFDM.","doi":"10.1109/ANTS.2017.8384095","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8384083","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ANTS.2017.8384095","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Advanced Networks and Telecommunications Systems (ANTS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Advanced Networks and Telecommunications Systems (ANTS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8374003/8384083/08384095.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design of troposcatter broadband link based on SCFDE","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"17-20 Dec. 2017","displayDocTitle":"Design of troposcatter broadband link based on SCFDE","isConference":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"17-20 Dec. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"14 June 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8384095/","publicationDate":"Dec. 2017","accessionNumber":"17856689","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8384095/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design of troposcatter broadband link based on SCFDE","confLoc":"Bhubaneswar, India","sourcePdf":"AuthorsPaper11ANTS2017.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.075845S","chronDate":"17-20 Dec. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8374003","isNumber":"8384083","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8374003","xplore-issue":"8384083","articleId":"8384095","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-21"},{"_id":8384096,"authors":[{"name":"Sisaara Perera","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering The Open University of Sri Lanka, Nawala, Nugegoda, Sri Lanka"],"firstName":"Sisaara","lastName":"Perera","id":"37086396923"},{"name":"Nuwan Balasuriya","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering The Open University of Sri Lanka, Nawala, Nugegoda, Sri Lanka"],"firstName":"Nuwan","lastName":"Balasuriya","id":"37391444400"},{"name":"Manoj Sithara","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering The Open University of Sri Lanka, Nawala, Nugegoda, Sri Lanka"],"firstName":"Manoj","lastName":"Sithara","id":"37086396070"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2347-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2346-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2348-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8384096","dbTime":"18 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":92},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8384096","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Parameter estimation","Predictive models","Sensors","Indexes","Cognitive radio","Complexity theory","Correlation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","parameter estimation","signal detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiterm parameter estimation","primary user activity modeling","SU","PU activity information","long-term parameter estimation based activity modeling","short-term parameter estimation","PU activity modeling scheme","cognitive radio systems","spectrum sensing process"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Primary user activity","parameter estimation","multi-term modeling","practical channel conditions"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ANTS.2017.8384096","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Advanced Networks and Telecommunications Systems (ANTS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Advanced Networks and Telecommunications Systems (ANTS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8374003/8384083/08384096.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ANTS.2017.8384096","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8384083","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Primary user activity modeling using multi-term parameter estimation in cognitive radio systems","abstract":"Primary user (PU) activity modeling is a technique used to produce more information at the secondary user (SU) during its spectrum sensing process. With the PU activity information, the SU is able to obtain a better decision in selecting a vacant channel for its communication. However, the long-term parameter estimation based activity modeling is seen to be missing the valuable spectrum opportunities under burst traffic conditions while the short-term parameter estimation based PU activity modeling techniques can capture these opportunities with an added complexity. At the same time, poor correlation among traffic at different time intervals can dramatically reduce the accuracy in short-term modeling. On the other hand, the actual PU behavior can be shadowed from the SU due to the practical channel impairments. These give rise to a situation that neither the short-term nor the long-term parameter estimation based activity modeling are accurate under all conditions. This paper proposes a multi-term parameter estimation based PU activity modeling scheme which produces a higher spectrum sensing efficiency while retaining the simplicity. Furthermore, the proposed scheme produces an efficient way of primary user activity modeling under realistic channel conditions. The simulation results verify the superior modeling accuracy versus the complexity trade-off of the proposed scheme when compared to the existing modeling techniques.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"17-20 Dec. 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8384096/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"17856736","publicationDate":"Dec. 2017","conferenceDate":"17-20 Dec. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8384096/","dateOfInsertion":"14 June 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Primary user activity modeling using multi-term parameter estimation in cognitive radio systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Primary user activity modeling using multi-term parameter estimation in cognitive radio systems","confLoc":"Bhubaneswar, India","sourcePdf":"AuthorsPaper12ANTS2017.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072368S","chronDate":"17-20 Dec. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8374003","isNumber":"8384083","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8374003","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8384083","articleId":"8384096","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8384098,"authors":[{"name":"Shaifu Gupta","affiliation":["School of Computing and Electrical Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology Mandi, Kamand, H.P., India"],"firstName":"Shaifu","lastName":"Gupta","id":"37086217405"},{"name":"Dileep Aroor Dinesh","affiliation":["School of Computing and Electrical Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology Mandi, Kamand, H.P., India"],"firstName":"Dileep Aroor","lastName":"Dinesh","id":"37086227695"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2347-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2346-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2348-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8384098","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":13,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":572},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Predictive models","Time series analysis","Logic gates","Analytical models","Cloud computing","Market research","Mathematical model"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","recurrent neural nets","resource allocation","time series"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud workloads","deep bidirectional long short term memory networks","multivariate long short term memory models","LSTM models","optimal resource provisioning","time series resource usage prediction models"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8384098","abstract":"Resource usage prediction is an important aspect for achieving optimal resource provisioning in cloud.

The major drawbacks of FSO are absorption, scattering and atmospheric turbulence that affect the performance of FSO in terms of bit error rate (BER) and hence, limits the transmission distance. In this paper, novel integrated spectral amplitude coding optical code division multiple access (SAC-OCDMA) code is proposed referred in this work as pulse transposition-zero cross correlation (PT-ZCC) code. Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) is of prime significance these days in long-haul communication systems because of its immunity to multipath fading, higher bandwidth proficiency, and its flexibility to interference. Therefore, the proposed PT-ZCC code is furthermore, integrated with the OFDM technique so as to improve the performance of the FSO system in terms of BER.

An optimization problem is formulated that searches for the cluster-wise relay selection and consequent power allocation with an objective to maximize the sum throughput of the secondary network under the constraints of the interference power limit and the probability of primary user's (PU) signal detection. Fuzzy c-means clustering algorithm is applied to associate a set of secondary users (SUs) to form a cluster at the source as well as in destination end followed by their link establishment via a particular relay. Closed form expression for the optimal cluster power allocation is derived and the performance of the proposed system is investigated in terms of secondary network throughput and sum cluster power for SU data transmission. A large set of simulation results show that a gain ~24.37% and ~36.03% in SU throughput are achieved for the proposed scheme when compared to the existing works.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8384125/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-20 Dec. 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"14 June 2018","accessionNumber":"17856720","htmlLink":"/document/8384125/","conferenceDate":"17-20 Dec. 2017","displayDocTitle":"Optimal cluster power for joint spectrum sensing and secondary data transmission in cognitive radio networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal cluster power for joint spectrum sensing and secondary data transmission in cognitive radio networks","confLoc":"Bhubaneswar, India","sourcePdf":"AuthorsPaper39ANTS2017.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071712S","chronDate":"17-20 Dec. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8374003","isNumber":"8384083","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8374003","xplore-issue":"8384083","articleId":"8384125","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8384138,"authors":[{"name":"T Varsha Ram","affiliation":["Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham, Coimbatore, Tamil Nadu, IN"],"firstName":"T Varsha","lastName":"Ram"},{"name":"Sriram Sankaran","affiliation":["Center for Cybersecurity Systems & Networks, Amrita University, Amritapuri, India"],"firstName":"Sriram","lastName":"Sankaran","id":"37085680460"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2347-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2346-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2348-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8384138","dbTime":"27 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":79},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cloud computing","Energy consumption","Power demand","Java","Virtual machining","Meters","Servers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","optimisation","power consumption"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","power consumption","cloud service providers","computing resources","energy consumption","policy-driven power management","performance consumption","scale-out techniques","scale-up techniques","openstack implementation","optimal trade-off","generic application"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cloud Computing","Power Management"]}],"abstract":"Cloud computing enables users to rent computing resources on-demand towards meeting the needs of diverse applications. However, scaling of resources may incur significant impact on performance and power consumption which are the two key concerns for cloud service providers. The major goal of cloud providers is to develop policies for balancing the conflicting objectives of maximizing performance and minimizing energy consumption. Towards this goal, we analyze the impact of scale-up and scale-out techniques for varying cloud workloads through an OpenStack implementation. Our analysis reveals that these techniques vary with the nature of applications that run on the cloud as a result of which policies need to be developed on a per-application basis. We develop a threshold-based policy which determines the optimal trade-off depending on the application profile. Our proposed policy is generic and can be applied to other workloads thus facilitating efficient management of resources.","doi":"10.1109/ANTS.2017.8384138","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Advanced Networks and Telecommunications Systems (ANTS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Advanced Networks and Telecommunications Systems (ANTS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8374003/8384083/08384138.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ANTS.2017.8384138","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8384083","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Towards policy-driven power management for cloud computing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8384138","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Towards policy-driven power management for cloud computing","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-20 Dec. 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8384138/","conferenceDate":"17-20 Dec. 2017","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2017","accessionNumber":"17843562","dateOfInsertion":"14 June 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8384138/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Towards policy-driven power management for cloud computing","confLoc":"Bhubaneswar, India","sourcePdf":"AuthorsPaper50ANTS2017.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062072S","chronDate":"17-20 Dec. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8374003","isNumber":"8384083","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8374003","xplore-issue":"8384083","articleId":"8384138","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8384159,"authors":[{"name":"Anand Agrawal","affiliation":["School of Electronics Engineering, KIIT University, Bhubaneswar, Odisha, India"],"firstName":"Anand","lastName":"Agrawal","id":"37085629830"},{"name":"Rakhesh Singh Kshetrimayum","affiliation":["Department of Electronics & Electrical Engineering, IIT Guwahati, Assam, India"],"firstName":"Rakhesh Singh","lastName":"Kshetrimayum","id":"37265791000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2347-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2346-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2348-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8384159","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":188},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interference","IEEE 802.15 Standard","Signal to noise ratio","Channel models","MIMO communication","Fading channels","Multipath channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["intersymbol interference","millimetre wave antenna arrays","millimetre wave communication","MIMO communication","radio receivers","radiofrequency interference","transmitting antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["inter-symbol interferences","mm-Wave signals","mm-wave MIMO system","output signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio","IEEE 802.15.3c channel model","SINR analysis","millimeter-wave wireless communication system","frequency 60.0 GHz"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["mm-Wave communication","IEEE 802.15.3c channel at 60 GHz","MIMO and Beamforming"]}],"abstract":"Using first and second order moments, we derive an expression of output signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) for the Millimeter-wave (mm-Wave) wireless communication system over IEEE 802.15.3c channel model at 60 GHz band.

Due to the characteristics of IoT devices (i.e., low power and low battery), usage of these devices in critical applications requires sophisticated security measures. Researchers from academia and industry now increasingly exploit the concept of blockchains to achieve security in IoT applications. The basic idea of the blockchain is that the data generated by users or devices in the past are verified for correctness and cannot be tampered once it is updated on the blockchain. Even though the blockchain supports integrity and non-repudiation to some extent, confidentiality and privacy of the data or the devices are not preserved. The content of the data can be seen by anyone in the network for verification and mining purposes. In order to address these privacy issues, we propose a new privacy-preserving blockchain architecture for IoT applications based on attribute-based encryption (ABE) techniques. Security, privacy, and numerical analyses are presented to validate the proposed model.","doi":"10.1109/ANTS.2017.8384164","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ANTS.2017.8384164","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Advanced Networks and Telecommunications Systems (ANTS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Advanced Networks and Telecommunications Systems (ANTS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8374003/8384083/08384164.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8384083","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Privacy-preserving blockchain based IoT ecosystem using attribute-based encryption","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8384164/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-20 Dec. 2017","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Privacy-preserving blockchain based IoT ecosystem using attribute-based encryption","conferenceDate":"17-20 Dec. 2017","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"14 June 2018","publicationDate":"Dec. 2017","accessionNumber":"17843555","htmlLink":"/document/8384164/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Privacy-preserving blockchain based IoT ecosystem using attribute-based encryption","confLoc":"Bhubaneswar, India","sourcePdf":"AuthorsPaper74ANTS2017.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054669S","chronDate":"17-20 Dec. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8374003","isNumber":"8384083","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8374003","citationCount":"25","xplore-issue":"8384083","articleId":"8384164","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8384179,"authors":[{"name":"Kotte Vijith Varma","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology Delhi, New Delhi, India"],"firstName":"Kotte Vijith","lastName":"Varma","id":"37086396979"},{"name":"Hari Krishna Boddapati","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology Delhi, New Delhi, India"],"firstName":"Hari Krishna","lastName":"Boddapati","id":"37085814658"},{"name":"Manav R.

In massive MIMO systems, pilot contamination degrades the performance of uplink (UL) channel estimation. It has been shown that data-aided channel estimation method can achieve a better performance than pilot-aided channel estimation method. In this paper, to mitigate the effects of pilot contamination, we propose a data-aided semi-blind channel estimation method based on independent component analysis (ICA) that does not require cell cooperation or statistical information of the channels. Based on demodulated UL data of all users in the target cell, we finally obtain the least square (LS) estimate of the channel. This demodulated data contains a short training sequence just for ambiguity correction. In order to obtain a better performance compared to the previous works, we use mutual information as a new criterion in ICA.

If the network is not managed efficiently, this huge amount of data will increase the congestion in the cellular network. Caching at the edge of the cellular network is one of the prominent solutions to mitigate this issue. By deploying Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) at eNodeB (eNB), distributed edge caching can be realized in the cellular network. In this work, we propose a consolidated caching scheme with cache splitting and trans-rating in MEC network. Cache consolidation uses the collaborative capability of MEC servers to avoid replication of videos in the MEC cache network thus increasing the caching capacity. Without replication, access delay may increase. To maintain low access delay, we split the cache storage into two logical parts; full video cache, and initial video cache. Full video cache stores the complete videos without any replication in the MEC cache network and initial video cache stores only initial segments of the videos. Initial segments of the videos are replicated in the cache network to reduce the access delay. Extensive simulations results show improvement in initial access delay, cache hit ratio, and external traffic load compared to the existing solutions.","doi":"10.1109/ANTS.2017.8384182","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8384083","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ANTS.2017.8384182","endPage":"6","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Advanced Networks and Telecommunications Systems (ANTS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Advanced Networks and Telecommunications Systems (ANTS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8374003/8384083/08384182.pdf","startPage":"1","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Consolidated caching with cache splitting and trans-rating in mobile edge computing networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"17-20 Dec. 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8384182/","displayDocTitle":"Consolidated caching with cache splitting and trans-rating in mobile edge computing networks","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"17-20 Dec. 2017","accessionNumber":"17856678","dateOfInsertion":"14 June 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8384182/","publicationDate":"Dec. 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Consolidated caching with cache splitting and trans-rating in mobile edge computing networks","confLoc":"Bhubaneswar, India","sourcePdf":"AuthorsPaper90ANTS2017.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.112566S","chronDate":"17-20 Dec. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8374003","isNumber":"8384083","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8374003","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"8384083","articleId":"8384182","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8384183,"authors":[{"name":"Arijit Datta","affiliation":["Discipline of Electrical Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology, Indore, Madhya Pradesh, India"],"firstName":"Arijit","lastName":"Datta","id":"37086262014"},{"name":"Vimal Bhatia","affiliation":["Discipline of Electrical Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology, Indore, Madhya Pradesh, India"],"firstName":"Vimal","lastName":"Bhatia","id":"37085366171"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2347-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2346-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2348-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8384183","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":80},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO communication","Receivers","Detection algorithms","Vibrations","Detectors","Signal processing algorithms","Complexity theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ant colony optimisation","interference suppression","least mean squares methods","maximum likelihood detection","MIMO communication","particle swarm optimisation","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiple-input multiple-output system","large MIMO systems","meta-heuristic techniques","social spider optimizer based large MIMO detector","zero forcing","conventional MIMO detection techniques","efficient low complexity detector","wireless communication systems","future generation networks","imperfect CSI","particle swarm optimization","ant colony optimization","information propagation technique","novel detection algorithm","nonerroneous symbol detection","imperfect channel state information","sub-optimal performance","successive interference cancellation detectors","minimum mean square error successive interference cancellation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Social Spider Optimization Algorithm","large MIMO Detection","Maximum likelihood"]}],"abstract":"To meet the ever growing demand of high data rates and high spectral efficiency of future generation networks, multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system is a key technique in wireless communication systems. However, design of an efficient low complexity detector for MIMO systems is a challenging research problem. Conventional MIMO detection techniques like zero forcing, minimum mean square error, minimum mean square error successive interference cancellation and minimum mean square error ordered successive interference cancellation detectors provide only sub-optimal performance and are not robust under imperfect channel state information (CSI) at the receiver. Hence, development of robust and efficient detection algorithms are necessary for non-erroneous symbol detection in MIMO systems. In this work, a novel detection algorithm for large MIMO systems is proposed inspired by social foraging behavior of Spiders, which uses a information propagation technique to provide improved performance than several well-studied meta-heuristic techniques like ant colony optimization and particle swarm optimization. Simulation results reveal that the proposed detection technique outperforms conventional detection techniques under both perfect and imperfect CSI at the receiver. The superior performance of the proposed algorithm under imperfect CSI at the receiver validates robustness of the algorithm.","doi":"10.1109/ANTS.2017.8384183","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Advanced Networks and Telecommunications Systems (ANTS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Advanced Networks and Telecommunications Systems (ANTS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8374003/8384083/08384183.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ANTS.2017.8384183","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8384083","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Social spider optimizer based large MIMO detector","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8384183","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-20 Dec. 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8384183/","displayDocTitle":"Social spider optimizer based large MIMO detector","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2017","accessionNumber":"17856667","htmlLink":"/document/8384183/","conferenceDate":"17-20 Dec. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"14 June 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Social spider optimizer based large MIMO detector","confLoc":"Bhubaneswar, India","sourcePdf":"AuthorsPaper91ANTS2017.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063941S","chronDate":"17-20 Dec. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8374003","isNumber":"8384083","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8374003","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8384083","articleId":"8384183","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8384186,"authors":[{"name":"Sachin Sharma","affiliation":["Systems Engineering, University of Arkansas at Little Rock, Little Rock, Arkansas"],"firstName":"Sachin","lastName":"Sharma","id":"37085998776"},{"name":"M.

This paper concentrates on the concern related to spectrum sharing in cognitive radio networks (CRN) such that radio frequency can have an effective usage among licensed and unlicensed users. The paper formulates an auction-based spectrum allocation mechanism where bids for available bands are collected from secondary users and the primary owner decides upon the channel allocation while being restricted to single-unit-single-user allocation constraint and avoiding any harmful interference. A sequential bidding policy is deployed during the game that incorporates the winner determination and pricing strategies.

Over the huge set of parameters characterizing the design space (such as the number of intermediate hubs and the sensors transmission range), we analyze such a trade-off when the placements of the hubs are not completely random but aim at promoting diversity between the subsets of readings considered by each hub. With respect to the case of no intermediate data aggregation, numerical evidence suggests that when an appropriate design strategy for the CS stage is adopted and diversity is promoted, an energy savings higher than 60% with high-quality signal reconstruction can be obtained. This operative point corresponds to 20 intermediate hubs deployed to collect reading from 128 sensors.","doi":"10.1109/JETCAS.2018.2846884","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8571018","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JETCAS.2018.2846884","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Emerging and Selected Topics in Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Emerging and Selected Topics in Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/5503868/8571018/08384224.pdf","startPage":"895","endPage":"907","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Administering Quality-Energy Trade-Off in IoT Sensing Applications by Means of Adapted Compressed Sensing","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 June 2018","displayDocTitle":"Administering Quality-Energy Trade-Off in IoT Sensing Applications by Means of Adapted Compressed Sensing","volume":"8","issue":"4","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2018","dateOfInsertion":"17 December 2018","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8384224/","publicationDate":"Dec. 2018","accessionNumber":"18329019","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8384224/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Administering Quality-Energy Trade-Off in IoT Sensing Applications by Means of Adapted Compressed Sensing","sourcePdf":"jetcas-mangia-2846884-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.209243S","chronDate":"Dec.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"5503868","isNumber":"8571018","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5503868","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8571018","articleId":"8384224","onlineDate":"13 June 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-08-21"},{"_id":8384227,"authors":[{"name":"Mohsen Moradi Dalvand","affiliation":["Institute for Intelligent Systems Research and Innovation, Deakin University, Geelong, VIC, Australia"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/8274985/8384227/dalva-2844563-small.gif","p":["Mohsen Moradi Dalvand received the Ph.D. degree in mechanical engineering from Monash University, Australia.

Conventional far-end crosstalk (FEXT)-based cancellers falter in the upstream transmission of this emerging G.fast system. In this paper, we propose a novel differential evolution algorithm (DEA)aided turbo channel estimation (CE) and a multi-user detection (MUD) scheme for the G.fast upstream, including the frequency band up to 212 MHz, which is capable of approaching the optimal Cramer-Rao lower bound of the channel estimate, whilst approaching the optimal maximum likelihood MUD's performance associated with perfect channel state information and, yet, only imposing about 5% of its computational complexity. Explicitly, the turbo concept is exploited by iteratively exchanging information between the continuous value-based DEA-assisted channel estimator and the discrete value-based DEA MUD. Our extensive simulations show that 18-dB normalized mean square error gain is attained by the channel estimator and 10-dB signal-to-noise ratio gain can be achieved by the MUD upon exploiting this iteration gain. We also quantify the influence of the CE error, the copper length, and the impulse noise. This paper demonstrates that the proposed DEA-aided turbo CE and MUD scheme is capable of offering near-capacity performance at an affordable complexity for the emerging G.fast systems.","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2847232","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8274985","startPage":"33111","endPage":"33128","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/8274985/08384232.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2847232","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Differential Evolution Algorithm Aided Turbo Channel Estimation and Multi-User Detection for G.Fast Systems in the Presence of FEXT","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multiuser detection","Channel estimation","Crosstalk","DSL","Computational complexity","Precoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","computational complexity","digital subscriber lines","iterative methods","maximum likelihood estimation","mean square error methods","multiuser detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","optimal Cramer-Rao lower bound","far-end crosstalk","normalized mean square error gain","optimal maximum likelihood MUD performance","turbo channel estimation","signal-to-noise ratio gain","differential evolution algorithm","MUD scheme","DEA-aided turbo CE","discrete value-based DEA MUD","continuous value-based DEA-assisted channel estimator","perfect channel state information","multiuser detection scheme","upstream transmission","far-end crosstalk-based cancellers","digital subscriber line","broadband Internet access","FEXT","G.fast systems","frequency 106.0 MHz to 212.0 MHz"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Digital subscriber line","far-end crosstalk","G.fast upstream","vectoring","turbo channel estimation and multi-user detection","differential evolution algorithm"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"2018","displayDocTitle":"Differential Evolution Algorithm Aided Turbo Channel Estimation and Multi-User Detection for G.Fast Systems in the Presence of FEXT","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8384232/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 June 2018","dateOfInsertion":"06 May 2019","volume":"6","isOpenAccess":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8384232/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"17886063","publicationDate":"2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"European Research Council\u2019s Advanced Fellow Grant"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000288","fundingName":"Royal Society"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000266","fundingName":"Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council","grantNumber":"EP/N004558/1"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Differential Evolution Algorithm Aided Turbo Channel Estimation and Multi-User Detection for G.Fast Systems in the Presence of FEXT","sourcePdf":"access-hanzo-2847232-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.137257S","chronDate":"2018","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"8274985","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"8274985","articleId":"8384232","onlineDate":"13 June 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8384234,"authors":[{"name":"Fayu Wan","affiliation":["Nanjing University of Information Science and Technology, Nanjing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/8274985/8384234/wan-2845411-small.gif","p":["Fayu Wan (M\u201918) received the Ph.D. degree in electronic engineering from the University of Rouen, Rouen, France, in 2011.

The methodology for characterizing this unfamiliar NGD function is described. The basic NGD topology under study is typically an active cell composed of an RF low-noise amplifier (LNA) and an RL-series passive network. It acts as a low-pass NGD topology. The family of the bandpass NGD cell is identified from the low-pass to the bandpass transform. The NGD circuit theory under study is essentially built with the S-parameter approach. The main characteristics of the proposed NGD topology and properties of the NGD level, cut-off frequencies or bandwidth, central frequency, and figure-of-merit are established. The NGD cell is synthesized using the LNA S-parameter model. A method for designing the lowand bandpass NGD cells as a function of the specified NGD values is presented. The NGD cell parameter calculations as functions of the expected NGD level, insertion loss, and reflection coefficient are introduced. Proof-of-concept NGDs are synthesized, designed, simulated, and fabricated to understand and validate the proposed NGD low-pass and bandpass functions. As expected, low-pass and bandpass NGD aspects are obtained. The low-pass NGD circuits present an NGD level of approximately -5 ns over the bandwidth fc = 25 MHz. Next, bandpass NGD circuits were synthesized to operate at approximately 0.5 GHz over the bandwidth \u0394f = 50 MHz with an NGD level of approximately -10 ns. The measured results of the low-pass and bandpass NGD are in good agreement with the theoretical prediction obtained with simple lumped circuits. Different applications of the unfamiliar NGD function are described.","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2845411","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2845411","startPage":"33849","endPage":"33858","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/8274985/08384234.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8274985","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The Design Method of the Active Negative Group Delay Circuits Based on a Microwave Amplifier and an RL-Series Network","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 June 2018","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"2018","displayDocTitle":"The Design Method of the Active Negative Group Delay Circuits Based on a Microwave Amplifier and an RL-Series Network","publicationDate":"2018","dateOfInsertion":"04 July 2018","volume":"6","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8384234/","isOpenAccess":true,"accessionNumber":"17886064","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8384234/","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61601233 and 61750110535"},{"fundingName":"Defense Research Foundation","grantNumber":"6140209050116ZK53001"},{"fundingName":"NSF of Jiangsu","grantNumber":"BK20150918"},{"fundingName":"Jiangsu Innovation and Enterprise Group Talents Plan 2015","grantNumber":"SRCB201526"},{"fundingName":"PAPD"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"The Design Method of the Active Negative Group Delay Circuits Based on a Microwave Amplifier and an RL-Series Network","sourcePdf":"access-wan-2845411-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.076336S","chronDate":"2018","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"8274985","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"8274985","articleId":"8384234","onlineDate":"13 June 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":8384238,"authors":[{"name":"Dongming Li","affiliation":["School of Internet of Things, Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Nanjing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/8274985/8384238/li-2846764-small.gif","p":["Dongming Li received the Ph.D. degree in communication and information systems from the Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China, in 2014.

With the intensive research into full-duplex communication technologies, the licensed spectrum available for CR-based SGs (CR-SGs) may be more complex and difficult to use, as more primary traffic exists on the licensed spectrum. As a result, CR-SGs may experience more severe interference from primary users (PUs), and the corresponding transmission opportunities may be impaired. In this paper, based on distinctive polarization features of samples from different PUs, the signal polarization of each PU is extracted from the hybrid samples by studying the polarization similarity of the samples. Based on the signal polarization derived for each PU, the transmitting opportunities for CR-SGs can be derived. Both the interference from CR-SGs to PUs and the throughput of CR-SGs are examined. Numerical results show that the spectrum opportunities for CR-SGs can be guaranteed and that the interference inflicted on PUs is at a satisfactory level.","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2846764","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/8274985/08384238.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8274985","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2846764","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","startPage":"33088","endPage":"33098","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cognitive Radio-Based Smart Grids: From the Perspective of Full-Duplex Primary Users","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8384238","topic":"Human-Centered Smart Systems and Technologies","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2018","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 June 2018","displayDocTitle":"Cognitive Radio-Based Smart Grids: From the Perspective of Full-Duplex Primary Users","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8384238/","volume":"6","htmlLink":"/document/8384238/","isJournal":true,"isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"2018","accessionNumber":"17886065","dateOfInsertion":"04 July 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61601244, 61702282, 61672299 and 61502250"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004608","fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province","grantNumber":"BK20160899 and BK20140883"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100010246","fundingName":"Postdoctoral Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province","grantNumber":"1701168B"},{"fundingName":"NUPTSF","grantNumber":"NY214190 and NY215126"},{"fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of the Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions","grantNumber":"17KJB520023"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Cognitive Radio-Based Smart Grids: From the Perspective of Full-Duplex Primary Users","sourcePdf":"access-li-2846764-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.073151S","chronDate":"2018","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"8274985","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8274985","topics":["Human-Centered Smart Systems and Technologies"],"articleId":"8384238","onlineDate":"13 June 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8384243,"authors":[{"name":"Kalpesh A.

In order to exploit the inherent unbalancing of UDNs as an advantage in exploiting the most benefits from BESS, a phase-sensitive day-ahead dispatch strategy for BESS is proposed. The objectives incorporated in the proposed multiobjective, multiperiod optimization include a) maximizing peak shaving, b) improving voltage profile, c) loss minimization, d) reducing tap changer operations of voltage regulators, and e) minimizing discharge-recharge cycles. A two-stage fuzzy multiobjective optimization platform is developed to 1) represent uncertainty in load demand, 2) incorporate a human-friendly linguistic interface, and 3) provide flexibility to operator for changing priorities as a function of time. A novel application of max-average and max-product compositions in fuzzy systems is employed for multiperiod optimization. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is tested on an IEEE 37-node standard test feeder with comparative results of phase-balanced and phase-sensitive BESS dispatch. It is further validated on a feeder in Northwest USA with an existing BESS. Single-objective and multiobjective optimization results with multiple Pareto solutions demonstrate the stability and robustness of the proposed approach.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Minimization","Optimization","Energy storage","Voltage control","Fuzzy methods","Power demand","Energy loss"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["battery storage plants","distribution networks","fuzzy set theory","Pareto optimisation","power generation dispatch","power generation scheduling","power grids","stochastic programming"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["tap changer operation reduction","multiobjective optimization results","phase-sensitive BESS dispatch","phase-balanced","IEEE 37-node standard test feeder","fuzzy systems","max-product compositions","human-friendly linguistic interface","two-stage fuzzy multiobjective optimization platform","voltage regulators","loss minimization","maximizing peak shaving","multiperiod optimization","phase-sensitive day-ahead dispatch strategy","battery energy storage systems","distributed generation","active resources","optimum utilization","UDN","unbalanced distribution network","battery energy storage system"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Battery energy storage systems (BESSs)","dispatch of BESS","fuzzy multiobjective optimization (FMOO)","unbalanced distribution networks (UDNs)"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8384243","doi":"10.1109/JSYST.2018.2829124","startPage":"3649","endPage":"3660","publicationTitle":"IEEE Systems Journal","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Systems Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/4267003/8543256/08384243.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8543256","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSYST.2018.2829124","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 June 2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8384243/","displayDocTitle":"A Two-Stage Fuzzy Multiobjective Optimization for Phase-Sensitive Day-Ahead Dispatch of Battery Energy Storage System","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2018","volume":"12","issue":"4","publicationDate":"Dec. 2018","dateOfInsertion":"22 November 2018","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"18281217","htmlLink":"/document/8384243/","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Indian Institute of Technology Gandhinagar"},{"fundingName":"Department of Science and Technology, Government of India","grantNumber":"SERB/F/4835/2012-2013"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Two-Stage Fuzzy Multiobjective Optimization for Phase-Sensitive Day-Ahead Dispatch of Battery Energy Storage System","sourcePdf":"jsyst-joshi-2829124-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.198259S","chronDate":"Dec.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"4267003","isNumber":"8543256","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4267003","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8543256","articleId":"8384243","onlineDate":"13 June 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8384265,"authors":[{"name":"Yue Liu","affiliation":["Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University of Sheffield, Sheffield, U.K."],"firstName":"Yue","lastName":"Liu","orcid":"0000-0002-0348-5344","id":"37086095453"},{"name":"H.

However, driver-machine conflicts and uncertain driver/external disturbances are significant problems in cooperative steering systems, which degrade the system's path-tracking ability and reduce driving safety. This paper proposes a novel stochastic game-based shared control framework to model the steering torque interaction between the driver and the intelligent electric power steering (IEPS) system. A six-order driver-vehicle dynamic system, including driver/external uncertainty, is established for path-tracking. Then, the affine linear-quadratic-based path-tracking problem is proposed to model the maneuvers of the driver and IEPS. Particularly, the feedback Nash and Stackelberg frameworks to the affine-quadratic problem are derived by stochastic dynamic programming. Two cases of copilot lane change driving scenarios are studied via computer simulation. The intrinsic relation between the stochastic Nash and Stackelberg strategies is investigated based on the results. And the steering-in-the-loop experiment reveals the potential of the proposed shared control framework in handling driver-IEPS conflicts and uncertain driver/external turbulence. Finally, the copiloting experiments with a human driver further demonstrate the rationality of the game-based pattern between both the agents.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/41/8556518/08384269.pdf","startPage":"3093","endPage":"3105","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2018.2844784","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2018.2844784","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8556518","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8384269","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Shared Steering Torque Control for Lane Change Assistance: A Stochastic Game-Theoretic Approach","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Vehicles","Stochastic processes","Control systems","Steering systems","Torque","Vehicle dynamics","Safety"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dynamic programming","feedback","game theory","linear quadratic control","path planning","road safety","road vehicles","steering systems","stochastic games","stochastic processes","torque control","vehicle dynamics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["human-machine copilot","stochastic game-based method","driving safety","steering systems","uncertain driver/external disturbances","driver-machine conflicts","challenging issue","stochastic game-theoretic approach","lane change assistance","shared steering torque control","game-based pattern","human driver","copiloting experiments","uncertain driver/external turbulence","driver-IEPS conflicts","steering-in-the-loop experiment","copilot lane change","stochastic dynamic programming","affine-quadratic problem","affine linear-quadratic-based path-tracking problem","driver/external uncertainty","six-order driver-vehicle dynamic system","intelligent electric power steering system","steering torque interaction"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Affine-quadratic game","driver\u2013machine conflicting","shared steering control","stochastic dynamic programming"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8384269/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2019","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 June 2018","displayDocTitle":"Shared Steering Torque Control for Lane Change Assistance: A Stochastic Game-Theoretic Approach","volume":"66","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/8384269/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"April 2019","accessionNumber":"18292262","dateOfInsertion":"03 December 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"U1664263 and 51375009"},{"fundingName":"Tsinghua University initiative Scientific Research Program","grantNumber":"2014z21039"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Shared Steering Torque Control for Lane Change Assistance: A Stochastic Game-Theoretic Approach","sourcePdf":"tie-liu-2844784-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.104929S","chronDate":"April  2019","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"8556518","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"8556518","articleId":"8384269","onlineDate":"13 June 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-02"},{"_id":8384285,"authors":[{"name":"Jun Zhu","affiliation":["Department of Industrial Systems Engineering and Management, Sembcorp-NUS Corporate Laboratory, Faculty of Engineering, National University of Singapore, Singapore"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/8556518/8384285/zhu-2844856-small.gif","p":["Jun Zhu received the B.S. degree in mechanical design manufacture and\n automation from Huazhong Agricultural University, Wuhan, China, in 2013, and the M.S. degree in mechatronic\n engineering from the University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, China, in 2016.

In this paper, we present a new deep feature learning method for RUL estimation approach through time frequency representation (TFR) and multiscale convolutional neural network (MSCNN). TFR can reveal nonstationary property of a bearing degradation signal effectively. After acquiring time-series degradation signals, we get TFRs, which contain plenty of useful information using wavelet transform. Owing to high dimensionality, the size of these TFRs is reduced by bilinear interpolation, which are further regarded as inputs for deep learning models. Here, we introduce an MSCNN model structure, which keeps the global and local information synchronously compared to a traditional convolutional neural network (CNN). The salient features, which contribute for RUL estimation, can be learned automatically by MSCNN. The effectiveness of the presented method is validated by the experiment data. Compared to traditional data-driven and different CNN-based feature extraction methods, the proposed method shows enhanced performance in the prediction accuracy.","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2018.2844856","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/41/8556518/08384285.pdf","startPage":"3208","endPage":"3216","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8556518","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2018.2844856","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Estimation of Bearing Remaining Useful Life Based on Multiscale Convolutional Neural Network","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8384285","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2019","displayDocTitle":"Estimation of Bearing Remaining Useful Life Based on Multiscale Convolutional Neural Network","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8384285/","publicationDate":"April 2019","dateOfInsertion":"03 December 2018","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"18292259","htmlLink":"/document/8384285/","volume":"66","issue":"4","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 June 2018","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"National Research Foundation, Sembcorp Industries Ltd."},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001352","fundingName":"National University of Singapore"},{"fundingName":"Sembcorp-NUS Corporate Laboratory","grantNumber":"R-261-513-003-281"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Estimation of Bearing Remaining Useful Life Based on Multiscale Convolutional Neural Network","sourcePdf":"tie-zhu-2844856-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.103757S","chronDate":"April  2019","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"8556518","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"67","xplore-issue":"8556518","articleId":"8384285","onlineDate":"13 June 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8384287,"authors":[{"name":"Andr\u00e9s Mora","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Universidad T\u00e9cnica Federico Santa Mar\u00eda, Valpara\u00edso, Chile"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/8519637/8384287/mora-2844842-small.gif","p":["Andr\u00e9s Mora (M\u201917) was born in Santiago, Chile.

Both balancing schemes are based on model predictive control and are designed to efficiently solve a constrained optimal control problem, where the predicted capacitor voltage errors are included in the cost function with the demanded output voltage of a cluster being forced through an equality constraint. The first method proposed in this paper computes specific modulation indexes for each module using the explicit solution of a relaxed version of the original optimization problem. The second approach proposed in this paper reduces the complexity of the original problem by linearizing the objective function and using an optimal sorting network based on a greedy algorithm to solve this approximation. Considering the structures of both solution approaches, they are integrated into modulation schemes based on phase-shifted and level-shifted pulsewidth modulation algorithms, respectively. Experimental results obtained from a nine-cell single-phase MMC prototype demonstrate the good performance achieved with the proposed methodologies, as well as the implementation simplicity offered by the proposed CVB algorithms.","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2018.2844842","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/41/8519637/08384287.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2018.2844842","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8519637","startPage":"2432","endPage":"2443","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Model-Predictive-Control-Based Capacitor Voltage Balancing Strategies for Modular Multilevel Converters","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8384287","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Model-Predictive-Control-Based Capacitor Voltage Balancing Strategies for Modular Multilevel Converters","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2019","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8384287/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 June 2018","isJournal":true,"volume":"66","issue":"3","publicationDate":"March 2019","accessionNumber":"18199314","dateOfInsertion":"01 November 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8384287/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Fondecyt Chile","grantNumber":"1180879 and 11170229"},{"fundingName":"Conicyt Grant CONICYT-PCHA/Doctorado Nacional","grantNumber":"2013-21130042"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Model-Predictive-Control-Based Capacitor Voltage Balancing Strategies for Modular Multilevel Converters","sourcePdf":"tie-mora-2844842-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.108636S","chronDate":"March  2019","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"8519637","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"8519637","articleId":"8384287","onlineDate":"13 June 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8384293,"authors":[{"name":"Guoqian Jiang","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Yanshan University, Qihuangdao, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/8556518/8384293/jiang-2844805-small.gif","p":["Guoqian Jiang (M\u201918) received the B.S. degree in measurement\n control technology and instrumentation and the Ph.D. degree in control science and engineering from Yanshan\n University, Qinhuangdao, China, in 2011 and 2018, respectively.","He was a joint Ph.D. student with the Department of Electrical, Computer, and Biomedical Engineering, University of\n Rhode Island, Kingston, RI, USA, from 2015 to 2017.

Unlike traditional approaches, where feature extraction and classification are separately designed and performed, this paper aims to automatically learn effective fault features directly from raw vibration signals while classify the type of faults in a single framework, thus providing an end-to-end learning-based fault diagnosis system for WT gearbox without additional signal processing and diagnostic expertise. Considering the multiscale characteristics inherent in vibration signals of a gearbox, a new multiscale convolutional neural network (MSCNN) architecture is proposed to perform multiscale feature extraction and classification simultaneously. The proposed MSCNN incorporates multiscale learning into the traditional CNN architecture, which has two merits: 1) high-level fault features can be effectively learned by the hierarchical learning structure with multiple pairs of convolutional and pooling layers; and 2) multiscale learning scheme can capture complementary and rich diagnosis information at different scales. This greatly improves the feature learning ability and enables better diagnosis performance. The proposed MSCNN approach is evaluated through experiments on a WT gearbox test rig. Experimental results and comprehensive comparison analysis with respect to the traditional CNN and traditional multiscale feature extractors have demonstrated the superiority of the proposed method.","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2018.2844805","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2018.2844805","startPage":"3196","endPage":"3207","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/41/8556518/08384293.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8556518","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multiscale Convolutional Neural Networks for Fault Diagnosis of Wind Turbine Gearbox","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8384293/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2019","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 June 2018","displayDocTitle":"Multiscale Convolutional Neural Networks for Fault Diagnosis of Wind Turbine Gearbox","volume":"66","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"03 December 2018","accessionNumber":"18292258","publicationDate":"April 2019","htmlLink":"/document/8384293/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61673336"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003787","fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of Hebei Province","grantNumber":"F2018203413 and F2016203421"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multiscale Convolutional Neural Networks for Fault Diagnosis of Wind Turbine Gearbox","sourcePdf":"tie-he-2844805-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.133926S","chronDate":"April  2019","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"8556518","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"90","xplore-issue":"8556518","articleId":"8384293","onlineDate":"13 June 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8384302,"authors":[{"name":"Jian-Xun Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Automation, Xi\u2019an Research Institute of High-Tech, Xi\u2019an, China"],"bio":{"p":["Jian-Xun Zhang received the B.Eng. degree in control science and engineering and M.Eng. degree in instrument science and technology from the Xi\u2019an Institute of High-Tech, Xi\u2019an, China, in 2011 and 2013, respectively.

The key issue for prognostics of such systems is to account for the impact of the changing-point variability and the associated degradation state at this point on the progression of the degradation process. However, current studies usually treat the degradation state at the change point as a fixed value rather a random variable. Thus, it is still challenging to predict the lifetime of such multi-phase degrading systems. To this end, we first formulate a general degradation modeling framework based on a two-phase Wiener process. In prognostics, we take into full account the uncertainty of the degradation state at the changing point and then derive the analytical expressions of the lifetime and remaining useful life under the concept of the first passage time. The derived results are distinguished from existing results limited to the fixed state at the changing point. Furthermore, we extend our approach and results to cases with unit-to-unit variability and multiple phases. To facilitate the model implementation, we propose both offline and online methods for parameter identification, which make full use of the historical data and the in-service data. Finally, a numerical simulation and a practical case study are provided for illustration.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8384302/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 June 2018","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2019","publicationDate":"June 2019","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8384302/","dateOfInsertion":"31 May 2019","accessionNumber":"18725614","volume":"68","issue":"2","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A Novel Lifetime Estimation Method for Two-Phase Degrading Systems","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61573365, 61025014, 61490701, 61751307, 61473094 and 61703244"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100010040","fundingName":"Taishan Scholar Project of Shandong Province","grantNumber":"LZB2015-162"},{"fundingName":"National Key Research and Development Program of China","grantNumber":"2017YFA0700300"},{"fundingName":"NSFC","grantNumber":"61733009, 61522309 and 61473163"},{"fundingName":"Fund of Suzhou-Tsinghua Innovation Leading Action","grantNumber":"2016SZ0202"},{"fundingName":"NSFC","grantNumber":"61773386"},{"fundingName":"Young Elite Scientists Sponsorship Program"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100010097","fundingName":"China Association for Science and Technology","grantNumber":"2016QNRC001"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Novel Lifetime Estimation Method for Two-Phase Degrading Systems","sourcePdf":"tr-zhou-2829844-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.126154S","chronDate":"June  2019","xplore-pub-id":"24","isNumber":"8727549","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"24","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"8727549","articleId":"8384302","onlineDate":"13 June 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-09"},{"_id":8384307,"authors":[{"name":"Hongcai Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, University of California at Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6687316/8468135/8384307/zhang-2847244-small.gif","p":["Hongcai Zhang (S\u201914\u2013M\u201918) received the B.S. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, in 2013 and 2018, respectively.","From 2016 to 2017, he was a Visiting Student Researcher with the Energy, Controls, and Applications Laboratory, University of California at Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, USA, where he is currently a Post-Doctoral Scholar.

This paper proposes a multidisciplinary approach to jointly plan PEV charging stations and distributed photovoltaic (PV) power plants on a coupled transportation and power network. We formulate a two-stage stochastic programming model to determine the sites and sizes of: 1) PEV charging stations and 2) PV power plants. This proposed method incorporates comprehensive models of: 1) transportation networks with explicit PEV driving range constraints; 2) PEV charging stations with probabilistic quality of service constraints; 3) PV power generation with reactive power control; and 4) alternating current distribution power flow. The formulation results in a mixed-integer second-order cone program. We then design a generalized Benders decomposition algorithm to efficiently solve it. Numerical experiments show that investing in distributed PV power plants with PEV charging stations has multiple benefits, e.g., reducing social costs, promoting renewable power integration, and alleviating power congestion. The benefits become more prominent when utilizing PV generation with reactive power control, which can also help to enhance power supply quality.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8468135","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TTE.2018.2847244","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Transportation

reduces bit rates over the preceding H.264 standard but at the expense of extremely high encoding complexity. In HEVC, the quad-tree partition of the coding unit (CU) consumes a large proportion of the HEVC encoding complexity, due to the brute-force search for rate-distortion optimization (RDO). Therefore, this paper proposes a deep learning approach to predict the CU partition for reducing the HEVC complexity at both intra-and inter-modes, which is based on convolutional neural network (CNN) and long- and short-term memory (LSTM) network. First, we establish a large-scale database including substantial CU partition data for the HEVC intra- and inter-modes. This enables deep learning on the CU partition. Second, we represent the CU partition of an entire coding tree unit in the form of a hierarchical CU partition map (HCPM). Then, we propose an early terminated hierarchical CNN (ETH-CNN) for learning to predict the HCPM. Consequently, the encoding complexity of intra-mode HEVC can be drastically reduced by replacing the brute-force search with ETH-CNN to decide the CU partition. Third, an ETH-LSTM is proposed to learn the temporal correlation of the CU partition. Then, we combine the ETH-LSTM and the ETH-CNN to predict the CU partition for reducing the HEVC complexity at inter-mode. Finally, experimental results show that our approach outperforms the other state-of-the-art approaches in reducing the HEVC complexity at both intra- and inter-modes.","doi":"10.1109/TIP.2018.2847035","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/83/8396881/08384310.pdf","startPage":"5044","endPage":"5059","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIP.2018.2847035","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8396881","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reducing Complexity of HEVC: A Deep Learning Approach","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8384310","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 June 2018","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8384310/","displayDocTitle":"Reducing Complexity of HEVC: A Deep Learning Approach","volume":"27","issue":"10","publicationDate":"Oct. 2018","accessionNumber":"17906181","pubMedId":"29994256","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8384310/","dateOfInsertion":"12 July 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61573037 and 61702028"},{"fundingName":"Fok Ying-Tong Education Foundation","grantNumber":"151061"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reducing Complexity of HEVC: A Deep Learning Approach","sourcePdf":"tip-xu-2847035-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.185585S","chronDate":"Oct.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"83","isNumber":"8396881","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"69","xplore-issue":"8396881","articleId":"8384310","onlineDate":"13 June 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-30"},{"_id":8384342,"authors":[{"name":"Gabriel Otero P\u00e9rez","affiliation":["Universidad Carlos III de Madrid, Madrid, Madrid, ES"],"firstName":"Gabriel Otero","lastName":"P\u00e9rez"},{"name":"Jos\u00e9 Alberto Hern\u00e1ndez","affiliation":["Universidad Carlos III de Madrid, Madrid, Madrid, ES"],"firstName":"Jos\u00e9 Alberto","lastName":"Hern\u00e1ndez"},{"name":"David Larrabeiti","affiliation":["Universidad Carlos III de Madrid, Madrid, Madrid, ES"],"firstName":"David","lastName":"Larrabeiti"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1943-0620"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1943-0639"}],"articleNumber":"8384342","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":27,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1103},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Delays","5G mobile communication","Multiplexing","Optical packet switching","Optical switches","Optimized production technology","Next generation networking"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["5G mobile communication","cellular radio","local area networks","next generation networks","packet switching","queueing theory","radio receivers","radio transmitters","statistical multiplexing","switching networks","telecommunication traffic","transponders","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["front-haul network dimensioning","fronthaul network modeling","fronthaul traffic","next-generation cellular networks","cloud radio access network architecture","statistical multiplexing gains","radio channels","high queuing delay percentiles","G-G-1 queuing model","evolved common public radio interface fronthaul","dimensioning meeting ultralow latency requirements","fifth-generation network","5G network","C-RAN architecture","cost reduction","Ethernet-based packet-switch networks","Kingman exponential law","high-speed transponders","frequency 40.0 MHz","frequency 100.0 MHz","frequency 10.0 MHz to 20.0 MHz"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["5G","C-RAN","Delay percentiles","eCPRI","Fronthaul networks","G/G/1","Kingman's exponential law of congestion"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8384342","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE/OSA Journal of Optical Communications and Networking","pdfPath":"/iel7/4563700/8384338/08384342.pdf","startPage":"573","endPage":"581","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1364/JOCN.10.000573","doi":"10.1364/JOCN.10.000573","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8384338","publicationTitle":"IEEE/OSA Journal of Optical Communications and Networking","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fronthaul network modeling and dimensioning meeting ultra-low latency requirements for 5G","abstract":"Enabling the transport of fronthaul traffic in next-generation cellular networks [fifth-generation (5G)] following the cloud radio access network (C-RAN) architecture requires a redesign of the fronthaul network featuring high capacity and ultra-low latency.

Although the C-RAN has reduced cost and complexity, high data rate fronthaul links are necessary. In this paper, we investigate the joint design of wireless fronthaul networks using both radio frequency (RF) and radio-over-free-space optical (RoFSO) links in the uplink of a C-RAN. Unlike earlier work which focuses on performance characterization of RF/FSO fronthaul networks, this paper presents a novel optimization approach to jointly design the quantizers for the RF fronthaul links and the amplifier gains of the RoFSO fronthaul links which suffer from clipping distortion. A subset of RUs fronthaul data via radio links using Wyner-Ziv source coding subject to a shared sum capacity constraint, while other RUs employ RoFSO fronthaul which converts the incoming RF receptions to optical signals by analog modulation of a laser. The optimization problem jointly designs both RF front- haul and RoFSO fronthaul links to maximize the weighted sum user rates. Simulation results of a simple C-RAN using measured weather data for two locations demonstrate that adding RoFSO links results in drastic improvements in end user rates but requires careful design of RF and RoFSO fronthaul links.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"C-RAN uplink optimization using mixed radio and FSO fronthaul","publicationTitle":"Journal of Optical Communications and Networking","doi":"10.1364/JOCN.10.000603","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Optical Communications and Networking","pdfPath":"/iel7/4563700/8384338/08384425.pdf","startPage":"603","endPage":"612","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1364/JOCN.10.000603","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8384338","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8384425","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8384425/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 June 2018","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2018","displayDocTitle":"C-RAN uplink optimization using mixed radio and FSO fronthaul","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"10","issue":"6","dateOfInsertion":"13 June 2018","publicationDate":"June 2018","accessionNumber":"17839625","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"C-RAN uplink optimization using mixed radio and FSO fronthaul","sourcePdf":"603.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.042987S","chronDate":"June  2018","isNumber":"8384338","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4563700","citationCount":"9","articleId":"8384425","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8384444,"authors":[{"name":"Hoon Chung","affiliation":["Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute"],"firstName":"Hoon","lastName":"Chung","id":"37856736400"},{"name":"Yun Kyung Lee","affiliation":["Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute"],"firstName":"Yun Kyung","lastName":"Lee"},{"name":"Sung Joo Lee","affiliation":["Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute"],"firstName":"Sung Joo","lastName":"Lee"},{"name":"Jeon Gue Park","affiliation":["Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute"],"firstName":"Jeon Gue","lastName":"Park"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-3333-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-3332-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-3334-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2472-7695"}],"articleNumber":"8384444","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":148},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Feature extraction","Computational modeling","Convolution","Databases","Standardization","Convolutional neural networks","Correlation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["convolution","feature extraction","feedforward neural nets","natural language processing","vectors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["automatic spoken English fluency scoring","feature extraction","feature vectors","fluency score","input feature vector","model parameter optimization","fluency features","Korean-Spoken English Corpus","convolutional neural networks","general English fluency scoring"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Spoken English fluency assessment","con- volutional neural network"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we propose a spoken English fluency scoring using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to learn feature extraction and scoring model jointly from raw time-domain signal input. In general, automatic spoken English fluency scoring is composed feature extraction and a scoring model. Feature extraction is used to compute the feature vectors that are assumed to represent spoken English fluency, and the scoring model predicts the fluency score of an input feature vector. Although the conventional approach works well, there are issues regarding feature extraction and model parameter optimization. First, because the fluency features are computed based on human knowledge, some crucial representations that are included in a raw data corpus can be missed. Second, each parameter of the model is optimized separately, which can lead to suboptimal performance. To address these issues, we propose a CNN-based approach to extract fluency features directly from a raw data corpus without hand-crafted engineering and optimizes all model parameters jointly. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is evaluated using Korean-Spoken English Corpus.","publicationTitle":"2017 20th Conference of the Oriental Chapter of the International Coordinating Committee on Speech Databases and Speech I/O Systems and Assessment (O-COCOSDA)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 20th Conference of the Oriental Chapter of the International Coordinating Committee on Speech Databases and Speech I/O Systems and Assessment (O-COCOSDA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8373628/8384412/08384444.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Spoken English fluency scoring using convolutional neural networks","doi":"10.1109/ICSDA.2017.8384444","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8384412","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSDA.2017.8384444","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8384444","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8384444/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-3 Nov. 2017","displayDocTitle":"Spoken English fluency scoring using convolutional neural networks","dateOfInsertion":"14 June 2018","publicationDate":"Nov. 2017","accessionNumber":"17843422","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"1-3 Nov. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8384444/","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spoken English fluency scoring using convolutional neural networks","confLoc":"Seoul, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"12S217.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072464S","chronDate":"1-3 Nov. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8373628","isNumber":"8384412","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8373628","xplore-issue":"8384412","articleId":"8384444","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8384446,"authors":[{"name":"Youngmoon Jung","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, South Korea"],"firstName":"Youngmoon","lastName":"Jung","id":"37086398801"},{"name":"Younggwan Kim","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, South Korea"],"firstName":"Younggwan","lastName":"Kim","id":"37076146700"},{"name":"Hyungjun Lim","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, South Korea"],"firstName":"Hyungjun","lastName":"Lim","id":"37085777826"},{"name":"Hoirin Kim","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, South Korea"],"firstName":"Hoirin","lastName":"Kim","id":"37292763700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-3333-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-3332-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-3334-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2472-7695"}],"articleNumber":"8384446","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":355},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Filter banks","Training","Feature extraction","Microsoft Windows","Signal to noise ratio","Voice activity detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["acoustics","cepstral analysis","ear","feature extraction","neural nets","noise","speech recognition","voice activity detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["linear-scale filterbank","deep neural network","voice activity detection","Mel-scale features","Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients","speech recognition","feature extraction","linear-scale feature","linear-filterbank energy","LMFB energies","log Mel-filterbank energies","human ears process","sound types","DNN based VAD system","log linear-filterbank energy","LLFB energy","noise types"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Voice activity detection","deep neural network","linear-scale filterbank","Mel-scale filterbank","noise- independent training"]}],"abstract":"Voice activity detection (VAD) is an important preprocessing module in many speech applications. Choosing appropriate features and model structures is a significant challenge and an active area of current VAD research. Mel-scale features such as Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs) and log Mel-filterbank (LMFB) energies have been widely used in VAD as well as speech recognition. The reason for feature extraction in Mel- frequency scale to be one of the most popular methods is that it mimics how human ears process sound. However, for certain types of sound, in which important characteristics are reflected more in the high frequency range, a linear-scale in frequency may provide more information than the Mel- scale. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a deep neural network (DNN)-based VAD system using linear-scale feature. This study shows that the linear-scale feature, especially log linear-filterbank (LLFB) energy, can be used for the DNN-based VAD system and shows better performance than the LMFB for certain types of noise. Moreover, a combination of LMFB and LLFB can integrates both advantages of the two features.","doi":"10.1109/ICSDA.2017.8384446","publicationTitle":"2017 20th Conference of the Oriental Chapter of the International Coordinating Committee on Speech Databases and Speech I/O Systems and Assessment (O-COCOSDA)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 20th Conference of the Oriental Chapter of the International Coordinating Committee on Speech Databases and Speech I/O Systems and Assessment (O-COCOSDA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8373628/8384412/08384446.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSDA.2017.8384446","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8384412","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8384446","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Linear-scale filterbank for deep neural network-based voice activity detection","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-3 Nov. 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8384446/","displayDocTitle":"Linear-scale filterbank for deep neural network-based voice activity detection","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8384446/","publicationDate":"Nov. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"14 June 2018","conferenceDate":"1-3 Nov. 2017","accessionNumber":"17843420","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Linear-scale filterbank for deep neural network-based voice activity detection","confLoc":"Seoul, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"14S225.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063924S","chronDate":"1-3 Nov. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8373628","isNumber":"8384412","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8373628","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"8384412","articleId":"8384446","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8384449,"authors":[{"name":"Hui Bu","affiliation":["Beijing Shell Shell Technology Co.

In order to maintain both improved electrical and thermal properties, the composite of aluminum oxide and zinc oxide (AhO3+ZnO) nanoparticles was dispersed into soya bean oil, and a blend of sunflower and olive oil with percentage concentration of 0.005g/L to form the nanooils. The purpose of this research is to compare the findings of various tests such as, breakdown voltage, tan delta, flash point, pour point, water content, viscosity and FTIR, performed on nanooil samples before and after aging with that of mineral oil. In case of aged soya bean nano oil, the breakdown voltage, flash point and viscosity are 26%, 22% and 5% higher, and the pour point, water content and tan delta are 1%, 12% and 0.5% lesser than those in mineral oil, respectively.

All these results showed that the addition of Nanoparticles to the vegetable oil improved electrical and thermal properties more than mineral oil.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8384521/","conferenceDate":"9-10 April 2018","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-10 April 2018","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"17856871","dateOfInsertion":"14 June 2018","publicationDate":"April 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8384521/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Effect of nanoparticles on breakdown, aging and other properties of vegetable oil","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Effect of nanoparticles on breakdown, aging and other properties of vegetable oil","confLoc":"Mirpur Azad Kashmir, Pakistan","sourcePdf":"sulaimani24.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.080867S","chronDate":"9-10 April 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8375185","isNumber":"8384483","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8375185","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"8384483","articleId":"8384521","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-21"},{"_id":8384554,"authors":[{"name":"Vasily Zyuzin","affiliation":["Ural Federal University"],"firstName":"Vasily","lastName":"Zyuzin","id":"37086083624"},{"name":"Porshnev Sergey","affiliation":["Ural Federal University"],"firstName":"Porshnev","lastName":"Sergey","id":"37086399685"},{"name":"Andrey Mukhtarov","affiliation":["Ural Federal University"],"firstName":"Andrey","lastName":"Mukhtarov","id":"37086287580"},{"name":"Tatyana Chumarnaya","affiliation":["Ural Federal University"],"firstName":"Tatyana","lastName":"Chumarnaya","id":"37393497800"},{"name":"Olga Solovyova","affiliation":["Ural Federal University"],"firstName":"Olga","lastName":"Solovyova","id":"37393494900"},{"name":"Anastasia Bobkova","affiliation":["OOO \u201cIT-Med\u201d Ekaterinburg, Russia"],"firstName":"Anastasia","lastName":"Bobkova","id":"37086399705"},{"name":"Vladislav Myasnikov","affiliation":["Samara National Research University Samara, Russia"],"firstName":"Vladislav","lastName":"Myasnikov","id":"37086400384"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-4946-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-4947-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8384554","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":553},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image segmentation","Ultrasonic imaging","Heart","Data models","Biomedical imaging","Adaptation models","Convolutional neural networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biomedical ultrasonics","echocardiography","image segmentation","medical image processing","neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["left ventricular endocardial border","image processing","semiautomatic mode","automatic tracking","EchoCG-images","convolutional neural network Unet","LV segmentation","LV endocardial border","left ventricle endocardial border","two-dimensional ultrasound images","cardiology"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["segmentation","ultrasound images","left ventricle","deep learning","Unet"]}],"abstract":"Nowadays ultrasound studies of the heart, also called echocardiography (EchoCG), are widespread in modern cardiology. One of the most important steps in estimating the health of the heart is the tracking and segmentation of the left ventricular (LV) endocardial border from EchoCG, which is used for measuring the ejection fraction and assessing the regional wall motion [1]. The disadvantage of these methods is the necessity to apply image processing manually or in a semi-automatic mode, which requires special knowledge and skills. As a result, the issue of an automatic tracking and segmentation of the LV on EchoCG-images is an actual and practical problem. The capabilities of the fully trained model of the convolutional neural network Unet for automatic identification of the LV region are explored in this paper. The obtained accuracy of LV segmentation is up to 92.3%, which suggests the expediency of using Unet for automatic identification of the LV endocardial border on ultrasound images.","doi":"10.1109/USBEREIT.2018.8384554","publicationTitle":"2018 Ural Symposium on Biomedical Engineering, Radioelectronics and Information Technology (USBEREIT)","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 Ural Symposium on Biomedical Engineering, Radioelectronics and Information Technology (USBEREIT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8373577/8384529/08384554.pdf","startPage":"76","endPage":"78","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/USBEREIT.2018.8384554","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8384529","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8384554","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Identification of the left ventricle endocardial border on two-dimensional ultrasound images using the convolutional neural network Unet","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-8 May 2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8384554/","displayDocTitle":"Identification of the left ventricle endocardial border on two-dimensional ultrasound images using the convolutional neural network Unet","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8384554/","publicationDate":"May 2018","dateOfInsertion":"14 June 2018","conferenceDate":"7-8 May 2018","accessionNumber":"17843371","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Identification of the left ventricle endocardial border on two-dimensional ultrasound images using the convolutional neural network Unet","confLoc":"Yekaterinburg, Russia","sourcePdf":"p20.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04403S","chronDate":"7-8 May 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8373577","isNumber":"8384529","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8373577","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"8384529","articleId":"8384554","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8384584,"authors":[{"name":"Nikolai Safiullin","affiliation":["Department of IT and Automation, Ural Federal University, Ekaterinburg, Russia"],"firstName":"Nikolai","lastName":"Safiullin","id":"37086004280"},{"name":"Sergey Porshnev","affiliation":["Department of IT and Automation, Ural Federal University, Ekaterinburg, Russia"],"firstName":"Sergey","lastName":"Porshnev","id":"37085409699"},{"name":"Nathan Kleeorin","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical Engineering Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, Beer-Sheva, Israel"],"firstName":"Nathan","lastName":"Kleeorin","id":"37086274048"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-4946-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-4947-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8384584","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":76},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Predictive models","Generators","Time series analysis","Mathematical model","Numerical models","Estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["astronomical techniques","astronomy computing","autoregressive processes","data assimilation","neural nets","sunspots","time series"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["artificial neural network","dynamo model","modern methods","monthly forecast","total sunspot number time series","nonlinear autoregressive scheme","exo-genous input","corresponding model estimations","time-point","modern sunspot forecasting methods","monthly corrections","monthly sunspot numbers forecast"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["artificial neural network","time series forecast","sunspot numbers","solar activity","data analysis"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8384584","abstract":"In this paper we propose a novel method for a monthly forecast of the total sunspot number time series, based on the combination of a dynamo model with an artificial neural network.

However, it is still challenging to perform a force-sensitive pick-and-place task, unless a considerable number of sensors monitor the process. The predictive capability of failures in conventional robotic object-sorting systems are limited. Using fifteen force-torque samples from the University of California-Irvine (UCI) database, we demonstrate the viability of failure prediction using an unsupervised Machine Learning (ML)-based method, whose learning parameters were optimised via Genetic Algorithms (GAs). This hybrid algorithm was deployed for discriminating between manipulation failure and successful object placement. GA was used to avoid overfitting or overtraining. The proposed model could detect robotic manipulation failures with 91.95% classification accuracy, thus improving on the performance of previous classification methods. This study validates the use of GAs and unsupervised ML to predict the extent of success for force-sensitive object placement using information on forces and torques alone.","doi":"10.1109/ICCAR.2018.8384638","startPage":"22","endPage":"25","publicationTitle":"2018 4th International Conference on Control, Automation and Robotics (ICCAR)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCAR.2018.8384638","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8384628","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 4th International Conference on Control, Automation and Robotics (ICCAR)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8375183/8384628/08384638.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Genetic algorithms and unsupervised machine learning for predicting robotic manipulation failures for force-sensitive tasks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8384638/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Genetic algorithms and unsupervised machine learning for predicting robotic manipulation failures for force-sensitive tasks","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8384638/","accessionNumber":"17843679","publicationDate":"April 2018","dateOfInsertion":"14 June 2018","conferenceDate":"20-23 April 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-23 April 2018","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Genetic algorithms and unsupervised machine learning for predicting robotic manipulation failures for force-sensitive tasks","confLoc":"Auckland, New Zealand","sourcePdf":"2004.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.040728S","chronDate":"20-23 April 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8375183","isNumber":"8384628","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8375183","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"8384628","articleId":"8384638","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8384661,"authors":[{"name":"Seema Mallavalli","affiliation":["Dept. of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Louisiana at Lafayette, Lafayette, LA, USA"],"firstName":"Seema","lastName":"Mallavalli","id":"37086153407"},{"name":"Afef Fekih","affiliation":["Dept. of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Louisiana at Lafayette, Lafayette, LA, USA"],"firstName":"Afef","lastName":"Fekih","id":"37294939600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-6338-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-6337-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-6339-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8384661","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":213},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Unmanned aerial vehicles","Aerodynamics","Actuators","Robustness","Fault tolerant control","Stability analysis","Convergence"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["actuators","aircraft control","autonomous aerial vehicles","control system synthesis","fault tolerant control","Lyapunov methods","particle swarm optimisation","remotely operated vehicles","stability","variable structure systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["underactuated unmanned aerial vehicles","system dynamics","FAS subsystem","UAS subsystem","actuator faults","disturbances","under-actuated subsystem","nonsingular fast terminal sliding mode controller","SMC-based fault tolerant control design","NFTSMC","under-actuated sliding mode controller","USSMC","particle swarm optimization algorithm","PSO algorithm","quadrotor UAV'","Lyapunov approach"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["sliding mode control","fault tolerant control","UA V","PSO","UAS","actuator faults"]}],"abstract":"This paper proposes a fault tolerant control design for a class of under-actuated unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV).

Simulation results confirmed the tracking performance and robustness of the proposed approach.","doi":"10.1109/ICCAR.2018.8384661","publicationTitle":"2018 4th International Conference on Control, Automation and Robotics (ICCAR)","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 4th International Conference on Control, Automation and Robotics (ICCAR)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8375183/8384628/08384661.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCAR.2018.8384661","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8384628","startPage":"152","endPage":"155","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An SMC-based fault tolerant control design for a class of underactuated unmanned aerial vehicles","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8384661","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"An SMC-based fault tolerant control design for a class of underactuated unmanned aerial vehicles","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-23 April 2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8384661/","conferenceDate":"20-23 April 2018","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2018","accessionNumber":"17843726","dateOfInsertion":"14 June 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8384661/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An SMC-based fault tolerant control design for a class of underactuated unmanned aerial vehicles","confLoc":"Auckland, New Zealand","sourcePdf":"2027.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045837S","chronDate":"20-23 April 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8375183","isNumber":"8384628","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8375183","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8384628","articleId":"8384661","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8384667,"authors":[{"name":"Antonio Moran","affiliation":["Graduate School, Stockholm University, Sweden"],"firstName":"Antonio","lastName":"Moran","id":"37346736100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-6338-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-6337-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-6339-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8384667","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":108},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Heuristic algorithms","Task analysis","Training","Nonlinear dynamical systems","Neural networks","Control systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["learning (artificial intelligence)","mobile robots","neurocontrollers","nonlinear control systems","nonlinear dynamical systems","position control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["nonlinear dynamic systems","neural networks","straightforward learning scheme","dynamic control problems","incremental learning methods","Dynamic Back Propagation algorithm","incremental scheme","human learning","highly unstable nonlinear systems","positioning control","incremental learning strategies","mobile robots"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["recurrent neural networks","dynamic back propagation","neuro-control","incremental learning","mobile robots"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8384667","abstract":"Nonlinear dynamic systems present complex behavior that is not easy to control using conventional techniques. Even more, neural networks cannot always be trained in a straightforward learning scheme for solving dynamic control problems. This paper proposes incremental learning methods for training neural networks for the control of nonlinear dynamic systems using the Dynamic Back Propagation algorithm. By analyzing the complexity of the control problem, learning strategies are formulated in an incremental scheme similar to human learning: starting from easy and simple tasks and continuing with increasingly complex and difficult tasks. The results obtained in the control of highly unstable nonlinear systems, and the positioning control of mobile robots verify the effectiveness of the proposed incremental learning strategies.","doi":"10.1109/ICCAR.2018.8384667","pdfPath":"/iel7/8375183/8384628/08384667.pdf","startPage":"182","endPage":"189","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 4th International Conference on Control, Automation and Robotics (ICCAR)","publicationTitle":"2018 4th International Conference on Control, Automation and Robotics (ICCAR)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCAR.2018.8384667","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8384628","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Control of nonlinear dynamic systems using neural networks with incremental learning","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8384667/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-23 April 2018","displayDocTitle":"Control of nonlinear dynamic systems using neural networks with incremental learning","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"14 June 2018","accessionNumber":"17843678","publicationDate":"April 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8384667/","conferenceDate":"20-23 April 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Control of nonlinear dynamic systems using neural networks with incremental learning","confLoc":"Auckland, New Zealand","sourcePdf":"2033.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.082916S","chronDate":"20-23 April 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8375183","isNumber":"8384628","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8375183","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8384628","articleId":"8384667","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8384706,"authors":[{"name":"Zhe Liu","affiliation":["Auckland University of Technology, Auckland, New Zealand"],"firstName":"Zhe","lastName":"Liu","id":"37086398479"},{"name":"Wei Qi Yan","affiliation":["Auckland University of Technology, Auckland, New Zealand"],"firstName":"Wei Qi","lastName":"Yan","id":"37086398486"},{"name":"Mee Loong Yang","affiliation":["Auckland University of Technology, Auckland, New Zealand"],"firstName":"Mee Loong","lastName":"Yang","id":"37086399911"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-6338-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-6337-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-6339-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8384706","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1210},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Image denoising based on a CNN model","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8384706","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Filtering","Training","Image denoising","Gaussian noise","Wiener filters","Kernel"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Gaussian noise","image denoising","image filtering","image reconstruction","image segmentation","neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["digital image processing","filtering noise","high quality image","Wiener filtering","median filtering","linear CNN model","image denoising method"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["image denoising","average filtering","Wiener filtering","median filtering","linear CNN model"]}],"abstract":"In digital image processing, filtering noise to reconstruct a high quality image is an important work for further image processing such as object segmentation, detection, recognition and tracking, etc. In this paper, we will use a CNN model in deep learning for image denoising.

In fire flame detection, we need to extract visual features from video frames for training and test.

In this paper, we use YOLO model to implement flame detection and compare it with those shallow learning methods so as to determine the most efficient one for flame detection.

Synchronous behavior in DC micro-grids (MGs) can be achieved by means of the coupling of these subsystems under the condition of parameters mismatch. The method of detuning of one or more internal parameters in a statically coupled system can give rise to amplitude death (AD), a coupling induced stabilization of a dynamical system. This coupling technique has the advantage that this provides an open-loop stability solution for DC-DC converters in a DC MG in the presence of CPLs. The bifurcation analysis shows that the small detuning of parameters under strong coupling eliminates the standard oscillatory behavior from the large region of the parameter space, where the dominance of the AD can be observed. And this AD dominance produces a reliable dynamical control mechanism in the general case of coupled nonlinear oscillators. The goal of this work is to identify the dynamic states of coupled nonlinear oscillators and investigate how the heterogeneity of the system interacts with the coupling to produce coherent behavior.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8384767/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-20 Jan. 2018","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"18-20 Jan. 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8384767/","dateOfInsertion":"14 June 2018","publicationDate":"Jan. 2018","accessionNumber":"17843412","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Effect of heterogeneity on amplitude death based stability solution of DC microgrid","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Effect of heterogeneity on amplitude death based stability solution of DC microgrid","confLoc":"Thrissur, India","sourcePdf":"finalmanuscript206.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051166S","chronDate":"18-20 Jan. 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8373579","isNumber":"8384730","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8373579","xplore-issue":"8384730","articleId":"8384767","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":8384777,"authors":[{"name":"K Anoop","affiliation":["Department of EEE, Government Engineering College, Thrissur, Kerala"],"firstName":"K","lastName":"Anoop","id":"37085480357"},{"name":"M Nandakumar","affiliation":["Department of EEE, Government Engineering College, Thrissur, Kerala"],"firstName":"M","lastName":"Nandakumar","id":"37085443343"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2462-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-5386-2461-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-2463-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8384777","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":300},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A novel maximum power point tracking method based on particle swarm optimization combined with one cycle control","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 International Conference on Power, Instrumentation, Control and Computing (PICC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8373579/8384730/08384777.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","publicationTitle":"2018 International Conference on Power, Instrumentation, Control and Computing (PICC)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PICC.2018.8384777","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8384730","doi":"10.1109/PICC.2018.8384777","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Maximum power point trackers","Switches","Flip-flops","Solar panels","Particle swarm optimization","Temperature"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["maximum power point trackers","particle swarm optimisation","photovoltaic power systems","power generation control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["novel maximum power point tracking method","particle swarm optimization","maximum power point tracking algorithm","photo voltaic systems","partial shaded condition","uniform irradiance condition","global MPP","local MPP","different shading conditions","one cycle control","MPPT algorithm","PSO","perturb and observe algorithm","incremental conductance"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Maximum power point tracking(MPPT)","Photo Voltaic systems (PV)","One cycle control (OCC)","Particle swarm optimization (PSO)"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8384777","abstract":"This paper presents a maximum power point tracking (MPPT) algorithm based on particle swarm optimization (PSO) combined with one cycle control for photo voltaic systems under partial shaded condition. Algorithms like perturb and observe (P&O) and incremental conductance (IC) are very effective in maximum power point tracking under uniform irradiance condition. However under partial shaded condition, they fail to track the global MPP and get converged to local MPP. The proposed tracking algorithm overcome this technical challenge and can effectively determine the global MPP. Numerous simulation studies are carried out on different PV configurations under different shading conditions.

The other proposed algorithm is a modified list Viterbi algorithm, where trellis paths are fixed by re-encoded CRC bits and some CRC bits are used for the error correction.

Namely, a source and destination nodes equipped with multiple antennas which have a general correlation structures and arbitrary eigenvalue multiplicities, exchanging information through a dual-hop amplify-and-forward single antenna energy-constrained relay. To facilitate longer-distance wireless power transfer, the overall scavenged energy needs to be maximized. Hence, the energy-constrained relay harvest energy from the source radio-frequency signal through energy beamforming, the harvested energy is then used to forward the source information symbol to the destination. The time switching-based receiver along with the power splitting-based receiver protocols is examined in order to perform wireless information and power transfer at the relay. To this end, tight closed-form lower and upper bounds for the outage probability and ergodic capacity are derived, and used to examine the throughput of the delay-constrained and delay-tolerant transmission modes, respectively. Numerical results supported by simulations manifest the tightness of the presented analytical formulas. The effect of several parameters, like, energy harvesting ratio, source transmit power, number of antennas, and spatial fading correlation on the overall throughput is investigated. It is shown that increasing the number of antennas could be used to improve the system throughput or facilitate longer-distance wireless power transfer. On the other hand, the ramification of spatial correlation on the system throughput is also studied for arbitrary correlation structure. Moreover, it is revealed that the performance of power-splitting receiver outperforms the time-switching receiver at high signal-to-noise ratio. Finally, simulation results for the case of statistical channel state information is also included for comparison purposes.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/8274985/08385087.pdf","startPage":"36849","endPage":"36862","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2847254","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2847254","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8274985","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8385087","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Energy Beamforming for MIMO WIPT Relaying With Arbitrary Correlation","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Relays","Receivers","Correlation","Signal to noise ratio","MIMO communication","Transmitting antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["amplify and forward communication","antenna arrays","array signal processing","correlation methods","energy harvesting","MIMO communication","probability","protocols","radio receivers","radiofrequency power transmission","relay networks (telecommunication)","telecommunication network reliability","telecommunication power management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["arbitrary correlation","wireless information and power transfer","WIPT","MIMO","multiple-input multiple-output relaying systems","dual-hop amplify-and-forward single antenna energy-constrained relay","scavenged energy","wireless power transfer","time-switching receiver","power-splitting receiver","arbitrary correlation structure","spatial correlation","system throughput","source transmit power","energy harvesting ratio","delay-constrained","wireless information","power splitting-based receiver protocols","source information symbol","harvested energy","source radio-frequency signal","arbitrary eigenvalue multiplicities","general correlation structures","multiple antennas","spatial fading correlation","energy beamforming"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Amplify-and-forward relay","half-duplex relaying","wireless power transfer","spatial fading correlation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8385087/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2018","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 June 2018","displayDocTitle":"Energy Beamforming for MIMO WIPT Relaying With Arbitrary Correlation","volume":"6","htmlLink":"/document/8385087/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"2018","accessionNumber":"17948501","dateOfInsertion":"23 July 2018","isOpenAccess":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000266","fundingName":"Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council","grantNumber":"EP/N020391/1"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Energy Beamforming for MIMO WIPT Relaying With Arbitrary Correlation","sourcePdf":"access-almradi-2847254-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.108609S","chronDate":"2018","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"8274985","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"8274985","articleId":"8385087","onlineDate":"14 June 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8385093,"authors":[{"name":"Chia-Yu Chang","affiliation":["Communication Systems Department, EURECOM, Biot, France"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/8274985/8385093/chang-2847610-small.gif","p":["Chia-Yu Chang received the B.S. and M.S. degrees from National Taiwan University, Taiwan, in 2008 and 2010, respectively.

Unlike the core network slicing, radio access network (RAN) slicing is still at its infancy and several works just start to investigate the challenges and potentials to enable the multi-service RAN, toward a serviced-oriented RAN architecture. One of the major concerns in the RAN slicing is to provide different levels of isolation and sharing as per slice requirement. Moreover, both control and user plane processing may be customized allowing a slice owner to flexibly control its service. Enabling dynamic RAN composition with flexible functional split for disaggregated RAN deployments is another challenge. In this paper, we propose a RAN runtime slicing system through which the operation and behavior of the underlying RAN could be customized and controlled to meet slice requirements. We present a proof-of-concept prototype of the proposed RAN runtime slicing system for LTE, assess its feasibility and potentials, and demonstrate the isolation, sharing, and customization capabilities with three representative use cases.","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2847610","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2847610","startPage":"34018","endPage":"34042","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/8274985/08385093.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8274985","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"RAN Runtime Slicing System for Flexible and Dynamic Service Execution Environment","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 June 2018","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"2018","displayDocTitle":"RAN Runtime Slicing System for Flexible and Dynamic Service Execution Environment","publicationDate":"2018","dateOfInsertion":"10 July 2018","volume":"6","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8385093/","isOpenAccess":true,"accessionNumber":"17905777","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8385093/","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100010661","fundingName":"European Union\u2019s Horizon 2020 Framework Programme","grantNumber":"762057 (5G-PICTURE) and 761913 (SliceNet)"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"RAN Runtime Slicing System for Flexible and Dynamic Service Execution Environment","sourcePdf":"access-chang-2847610-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.110478S","chronDate":"2018","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"8274985","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"29","xplore-issue":"8274985","articleId":"8385093","onlineDate":"14 June 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":8385094,"authors":[{"name":"Xifan Tang","affiliation":["Laboratory for NanoIntegrated Systems, The University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5503868/8458338/8385094/tang-2847600-small.gif","p":["Xifan Tang (S\u201913\u2013M\u201917) received the B.Sc. degree in microelectronics from Fudan University, Shanghai, China, in 2011, and the M.Sc. degree in electrical engineering and the Ph.D. degree in computer science from the \u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland, in 2013 and 2017, respectively.

The opportunity lies in that RRAMs can realize the functionality of a static random access memory (SRAM) and a transmission gate in a unique device. However, most of predictive analyses shown in the state of the art are achieved by using analytical models. Unfortunately, while analytical models have been intensively refined for conventional FPGA architectures, their accuracy on RRAM-based FPGAs has not been carefully investigated. Consequently, misleading conclusions may be caused by using inaccurate analytical models. In this paper, we rely on electrical simulations and semi-custom design tools to perform detailed area and power comparison between SRAM-based and RRAM-based FPGAs. To enable accurate analysis, we develop a synthesizable Verilog generator for both SRAM-based and RRAM-based FPGAs and also enhance FPGA-SPICE to support most recent advanced RRAM-based circuits and FPGA architectures. The area analyses are based on full-chip layouts of SRAM-based and RRAM-based FPGAs, which are produced by a semi-custom design flow. We consider a full FPGA fabric, including core logic, configuring peripherals, and I/Os, which is more realistic than analytical models. The power analysis is based on SPICE simulation results by considering the 20 largest MCNC benchmarks. Simulation results identify that the target RHRS of RRAM-based FPGAs should be at least 20 MQ to guarantee energy improvements over SRAM-based FPGAs. Experimental results present that at nominal working voltage, RRAM-based FPGAs can improve up to 8% in area, on average 22% in delay and on average 16% in power, respectively, as compared to SRAM-based counterparts. Compared with SRAM-based FPGAs working at nominal voltage, near-Vt RRAM-based FPGAs can outperform close to two times in energy-delay product without delay overhead. As a result, RRAM-based FPGAs are more capable of trading-off energy and quality than the SRAM-based counterparts.","chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/5503868/8458338/8385094-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8385094/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 June 2018","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2018","volume":"8","issue":"3","accessionNumber":"18094013","dateOfInsertion":"10 September 2018","publicationDate":"Sept. 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8385094/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Post-P&R Performance and Power Analysis for RRAM-Based FPGAs","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001711","fundingName":"Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur F\u00f6rderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung","grantNumber":"200021-146600"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001742","fundingName":"United States-Israel Binational Science Foundation","grantNumber":"2016016"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100006602","fundingName":"Air Force Research Laboratory","grantNumber":"FA8650-18-2-7855"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000185","fundingName":"Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency","grantNumber":"FA8650-18-2-7855"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","chorusFlag":"true","title":"Post-P&R Performance and Power Analysis for RRAM-Based FPGAs","sourcePdf":"jetcas-tang-2847600-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.122869S","chronDate":"Sept.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"5503868","isNumber":"8458338","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5503868","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"8458338","articleId":"8385094","onlineDate":"14 June 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8385097,"authors":[{"name":"Jia-Jun Liang","affiliation":["College of Information Engineering, Shenzhen University, Shenzhen, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/8274985/8385097/liang-2847352-small.gif","p":["Jia-Jun Liang received the B.E. degree in electronic science and technique from the Guilin University of Electronic Technology, Guilin, China, in 2012, and the M.E. degree in radio physics from the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China, in 2015.

Generally, LSRSIR can be divided into two categories as follows: uni-source LSRSIR (US-LSRSIR) and cross-source LSRSIR (CS-LSRSIR). More specifically, US-LSRSIR means the inquiry remote sensing image and images in the searching data set come from the same remote sensing data source, whereas CS-LSRSIR is designed to retrieve remote sensing images with a similar content to the inquiry remote sensing image that are from a different remote sensing data source. In the literature, US-LSRSIR has been widely exploited, but CS-LSRSIR is rarely discussed. In practical situations, remote sensing images from different kinds of remote sensing data sources are continually increasing, so there is a great motivation to exploit CS-LSRSIR. Therefore, this paper focuses on CS-LSRSIR. To cope with CS-LSRSIR, this paper proposes source-invariant deep hashing convolutional neural networks (SIDHCNNs), which can be optimized in an end-to-end manner using a series of well-designed optimization constraints. To quantitatively evaluate the proposed SIDHCNNs, we construct a dual-source remote sensing image data set that contains eight typical land-cover categories and 10 000 dual samples in each category. Extensive experiments show that the proposed SIDHCNNs can yield substantial improvements over several baselines involving the most recent techniques.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Learning Source-Invariant Deep Hashing Convolutional Neural Networks for Cross-Source Remote Sensing Image Retrieval","doi":"10.1109/TGRS.2018.2839705","startPage":"6521","endPage":"6536","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2018.2839705","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8509678","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel7/36/8509678/08385104.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8385104","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 June 2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8385104/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2018","displayDocTitle":"Learning Source-Invariant Deep Hashing Convolutional Neural Networks for Cross-Source Remote Sensing Image Retrieval","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"56","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/8385104/","dateOfInsertion":"25 October 2018","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2018","accessionNumber":"18194371","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"National Key Research and Development Program of China","grantNumber":"2018YFB0505003"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"41601352, 41522110 and 61773295"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002858","fundingName":"China Postdoctoral Science Foundation","grantNumber":"2016M590716 and 2017T100581"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004543","fundingName":"China Scholarship Council","grantNumber":"201706275025"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Learning Source-Invariant Deep Hashing Convolutional Neural Networks for Cross-Source Remote Sensing Image Retrieval","sourcePdf":"tgrs-li-2839705-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.14632S","chronDate":"Nov.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"36","isNumber":"8509678","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"27","xplore-issue":"8509678","articleId":"8385104","onlineDate":"14 June 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-22"},{"_id":8385109,"authors":[{"name":"Ming-Chun Tang","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Millimeter Waves, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Ming-Chun","lastName":"Tang","orcid":"0000-0002-5528-1327","id":"37534668500"},{"name":"Xiaoming Chen","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Millimeter Waves, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Xiaoming","lastName":"Chen","id":"37086122508"},{"name":"Mei Li","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Millimeter Waves, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Mei","lastName":"Li","orcid":"0000-0001-8116-3423","id":"38260711600"},{"name":"Richard W.

It consists of a driven strip monopole and several parallel near-field resonant parasitic (NFRP) strips that reside on the surfaces of a hemispherical shell. The monopole strip lies on the interior surface; the NFRP strips lie on the exterior one. This arrangement facilitates the requisite stable near-field capacitive coupling between them over a wide frequency range. The particle swarm optimization algorithm is used to define the lengths and locations of these NFRP strips to achieve its optimized operational bandwidth around 700 MHz given its compact size. The hemispherical shell was 3-D printed with acrylonitrile butadiene styrene resin; the strips were applied to it with silver paste. This prototype was tested. The measured results, in agreement with their simulated values, demonstrate that it achieves a 17.97% -10 dB fractional impedance bandwidth over which stable realized gain values, near 3.5 dBi, are attained. With its low-cost fabrication and attractive performance characteristics, this 3-D printed antenna is suitable for indoor multipath wireless communication systems.","doi":"10.1109/LAWP.2018.2847286","pdfPath":"/iel7/7727/8514085/08385109.pdf","startPage":"2031","endPage":"2035","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Antennas and Wireless Propagation Letters","publicationTitle":"IEEE Antennas and Wireless Propagation Letters","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LAWP.2018.2847286","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8514085","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Particle Swarm Optimized, 3-D-Printed, Wideband, Compact Hemispherical Antenna","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8385109/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2018","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 June 2018","displayDocTitle":"Particle Swarm Optimized, 3-D-Printed, Wideband, Compact Hemispherical Antenna","volume":"17","issue":"11","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"29 October 2018","accessionNumber":"18204778","publicationDate":"Nov. 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8385109/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61471072 and 61701052"},{"fundingName":"Funding of the Innovative Leading Talents in Science and Technology of Chongqing","grantNumber":"CSTCCXLJRC201705"},{"fundingName":"Opening subject of State Key Laboratory of Millimeter Waves","grantNumber":"K201732"},{"fundingName":"Funding of the leading research talent cultivation plan of the Chongqing University","grantNumber":"cqu2017hbrc1A08"},{"fundingName":"funding of the Young Backbone Teachers in Colleges and Universities of Chongqing","grantNumber":"0307001104102"},{"fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities","grantNumber":"2018CDQYTX0025"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000923","fundingName":"Australian Research Council","grantNumber":"DP160102219"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Particle Swarm Optimized, 3-D-Printed, Wideband, Compact Hemispherical Antenna","sourcePdf":"lawp-pt2-tang-2847286-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.075157S","chronDate":"Nov.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"7727","isNumber":"8514085","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7727","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"8514085","articleId":"8385109","onlineDate":"14 June 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-03"},{"_id":8385110,"authors":[{"name":"Jawad Mirza","affiliation":["Wolfson School of Mechanical, Electrical and Manufacturing Engineering, Loughborough University, Loughborough, U.K."],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/8466982/8385110/mirza-2845748-small.gif","p":["Jawad Mirza (S\u201912\u2013M\u201916) received the B.Sc. degree\n in electrical (telecommunications) engineering from COMSATS Institute of Information Technology, Islamabad, Pakistan,\n in 2007; the M.Sc. degree in communications engineering from the University of Manchester, Manchester, U.K., in 2009;\n and the Ph.D. degree from the Victoria University of Wellington, Wellington, New Zealand, in 2016.

We consider multiple antennas at the base station (BS) and a single antenna at each cellular user (CU), D2D transmitter (DT), and D2D receiver (DR). We aim to minimize the total transmission power of the system by jointly designing the transmit beamforming at the BS and the transmit powers for both BS and DTs, while satisfying the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio based quality-of-service constraints for both CUs and DRs. Due to the nonconvex nature of the problem, we apply the semidefinite relaxation technique to find the optimal solution, which always satisfies the rank-one constraint. We also investigate three suboptimal fixed beamforming schemes: zero-forcing (ZF), regularized ZF, and hybrid maximum ratio transmission-ZF, where the focus is to minimize the total transmission power while reducing complexity. When perfect channel information is not available, we propose a robust transmit power minimization strategy with ZF beamforming that only requires limited feedback based channel direction information at the BS. Finally, computer simulation results are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed schemes.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2018.2845748","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8466982","startPage":"8324","endPage":"8335","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/25/8466982/08385110.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint Beamforming and Power Optimization for D2D Underlaying Cellular Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8385110/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2018","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 June 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8385110/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Joint Beamforming and Power Optimization for D2D Underlaying Cellular Networks","publicationDate":"Sept. 2018","accessionNumber":"18095098","isOpenAccess":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 May 2019","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"67","issue":"9","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"UK EPSRC","grantNumber":"EP/N007840/1"},{"fundingName":"Leverhulme Trust Research","grantNumber":"RPG-2017-129"},{"fundingName":"EPSRC","grantNumber":"EP/K015893/1"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Joint Beamforming and Power Optimization for D2D Underlaying Cellular Networks","sourcePdf":"tvt-mirza-2845748-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.090916S","chronDate":"Sept.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"8466982","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"8466982","articleId":"8385110","onlineDate":"14 June 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8385112,"authors":[{"name":"Zhe Li","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Engineering, Southeast University, Nanjing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/8390715/8385112/li-2846250-small.gif","p":["Zhe Li (S\u201916) received the B.S. degree from the Nanjing\n University of Posts and Telecommunication, Nanjing, China, in 2011, and the M.S. degree from Southeast University,\n Nanjing, China, in 2014, where he is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree with the School of Information and\n Engineering.

To this end, we introduce an optimal digital SI cancellation solution for shared-antenna-based direct-conversion transceivers. To establish that the underlying widely linear signal model is not adequate for strong transmit signals, the impact of various circuit imperfections, including power amplifier distortion, frequency-dependent I/Q imbalance, quantization noise, and thermal noise, on the performance of the conventional augmented least mean square (LMS) based SI canceller, is analyzed. In order to achieve a sufficient signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio when the nonlinear SI components are not negligible, we propose an augmented nonlinear LMS based SI canceller for a joint cancellation of both the linear and nonlinear SI components by virtue of a widely nonlinear model fit. A rigorous mean and mean square performance evaluation is conducted to justify the performance advantages of the proposed scheme over the conventional augmented LMS solution. Simulations on orthogonal frequency division multiplexing-based wireless local area network standard compliant waveforms support the analysis.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2018.2846250","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/78/8390715/08385112.pdf","startPage":"4065","endPage":"4078","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2018.2846250","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8390715","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Augmented Nonlinear LMS for Digital Self-Interference Cancellation in Full-Duplex Direct-Conversion Transceivers","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8385112","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 June 2018","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.1, 1 2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8385112/","displayDocTitle":"An Augmented Nonlinear LMS for Digital Self-Interference Cancellation in Full-Duplex Direct-Conversion Transceivers","volume":"66","issue":"15","publicationDate":"1 Aug.1, 2018","accessionNumber":"17857722","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8385112/","dateOfInsertion":"22 June 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61401094 and 61771124"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004608","fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province","grantNumber":"BK20140645"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100012226","fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities","grantNumber":"2242016K41050"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004543","fundingName":"China Scholarship Council"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Augmented Nonlinear LMS for Digital Self-Interference Cancellation in Full-Duplex Direct-Conversion Transceivers","sourcePdf":"tsp-xia-2846250-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.120454S","chronDate":"Aug.1, 1 2018","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"8390715","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"8390715","articleId":"8385112","onlineDate":"14 June 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8385117,"authors":[{"name":"Yu-Xiang Sun","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Millimeter Waves and the Department of Electronic Engineering, City University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong"],"firstName":"Yu-Xiang","lastName":"Sun","orcid":"0000-0001-8167-7141","id":"38580515200"},{"name":"Kwok Wa Leung","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Millimeter Waves and the Department of Electronic Engineering, City University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong"],"firstName":"Kwok Wa","lastName":"Leung","orcid":"0000-0002-3705-5190","id":"37279720400"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1536-1225"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1548-5757"}],"articleNumber":"8385117","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":21,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1765},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society","url":"http://www.ieeeaps.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Substrates","Antenna measurements","Antenna arrays","Reflection coefficient","Bandwidth","Loading","Gain"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna feeds","aperture-coupled antennas","dielectric resonator antennas","electromagnetic wave polarisation","microstrip antenna arrays","millimetre wave antenna arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["aperture-coupled source","sequential-rotation feeding network","circularly polarized substrate-integrated cylindrical dielectric resonator antenna array","CP substrate-integrated cylindrical DRA array","HEM11\u03b4 mode","frequency 57.0 GHz to 64.0 GHz"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Circular polarization","dielectric resonator antenna (DRA)","substrate-integrated antenna"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8385117","doi":"10.1109/LAWP.2018.2847295","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LAWP.2018.2847295","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8424524","publicationTitle":"IEEE Antennas and Wireless Propagation Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Antennas and Wireless Propagation Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/7727/8424524/08385117.pdf","startPage":"1401","endPage":"1405","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Circularly Polarized Substrate-Integrated Cylindrical Dielectric Resonator Antenna Array for 60 GHz Applications","abstract":"A 60 GHz circularly polarized (CP) substrate-integrated cylindrical dielectric resonator antenna (DRA) and its 2 \u00d7 2 array are studied.

Their application in fire detection systems will substantially improve detection accuracy, which will eventually minimize fire disasters and reduce the ecological and social ramifications. However, the major concern with CNN-based fire detection systems is their implementation in real-world surveillance networks, due to their high memory and computational requirements for inference. In this paper, we propose an original, energy-friendly, and computationally efficient CNN architecture, inspired by the SqueezeNet architecture for fire detection, localization, and semantic understanding of the scene of the fire. It uses smaller convolutional kernels and contains no dense, fully connected layers, which helps keep the computational requirements to a minimum. Despite its low computational needs, the experimental results demonstrate that our proposed solution achieves accuracies that are comparable to other, more complex models, mainly due to its increased depth. Moreover, this paper shows how a tradeoff can be reached between fire detection accuracy and efficiency, by considering the specific characteristics of the problem of interest and the variety of fire data.","doi":"10.1109/TSMC.2018.2830099","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8736908","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSMC.2018.2830099","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics: Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics: Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/6221021/8736908/08385121.pdf","startPage":"1419","endPage":"1434","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient Deep CNN-Based Fire Detection and Localization in Video Surveillance Applications","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 June 2018","displayDocTitle":"Efficient Deep CNN-Based Fire Detection and Localization in Video Surveillance Applications","volume":"49","issue":"7","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2019","dateOfInsertion":"14 June 2019","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8385121/","publicationDate":"July 2019","accessionNumber":"18743156","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8385121/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003725","fundingName":"National Research Foundation of Korea","grantNumber":"2016R1A2B4011712"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient Deep CNN-Based Fire Detection and Localization in Video Surveillance Applications","sourcePdf":"tsmc-yang-2830099-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.134889S","chronDate":"July  2019","xplore-pub-id":"6221021","isNumber":"8736908","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6221021","citationCount":"42","xplore-issue":"8736908","articleId":"8385121","onlineDate":"14 June 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8385123,"authors":[{"name":"Lampros N.

In this paper, the task is succeeded by designing a state-feedback controller that is not only structurally and computationally simple, but additionally it is decentralized and requires knowledge of the desired output trajectories only at each time instant.

For the convenience of digital implementation, this paper further investigates the approximate NOR problem of the SIP system in discrete-time framework. The key for solving the discrete-time NOR problem lies in how to solve a set of algebraic functional equations known as discrete regulator equations (DRE). Since the equations are very complicated, the accurate solution of the DRE can not be obtained. In this paper, we first show that the DRE associated with the SIP system are solvable by center manifold theorem and then use neural network approach to tackle with the tracking problem. Finally, we compare our method with polynomial approximation method.","doi":"10.1109/TSMC.2018.2834560","startPage":"2989","endPage":"2995","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and

Models","abstract":"Most microwave filters are currently designed using direct electromagnetic (EM) optimization. This method holds several disadvantages regarding the provided physical insight to designers and duration of the optimization process. To circumvent these drawbacks, we propose a filter design based on scalable circuit models. This model-driven design competes with EM optimization by maintaining the accuracy of the optimization results while providing a very significant speedup and gaining physical insight on the EM working mechanism of the filter of interest. This paper discusses the advantages of using the proposed model-driven design by the illustration on a defected ground structure filter. A scalable equivalent circuit model is used in the design procedure to provide physical insight to the designer and to speed up the design process enormously.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8385133/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2018","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 June 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8385133/","dateOfInsertion":"04 October 2018","publicationDate":"Oct. 2018","accessionNumber":"18145166","volume":"66","issue":"10","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Model-Driven Design of Microwave Filters Based on Scalable Circuit Models","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004418","fundingName":"Vrije Universiteit Brussel"},{"fundingName":"Research Foundation Flanders (FWO-Vlaanderen)"},{"fundingName":"Flemish Government (Methusalem Fund METH1)"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Model-Driven Design of Microwave Filters Based on Scalable Circuit Models","sourcePdf":"tmtt-vannechel-2842197-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.07008S","chronDate":"Oct.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"22","isNumber":"8481606","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"8481606","articleId":"8385133","onlineDate":"14 June 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":8385134,"authors":[{"name":"Nikolaos Tsapanos","affiliation":["Department of Informatics, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Thessaloniki, Greece"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5962385/8585323/8385134/tsapa-2839655-small.gif","p":["Nikolaos Tsapanos received the B.Sc. degree in computer science and the M.Sc. degree in computer science, specialized in technology and applications from the University of Ioannina, Ioannina, Greece, in 2003 and 2005, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree from the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Thessaloniki, Greece, in 2016.","His current research interests include machine learning, pattern recognition, and the inner workings of neural networks."]},"firstName":"Nikolaos","lastName":"Tsapanos","orcid":"0000-0002-9470-7159","id":"37993026800"},{"name":"Anastasios Tefas","affiliation":["Department of Informatics, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Thessaloniki, Greece"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5962385/8585323/8385134/tefas-2839655-small.gif","p":["Anastasios Tefas (S\u201997\u2013M\u201904) received the B.Sc. and Ph.D. degrees in informatics from the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Thessaloniki, Greece, in 1997 and 2002, respectively.","From 1997 to 2002, he was a Researcher and a Teaching Assistant with the Department of Informatics, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki.

The 2D-PDA (pixel size of 20-30 \u03bcm, pixel number of 32) were designed and characterized for the frequency response and crosstalk. In the on-wafer probing test, the averaged 3-dB bandwidth of 11.2 GHz and 19.8 GHz were measured for 30-\u03bcm and 20-\u03bcm pixels, respectively. In the MCF direct-coupling demonstration with the 2D-PDA, the selected 16 pixels could work well at 25 Gb/s (nonreturn-to-zero: NRZ). By using triangular-shape-aligned seven-core fiber and the square-shape-aligned seven cores in the 2D-PDA, the coupling efficiency and alignment tolerance were investigated for the universal MCF photoreceiver. In the demonstration of the mode-division multiplexing signal detection with 2D-PDA, the multiplexed three-mode signal with 20-Gbps quadrature phase-shift keying was directly coupled to the 2D-PDA.

In this paper, we investigate the problem of multi-user computation offloading for mobile cloud computing under dynamic environment, wherein mobile users become active or inactive dynamically, and the wireless channels for mobile users to offload computation vary randomly. As mobile users are self-interested and selfish in offloading computation tasks to the mobile cloud, we formulate the mobile users' offloading decision process under dynamic environment as a stochastic game. We prove that the formulated stochastic game is equivalent to a weighted potential game which has at least one Nash Equilibrium (NE). We quantify the efficiency of the NE, and further propose a multi-agent stochastic learning algorithm to reach the NE with a guaranteed convergence rate (which is also analytically derived). Finally, we conduct simulations to validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm and evaluate its performance under dynamic environment.","doi":"10.1109/TMC.2018.2847337","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMC.2018.2847337","startPage":"771","endPage":"786","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel7/7755/8660560/08385143.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8660560","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dynamic Computation Offloading for Mobile Cloud Computing: A Stochastic Game-Theoretic Approach","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8385143/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April 1 2019","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 June 2018","displayDocTitle":"Dynamic Computation Offloading for Mobile Cloud Computing: A Stochastic Game-Theoretic Approach","volume":"18","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"05 March 2019","accessionNumber":"18505864","publicationDate":"1 April 2019","htmlLink":"/document/8385143/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Jiangsu Provincial Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"BK20170755"},{"fundingName":"National Postdoctoral Program for Innovative Talents of China","grantNumber":"BX201700109"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61801505, 61572440 and 61771487"},{"fundingName":"Zhejiang Provincial Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"LR17F010002"},{"fundingName":"Natural Science and Engineering Research Council (NSERC)"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamic Computation Offloading for Mobile Cloud Computing: A Stochastic Game-Theoretic Approach","sourcePdf":"tmc-zheng-2847337-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.159983S","chronDate":"April 1 2019","xplore-pub-id":"7755","isNumber":"8660560","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7755","citationCount":"118","xplore-issue":"8660560","articleId":"8385143","onlineDate":"14 June 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8385144,"authors":[{"name":"Niloy Saha","affiliation":["Computer Science and Engineering Department, Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur, India"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6245516/9372348/8385144/saha-2847296-small.gif","p":["NILOY SAHA received the BTech degree in electronics and communication engineering from West Bengal University of Technology, India, in 2015.

The proposed scheme exploits the unique features of software-defined networking (SDN), such as flow-based nature, and network flexibility, in order to fulfill QoS requirements of each flow in the network. We consider two types of QoS routing strategies-delay-sensitive and loss-sensitive-for incoming packets from end-devices in the network. The former is devised to deal with delay-sensitive flows, and the latter deals with loss-sensitive flows, in order to maximize the overall network performance. We propose a greedy approach based on Yen's K-shortest paths algorithm to compute the optimal forwarding path, while considering the QoS requirements of each packet. Consequently, the SDN controller deploys adequate flow-rules at the forwarding devices in the network. Extensive simulation results show that the proposed scheme significantly reduces the end-to-end delay and the percentage of flows which violate QoS constraints compared to the benchmarks considered in the study. It is also observed that the proposed scheme adequately satisfies the QoS requirements for both type of flows in contrast to the existing schemes. In particular, with 2000 flows in the network, the proposed scheme achieves 13%, 14% and 15% (with AttMpls topology) and 38%, 37% and 39% (with Goodnet topology) reduction in QoS violated flows as compared to the existing LARAC, SPD, and MRC schemes, respectively.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9372348","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Emerging Topics in Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Emerging Topics in Computing","pdfPath":"/iel7/6245516/9372348/08385144.pdf","doi":"10.1109/TETC.2018.2847296","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TETC.2018.2847296","startPage":"390","endPage":"401","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sway: Traffic-Aware QoS Routing in Software-Defined IoT","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 June 2018","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.-March 1 2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8385144/","displayDocTitle":"Sway: Traffic-Aware QoS Routing in Software-Defined IoT","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8385144/","volume":"9","issue":"1","accessionNumber":"20726487","dateOfInsertion":"08 March 2021","publicationDate":"1 Jan.-March 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sway: Traffic-Aware QoS Routing in Software-Defined IoT","sourcePdf":"tetc-misra-2847296-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.135344S","chronDate":"Jan.-March 1 2021","xplore-pub-id":"6245516","isNumber":"9372348","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6245516","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"9372348","articleId":"8385144","onlineDate":"14 June 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-09"},{"_id":8385149,"authors":[{"name":"Santosh Pokhrel","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, The University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8/8452926/8385149/pokhr-2847601-small.gif","p":["Santosh Pokhrel (S\u201916) received the bachelor\u2019s degree in electronics and communication engineering from Jawaharlal Nehru Technological University at Kakinada, Kakinada, India, in 2015.

We observed several trends (e.g., widespread JSON support, software-generated documentation), but, at the same time, high diversity in services, including differences in adherence to best practices, with only 0.8 percent of services strictly complying with all REST principles. Our results can help practitioners evolve guidelines and standards for designing higher quality services and also understand deficiencies in currently deployed services.

In this paper, the scalable video coding over cooperative vehicular networks is investigated to improve the performance of video streaming services. We formulate a joint optimization problem to answer questions about the number of video layers that should be transmitted for each vehicle, the selection of relay vehicles to assist destination vehicles, and the assignment of radio resources to direct and cooperative communications. We decouple the problem into two subproblems, i.e., the quality of service (QoS)-driven resource allocation (QoSRA) subproblem and the layer selection (LS) subproblem. We solve the QoSRA subproblem by converting it into a generalized maximum concurrent flow problem, and propose a tabu search-based metaheuristic algorithm for the LS subproblem. The simulation results verify the efficiency of the proposed scheme and provide some insight into the tradeoff between system performance and computation complexity.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2018.2847325","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/25/8466982/08385158.pdf","startPage":"7924","endPage":"7936","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2018.2847325","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8466982","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Resource Allocation for SVC Streaming Over Cooperative Vehicular Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8385158","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 June 2018","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8385158/","displayDocTitle":"Resource Allocation for SVC Streaming Over Cooperative Vehicular Networks","volume":"67","issue":"9","publicationDate":"Sept. 2018","accessionNumber":"18095085","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8385158/","dateOfInsertion":"17 September 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"National Key Research and Development Program of China","grantNumber":"2018YFB0803400"},{"fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61772488 and 61371118"},{"fundingName":"JSPS KAKENHI","grantNumber":"JP16H02817, 16H02817, 17K12670, 18K18036 and 15K21599"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Resource Allocation for SVC Streaming Over Cooperative Vehicular Networks","sourcePdf":"tvt-zhou-2847325-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.122205S","chronDate":"Sept.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"8466982","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"8466982","articleId":"8385158","onlineDate":"14 June 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8385167,"authors":[{"name":"Mohammad Shareef Ghanim","affiliation":["Department of Civil Engineering, Birzeit University, Birzeit, Palestine"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6979/8703754/8385167/ghani-2842147-small.gif","p":["Mohammad Shareef Ghanim received the Ph.D. degree in civil engineering from Michigan State University.

These types of counts are often used to analyze operational performance of signalized intersections under different traffic conditions and peak hours. There are several methods to collect these movements, such as manual counts and video image processing. Traffic studies require turning movement counts although they may not be readily available, especially in the case of traffic forecasting or when seasonal adjustment factors are applied. In these cases, only approach volumes might be available and turning movements are assumed using different techniques to balance the inbound and outbound traffic. Nonetheless, these techniques require initial conditions, and their outcomes are highly sensitive to the initial assumptions. In this paper, a robust and practical method is developed. The turning movement counts at 691 four-leg, and 156 three-leg signalized intersections are analyzed to develop an accurate and reliable turning movement estimation model. A total of 4,175 hours of turning movement counts are used. An artificial neural networks (ANN) model is trained to analyze the relationship between the approach volumes and the corresponding turning movements. The results show that the developed ANN model can be utilized to predict turning movements at a high level of accuracy.","doi":"10.1109/TITS.2018.2842147","startPage":"1828","endPage":"1836","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TITS.2018.2842147","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8703754","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/6979/8703754/08385167.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Estimating Turning Movements at Signalized Intersections Using Artificial Neural Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8385167/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Estimating Turning Movements at Signalized Intersections Using Artificial Neural Networks","volume":"20","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/8385167/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"18636182","publicationDate":"May 2019","dateOfInsertion":"01 May 2019","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2019","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 June 2018","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Estimating Turning Movements at Signalized Intersections Using Artificial Neural Networks","sourcePdf":"tits-ghanim-2842147-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.090287S","chronDate":"May  2019","xplore-pub-id":"6979","isNumber":"8703754","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6979","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"8703754","articleId":"8385167","onlineDate":"14 June 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8385170,"authors":[{"name":"Jing Guo","affiliation":["Research School of Engineering, Australian National University, Canberra, ACT, Australia"],"firstName":"Jing","lastName":"Guo","orcid":"0000-0001-6752-6064","id":"37085368464"},{"name":"Xiangyun Zhou","affiliation":["Research School of Engineering, Australian National University, Canberra, ACT, Australia"],"firstName":"Xiangyun","lastName":"Zhou","orcid":"0000-0001-8973-9079","id":"37085394573"},{"name":"Salman Durrani","affiliation":["Research School of Engineering, Australian National University, Canberra, ACT, Australia"],"firstName":"Salman","lastName":"Durrani","orcid":"0000-0002-7124-282X","id":"37269825400"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2162-2337"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2162-2345"}],"articleNumber":"8385170","dbTime":"27 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":10,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":944},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8385170","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Lead","Training","Fading channels","Geometry","Array signal processing","Antenna arrays","Wireless communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","radiofrequency power transmission","stochastic processes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wireless power transfer","mmWave power beacons","directional beamforming","directional power transfer scheme","power coverage probability","beamforming"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Wireless power transfer","mmWave","power beacon","directional beamforming","stochastic geometry"]}],"doi":"10.1109/LWC.2018.2846575","publicationTitle":"IEEE Wireless Communications Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Wireless Communications Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/5962382/8643663/08385170.pdf","startPage":"17","endPage":"20","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LWC.2018.2846575","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8643663","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Wireless Power Transfer via mmWave Power Beacons With Directional Beamforming","abstract":"In this letter, we consider a large scale network where multiple devices are wirelessly charged by power beacons (PBs) using millimeter wave.

In neuro-spike communication, the information, encoded into spike trains, is communicated to various brain regions through neuronal network. An output neuron needs to receive signal from multiple input neurons to generate a spike. Hence, in this paper, we aim to quantify the information transmitted through the multiple-input single-output (MISO) neuro-spike communication channel by considering models for axonal propagation, synaptic transmission, and spike generation. Moreover, the spike generation and propagation in each neuron requires opening and closing of numerous ionic channels on the cell membrane, which consumes considerable amount of ATP molecules called metabolic energy. Thus, we evaluate how applying a constraint on available metabolic energy affects the maximum achievable mutual information of this system. To this aim, we derive a closed form equation for the sum rate of the MISO neuro-spike communication channel and analyze it under the metabolic cost constraints. Finally, we discuss the impacts of changes in number of pre-synaptic neurons on the achievable rate and quantify the tradeoff between maximum achievable sum rate and the consumed metabolic energy.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8385175/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2018","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 June 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"17","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"July 2018","dateOfInsertion":"01 August 2018","accessionNumber":"17973442","htmlLink":"/document/8385175/","pubMedId":"29994259","displayDocTitle":"Sum Rate of MISO Neuro-Spike Communication Channel With Constant Spiking Threshold","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100010663","fundingName":"H2020 European Research Council","grantNumber":"ERC-2013-CoG 616922"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004410","fundingName":"T\u00fcrkiye Bilimsel ve Teknolojik Ara\u015ftirma Kurumu","grantNumber":"BIDEB-2215"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sum Rate of MISO Neuro-Spike Communication Channel With Constant Spiking Threshold","sourcePdf":"tnb-ramezani-2847607-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.134252S","chronDate":"July  2018","xplore-pub-id":"7728","isNumber":"8424246","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7728","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"8424246","articleId":"8385175","onlineDate":"14 June 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8385178,"authors":[{"name":"Tobias Buckel","affiliation":["Christian Doppler Laboratory for Digitally Assisted RF Transceivers for Future Mobile Communications, Institute for Communications Engineering and RF-Systems, Johannes Kepler University, Linz, Austria"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8919/8511082/8385178/bucke-2840844-small.gif","p":["Tobias Buckel (S\u201917) received the Dipl.Ing.

The proposed architecture utilizes an RF-DAC with phase modulated RF clock and adjusted I/Q components. By incorporating phase modulation the quadrature component is kept small while the inphase component approaches the complex signal envelope. Compared to a digital-quadrature TX architecture this results in a significantly reduced average and peak RF-DAC cell utilization. Therefore, the RF-DAC can be operated in less back-off at higher average output power and drain efficiency. The phase modulation is constrained in order to relax the phase modulators system requirements. Compared to a digital polar TX architecture utilizing an RF digital phase-locked loop with two-point phase modulation, this results in reduced frequency modulation and digital-controlled oscillator tuning range requirements.

The ADC is mainly constituted by main and replica pseudo PLLs. Compared with conventional techniques, this technique minimizes the main loop's input ripple by means of inverting the replica loop's input ripple and transferring it to the input of the main loop for the sum of the two ripples, so the accuracy of the ADC should be improved. To achieve the transfer function above, on the transferring path, a wide-band current mode amplifier is proposed. The proposed ADC is well suited for accuracy and power improved design. Fabricated with a 0.18-\u03bcm CMOS process, the ADC achieves 65-dB SNDR while operating from a 1.2-V supply and using a 1-kHz input sine wave.

The VF strategy is a robust and valid guidance method and its stability is proved using ISS properties. Many existing path following algorithms for fixed-wing UAVs are only proposed for straight-lines and orbits. However, the path required to be followed is always in approximate curves rather than straight-lines and orbits in many high-level missions, such as obstacle avoidance, search, and surveillance. The nonlinear-theoretic notion of ISS is playing a central role in the control law design and stability analysis. The error kinematics are converted into two interconnected subsystems with proven ISS properties, which yield the overall system that is globally asymptotically stable, i.e., and the along-track error and the cross-track error asymptotically approach zeros from any initial position in the space. The followed path is defined in terms of the arc-length parameter, and it can be expanded according to the waypoint fitting without the need to obtain a global function representation. The singularity of multiple closest points on the path is eliminated by constructing a speed profile of a virtual point on the path. The scheme is validated with a semi-physical experiment combined by an actual autopilot, ground station and the X-Plane flight simulator. Flight tests using a small fixed-wing UAV show excellent tracking performance of the curved path following.","doi":"10.1109/TSMC.2018.2839840","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics: Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics: Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/6221021/9142459/08385190.pdf","startPage":"2897","endPage":"2904","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSMC.2018.2839840","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9142459","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Integrating Vector Field Approach and Input-to-State Stability Curved Path Following for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8385190","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 June 2018","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2020","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8385190/","displayDocTitle":"Integrating Vector Field Approach and Input-to-State Stability Curved Path Following for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles","volume":"50","issue":"8","publicationDate":"Aug. 2020","accessionNumber":"19785876","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8385190/","dateOfInsertion":"17 July 2020","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Integrating Vector Field Approach and Input-to-State Stability Curved Path Following for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles","sourcePdf":"tsmc-zhao-2839840-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.085539S","chronDate":"Aug.  2020","xplore-pub-id":"6221021","isNumber":"9142459","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6221021","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"9142459","articleId":"8385190","onlineDate":"14 June 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2020","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":8385191,"authors":[{"name":"Yangcan Zhou","affiliation":["School of Electronic Science and Engineering, Nanjing University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Yangcan","lastName":"Zhou","orcid":"0000-0003-0005-7552","id":"37086025494"},{"name":"Zhiyu Chen","affiliation":["School of Electronic Science and Engineering, Nanjing University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Zhiyu","lastName":"Chen","orcid":"0000-0002-1321-1793","id":"37086380560"},{"name":"Jun Lin","affiliation":["School of Electronic Science and Engineering, Nanjing University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Jun","lastName":"Lin","id":"38247795900"},{"name":"Zhongfeng Wang","affiliation":["School of Electronic Science and Engineering, Nanjing University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Zhongfeng","lastName":"Wang","orcid":"0000-0002-7227-4786","id":"37085783924"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1549-7747"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-3791"}],"articleNumber":"8385191","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":782},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Circuits and Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieee-cas.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Approximate computing","Signal processing algorithms","Maximum likelihood decoding","Forward error correction","Approximation algorithms","Random access memory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decoding","error correction codes","field programmable gate arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["high-speed successive-cancellation decoder","polar codes","forward-error-correction codes","asymptotically capacity-achieving","symmetric memoryless channels","serial processing nature","efficient decoder","decoder core","efficient approximate computing units","Apx-CUs","field-programmable gate-array implementation results","fast simplified SC algorithm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Error-correction codes","polar codes","successive-cancellation decoding","approximate computing","very-large-scale integration (VLSI)"]}],"abstract":"Polar codes are a new class of forward-error-correction codes, which have been proved asymptotically capacity-achieving for symmetric memoryless channels.

Experimental results reveal that cycling has a very weak impact on RTN in 3-D arrays, confirming even from this standpoint the general improvement in performance and reliability of these arrays with respect to their planar predecessors. In particular, even a large cycling dose of 10k program/erase cycles gives rise just to a slight increase of RTN, which is attributed to the growth of the average number of trap states contributing to the phenomenon. The statistical distribution of the amplitude of the single-trap RTN fluctuations is shown, instead, to be unaffected by cycling and to keep the same temperature sensitivity irrespective of the cycling dose.","doi":"10.1109/LED.2018.2847341","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8419092","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LED.2018.2847341","publicationTitle":"IEEE Electron Device Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Electron Device Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/55/8419092/08385198.pdf","startPage":"1175","endPage":"1178","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Impact of Cycling on Random Telegraph Noise in 3-D NAND Flash Arrays","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 June 2018","displayDocTitle":"Impact of Cycling on Random Telegraph Noise in 3-D NAND Flash Arrays","volume":"39","issue":"8","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2018","dateOfInsertion":"24 July 2018","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8385198/","publicationDate":"Aug. 2018","accessionNumber":"17955132","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8385198/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Impact of Cycling on Random Telegraph Noise in 3-D NAND Flash Arrays","sourcePdf":"led-nicosia-2847341-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.086018S","chronDate":"Aug.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"55","isNumber":"8419092","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"55","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"8419092","articleId":"8385198","onlineDate":"14 June 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Letter","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8385199,"authors":[{"name":"Rong Jiang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Rong Jiang, photograph and biography not available at the time of publication."]},"firstName":"Rong","lastName":"Jiang","orcid":"0000-0003-3746-192X","id":"37085731585"},{"name":"Xiao Shen","affiliation":["Department of Physics and Material Science, University of Memphis, Memphis, TN, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Xiao Shen, photograph and biography not available at the time of publication."]},"firstName":"Xiao","lastName":"Shen","id":"37597240900"},{"name":"Jingtian Fang","affiliation":["Department of Physics and Astronomy, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Jingtian Fang, photograph and biography not available at the time of publication."]},"firstName":"Jingtian","lastName":"Fang","orcid":"0000-0002-9493-2276","id":"37085648173"},{"name":"Pan Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Pan Wang, photograph and biography not available at the time of publication."]},"firstName":"Pan","lastName":"Wang","orcid":"0000-0001-9970-5032","id":"37086178783"},{"name":"En Xia Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN, USA"],"bio":{"p":["En Xia Zhang, photograph and biography not available at the time of publication."]},"firstName":"En Xia","lastName":"Zhang","orcid":"0000-0002-8021-2411","id":"37591455500"},{"name":"Jin Chen","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Jin Chen, photograph and biography not available at the time of publication."]},"firstName":"Jin","lastName":"Chen","id":"37085384388"},{"name":"Daniel M.

Specifically, a novel aperiodic adaptive event-triggered communication mechanism is introduced to reduce the transmission load, which covers the previous ones as special cases. By partially resorting to the time-dependent Lyapunov function, a new synchronization criterion is derived, which depends on both the upper and lower bounds of variable sampling interval. Finally, Chua's circuit system is chosen as an illustrative example to show the virtue and effectiveness of the achieved synchronization strategies.","doi":"10.1109/TCSII.2018.2847282","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs","pdfPath":"/iel7/8920/8653436/08385200.pdf","startPage":"442","endPage":"446","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8653436","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSII.2018.2847282","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Notice of Violation of IEEE Publication Principles: An Adaptive Event-Triggered Synchronization Approach for Chaotic Lur\u2019e Systems Subject to Aperiodic Sampled Data","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8385200","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2019","displayDocTitle":"Notice of Violation of IEEE Publication Principles: An Adaptive Event-Triggered Synchronization Approach for Chaotic Lur\u2019e Systems Subject to Aperiodic Sampled Data","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8385200/","publicationDate":"March 2019","dateOfInsertion":"26 February 2019","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"18489629","htmlLink":"/document/8385200/","volume":"66","issue":"3","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 June 2018","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61703275 and 61673178"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Notice of Violation of IEEE Publication Principles: An Adaptive Event-Triggered Synchronization Approach for Chaotic Lur\u2019e Systems Subject to Aperiodic Sampled Data","sourcePdf":"tcsii-wang-2847282-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.07484S","chronDate":"March  2019","xplore-pub-id":"8920","isNumber":"8653436","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8920","citationCount":"45","xplore-issue":"8653436","articleId":"8385200","onlineDate":"14 June 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8385206,"authors":[{"name":"Xu Ma","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Digital TV System of Guangdong Province and Shenzhen City, Research Institute, Tsinghua University, Shenzhen, China"],"firstName":"Xu","lastName":"Ma","id":"37085444850"},{"name":"Fang Yang","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Digital TV System of Guangdong Province and Shenzhen City, Research Institute, Tsinghua University, Shenzhen, China"],"firstName":"Fang","lastName":"Yang","orcid":"0000-0003-3575-5086","id":"37292384500"},{"name":"Jian Song","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Digital TV System of Guangdong Province and Shenzhen City, Research Institute, Tsinghua University, Shenzhen, China"],"firstName":"Jian","lastName":"Song","id":"37085372787"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-7798"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2558"},{"format":"CD","value":"2373-7891"}],"articleNumber":"8385206","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":377},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"abstract":"This letter investigates the sparse channel estimation approach for multiple input multiple output systems in high mobility scenarios.

The high-frequency bands are fused by a parameter-adaptive pulse-coupled neural network (PA-PCNN) model, in which all the PCNN parameters can be adaptively estimated by the input band. The low-frequency bands are merged by a novel strategy that simultaneously addresses two crucial issues in medical image fusion, namely, energy preservation and detail extraction. Finally, the fused image is reconstructed by performing inverse NSST on the fused high-frequency and low-frequency bands. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified by four different categories of medical image fusion problems [computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance (MR), MR-T1 and MR-T2, MR and positron emission tomography, and MR and single-photon emission CT] with more than 80 pairs of source images in total. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can obtain more competitive performance in comparison to nine representative medical image fusion methods, leading to state-of-the-art results on both visual quality and objective assessment.","doi":"10.1109/TIM.2018.2838778","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8568022","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIM.2018.2838778","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement","pdfPath":"/iel7/19/8568022/08385209.pdf","startPage":"49","endPage":"64","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Medical Image Fusion With Parameter-Adaptive Pulse Coupled Neural Network in Nonsubsampled Shearlet Transform Domain","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 June 2018","displayDocTitle":"Medical Image Fusion With Parameter-Adaptive Pulse Coupled Neural Network in Nonsubsampled Shearlet Transform Domain","volume":"68","issue":"1","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2019","dateOfInsertion":"07 December 2018","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8385209/","publicationDate":"Jan. 2019","accessionNumber":"18292437","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8385209/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61701160, 11601115, 81571760 and 61501164"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003995","fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of Anhui Province","grantNumber":"1808085QF186"},{"fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities","grantNumber":"JZ2018HGTB0228 and JZ2016HGBZ1025"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Medical Image Fusion With Parameter-Adaptive Pulse Coupled Neural Network in Nonsubsampled Shearlet Transform Domain","sourcePdf":"tim-liu-2838778-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.159119S","chronDate":"Jan.  2019","xplore-pub-id":"19","isNumber":"8568022","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"19","citationCount":"50","xplore-issue":"8568022","articleId":"8385209","onlineDate":"14 June 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8385211,"authors":[{"name":"Yamei Zhang","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Radar Imaging and Microwave Photonics, Ministry of Education, Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Nanjing, China"],"bio":{"p":["Yamei Zhang (S\u201913) received the B.S. degree from the Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Nanjing, China, in 2012, where she is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree with the Key Laboratory of Radar Imaging and Microwave Photonics, Ministry of Education.","Her current research focuses on microwave photonic signal generation and processing."]},"firstName":"Yamei","lastName":"Zhang","id":"38494384200"},{"name":"Shilong Pan","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Radar Imaging and Microwave Photonics, Ministry of Education, Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Nanjing, China"],"bio":{"p":["Shilong Pan (S\u201906\u2013M\u201909\u2013SM\u201913) received the B.S. and Ph.D. degrees in electronics engineering from Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, in 2004 and 2008, respectively.","From 2008 to 2010, he was a Vision 2010 Post-Doctoral Research Fellow with the Microwave Photonics Research Laboratory, University of Ottawa, Canada.

Indeed, these models are often used for performing accurate State-of-Charge (SoC) estimations in energy storage systems used in microgrids or powering pure electric and hybrid cars. To this aim, a novel neural networks ensemble approach for modeling electrochemical cells is proposed in this paper. Herein, the system identification has been faced by means of a gray box technique, in which different and specialized neural networks are used for identifying the unknown internal behaviors of the cell. In particular, the a priori knowledge on the system dynamic is used for defining the network architecture. Specifically, each nonlinear function appearing in the system equations is approximated by a distinct neural network. The proposed model has been validated upon three different data sets both in terms of model accuracy and effectiveness in the SoC estimation task. The achieved performances have been compared with those of other computational intelligence approaches proposed in the literature. The results prove the effectiveness of the gray box scheme, achieving very promising performances in both the system identification accuracy and the SoC estimation task.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2019","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8385218/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 June 2018","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"18394284","pubMedId":"29994269","volume":"30","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/8385218/","publicationDate":"Feb. 2019","dateOfInsertion":"22 January 2019","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A Novel Neural Networks Ensemble Approach for Modeling Electrochemical Cells","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Novel Neural Networks Ensemble Approach for Modeling Electrochemical Cells","sourcePdf":"tnnls-luzi-2827307-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.102864S","chronDate":"Feb.  2019","xplore-pub-id":"5962385","isNumber":"8621620","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5962385","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"8621620","articleId":"8385218","onlineDate":"14 June 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8385259,"authors":[{"name":"Marco Carminati","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Elettronica, Informazione e Bioingegneria Politecnico di Milano, Milano, Italy"],"firstName":"Marco","lastName":"Carminati","id":"37407709800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-4182-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-4183-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8385259","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":142},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Intelligent sensors","Wireless sensor networks","Environmental monitoring","Air quality","Biosensors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["chemical sensors","condition monitoring","environmental monitoring (geophysics)","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["miniaturized sensors","environmental sensors","pervasive wireless networks","innovative impedance-based sensors","drinking water monitoring","air quality"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["air quality","water monitoring","wireless sensors networks","impedance","microfabrication"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Trends and paradigms in the development of miniaturized sensors for environmental monitoring","doi":"10.1109/EE1.2018.8385259","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8385243","endPage":"5","publicationTitle":"2018 IEEE International Conference on Environmental Engineering (EE)","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 IEEE International Conference on Environmental Engineering (EE)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8376940/8385243/08385259.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EE1.2018.8385259","startPage":"1","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8385259","abstract":"Sensors, being the interface between the physical world and the information processing domain, are fostering the affirmation and consolidation of Internet-of-Everything scenarios.

This technology could include telephones, television, computers and the Internet. The arrival of high-speed Internet connectivity to the Kingdom of Tonga continues to bring opportunities such as business growth and jobs creation; however, there is also a growing digital divide affecting the country and other regions of the world. These motivate us to debate and seek the best way to reduce the divide in Tonga. Much of the research on this area focuses on the accessibility to the technologies, while some works have addressed the inequality in the ability and skills to use the technology. Motivated by the United Nations' sustainable development goals (SDGs), especially Goal 9 on Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure and Goal 10 on Reduced Inequalities, we examine both perspectives of digital divide in Tonga. Moreover, we introduce the most recent broadband technologies and discuss their potential to enable Tonga's digital transformation from the perspectives of reliability, security and affordability. We then envision a sustainable multi-tenancy broadband infrastructure to integrate various access technologies in order to offer multi-services, which can best accommodate Tongan's various ICT needs according to their different geographical and socio-economic characteristics.

Renewable energy systems are integrated into the power grid by essentially a power electronics converter system, these power electronic converters act as an inertialess interface. Now, large power injection to the grid from an inertialess system leads to an effective reduction in the overall system inertia thus affecting overall system damping. In this paper, the impact of integrating renewable energy on damping of the system is first examined by eigenvalue analysis, then a supplementary adaptive wide-area damping controller is implemented to improve the system damping of low-frequency oscillation. Two different approaches for implementation of damping controller has been carried out. In the first approach, the damping controller is implemented by giving control action to the excitation system of synchronous generator and in seconds approach the control action is provided through the power electronics converter using power modulation technique. It is observed from the simulation results that the power system damping is better improved by control action through converters than the excitation control.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8385279","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ETECHNXT.2018.8385283","publicationTitle":"2018 IEEMA Engineer Infinite Conference (eTechNxT)","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 IEEMA Engineer Infinite Conference (eTechNxT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8375126/8385279/08385283.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doi":"10.1109/ETECHNXT.2018.8385283","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive wide area damping control for renewable integrated system","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-14 March 2018","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive wide area damping control for renewable integrated system","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"13-14 March 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8385283/","publicationDate":"March 2018","accessionNumber":"17843636","dateOfInsertion":"14 June 2018","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8385283/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive wide area damping control for renewable integrated system","confLoc":"New Delhi, India","sourcePdf":"1570414865.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059623S","chronDate":"13-14 March 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8375126","isNumber":"8385279","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8375126","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8385279","articleId":"8385283","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":8385303,"authors":[{"name":"Rajaneesh Acharya","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronics, National Institute of Technology Surathkal, Karnataka, India"],"firstName":"Rajaneesh","lastName":"Acharya","id":"37086398762"},{"name":"Debashisha Jena","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronics, National Institute of Technology Surathkal, Karnataka, India"],"firstName":"Debashisha","lastName":"Jena","id":"37585323600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1138-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1139-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8385303","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":190},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8385303","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Kinematics","Space exploration","Heuristic algorithms","Aerospace electronics","Trajectory","Planning"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mobile robots","path planning","sampling methods","steering systems","trees (mathematics)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["sampling based motion planning","Ackermann steering system","uniform sampling","path exploration","path formulation","Gaussian sampling based strategy","kinematics model","rapidly-exploring random tree","RRT","configuration space"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["RRT","RRT\u2217","PRM","RRT-Connect","Lazy RRT"]}],"abstract":"The objective of this work is to apply sampling based algorithm to generate a path to Ackermann steering system with given constraints based on its Kinematics model.

One reason for observing a gap between modeled and actual channel behavior is the absence of spatial consistency in many such models, that is, spatial correlations over an area in the x; y-dimensions are not accounted for, making it difficult to study, e.g., area-throughput measures. In this paper, we propose an algorithm that can distinguish between regions of non-line-of-sight (NLoS) and lineof- sight (LoS) via a rank-metric criterion combined with a spiral search. With a k-means clustering algorithm a throughput per region (i.e., cluster) can be calculated, leading to what we refer to as \"area-throughput\". For evaluating the proposed orthogonality clustering scheme we use a simple filtered MIMO channel model which is spatially consistent, with known degrees of freedom. Moreover, we employ actual (spatially consistent) area channel measurements based on spatial sampling using a spider antenna and show that the proposed algorithm can be used to estimate the degrees of freedom, and, subsequently, the number of users that maximizes the throughput per square meter.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Area Rate Evaluation based on Spatial Clustering of massive MIMO Channel Measurements","publicationTitle":"WSA 2018; 22nd International ITG Workshop on Smart Antennas","displayPublicationTitle":"WSA 2018; 22nd International ITG Workshop on Smart Antennas","pdfPath":"/iel7/8385439/8385440/08385445.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8385440","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8385445","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"VDE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8385445/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-16 March 2018","displayDocTitle":"Area Rate Evaluation based on Spatial Clustering of massive MIMO Channel Measurements","conferenceDate":"14-16 March 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"14 June 2018","publicationDate":"March 2018","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Area Rate Evaluation based on Spatial Clustering of massive MIMO Channel Measurements","confLoc":"Bochum, Germany","sourcePdf":"454541005.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.028096S","chronDate":"14-16 March 2018","isNumber":"8385440","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8385439","articleId":"8385445","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"VDE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":8385449,"authors":[{"name":"Paolo Baracca","firstName":"Paolo","lastName":"Baracca"},{"name":"Andreas Weber","firstName":"Andreas","lastName":"Weber"},{"name":"Thorsten Wild","firstName":"Thorsten","lastName":"Wild"},{"name":"Christophe Grangeat","firstName":"Christophe","lastName":"Grangeat"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-3-8007-4541-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8385449","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":115},"abstract":"Massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) is a fundamental enabler to provide high data throughput in next generation cellular networks. By equipping the base stations (BSs) with tens or hundreds of antenna elements, narrow and high gain beams can be used to spatially multiplex several user equipment (UE) devices. While increasing the achievable performance, focusing the transmit power into specific UE directions also poses new issues when performing the radio frequency (RF) exposure assessment. In fact, the spatial distribution of the actual BS transmit power strongly depends on the deployment scenario and on the position of the UEs. Traditional methods for assessing the RF exposure compliance boundaries around BS sites are generally based on maximum transmit power and static beams. In massive MIMO systems, these approaches tend to be very conservative, in particular when time averaging is properly considered. In this work, we propose to leverage the three dimensional spatial channel model standardized by the Third Generation Partnership Project in order to assess reasonably foreseeable compliance boundaries of massive MIMO BSs. The analysis is performed by considering BSs fully loaded and different configurations of active UEs per cell. Numerical results show that the statistical approach developed in this paper allows reducing to nearly half the compliance distance when compared to the traditional method.","publicationTitle":"WSA 2018; 22nd International ITG Workshop on Smart Antennas","displayPublicationTitle":"WSA 2018; 22nd International ITG Workshop on Smart Antennas","pdfPath":"/iel7/8385439/8385440/08385449.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8385440","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Statistical Approach for RF Exposure Compliance Boundary Assessment in Massive MIMO Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8385449","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"VDE","displayDocTitle":"A Statistical Approach for RF Exposure Compliance Boundary Assessment in Massive MIMO Systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-16 March 2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8385449/","conferenceDate":"14-16 March 2018","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"March 2018","dateOfInsertion":"14 June 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Statistical Approach for RF Exposure Compliance Boundary Assessment in Massive MIMO Systems","confLoc":"Bochum, Germany","sourcePdf":"454541009.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.022127S","chronDate":"14-16 March 2018","isNumber":"8385440","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8385439","citationCount":"4","articleId":"8385449","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"VDE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-09"},{"_id":8385450,"authors":[{"name":"Gerhard Wunder","firstName":"Gerhard","lastName":"Wunder"},{"name":"Ingo Roth","firstName":"Ingo","lastName":"Roth"},{"name":"Mahdi Barzegar","firstName":"Mahdi","lastName":"Barzegar"},{"name":"Axel Flinth","firstName":"Axel","lastName":"Flinth"},{"name":"Saeid Haghighatshoar","firstName":"Saeid","lastName":"Haghighatshoar"},{"name":"Giuseppe Caire","firstName":"Giuseppe","lastName":"Caire"},{"name":"Gitta Kutyniok","firstName":"Gitta","lastName":"Kutyniok"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-3-8007-4541-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8385450","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":102},"abstract":"The problem of wideband massive MIMO channel estimation is considered. Targeting for low complexity algorithms as well as small training overhead, a compressive sensing (CS) approach is pursued. Unfortunately, due to the Kroneckertype sensing (measurement) matrix corresponding to this setup, application of standard CS algorithms and analysis methodology does not apply. By recognizing that the channel possesses a special structure, termed hierarchical sparsity, we propose an efficient algorithm that explicitly takes into account this property. In addition, by extending the standard CS analysis methodology to hierarchical sparse vectors, we provide a rigorous analysis of the algorithm performance in terms of estimation error as well as number of pilot subcarriers required to achieve it. Small training overhead, in turn, means higher number of supported users in a cell and potentially improved pilot decontamination. We believe, that this is the first paper that draws a rigorous connection between the hierarchical framework and Kronecker measurements.

The system is configured such that each RF chain serves a group of antennas. The necessary condition to design the digital precoder is established based on a generalized water-filling and joint sum and per-antenna optimal power allocation solution, while the analog precoder is based on a perantenna power allocation solution only. We study the analytically most interesting case where the power constraint on the RF chain is smaller than the sum of the corresponding per-antenna power constraints. For this, the optimal power is allocated based on two properties: Each RF chain uses full power and if the optimal power allocation of the unconstraint problem violates a per-antenna power constraint then it is optimal to allocate the maximal power for that antenna.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Precoding Design for Massive MIMO Systems with Sub-connected Architecture and Per-antenna Power Constraints","publicationTitle":"WSA 2018; 22nd International ITG Workshop on Smart Antennas","displayPublicationTitle":"WSA 2018; 22nd International ITG Workshop on Smart Antennas","pdfPath":"/iel7/8385439/8385440/08385459.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8385440","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8385459","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"VDE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8385459/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-16 March 2018","displayDocTitle":"Precoding Design for Massive MIMO Systems with Sub-connected Architecture and Per-antenna Power Constraints","conferenceDate":"14-16 March 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"14 June 2018","publicationDate":"March 2018","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Precoding Design for Massive MIMO Systems with Sub-connected Architecture and Per-antenna Power Constraints","confLoc":"Bochum, Germany","sourcePdf":"454541019.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.027244S","chronDate":"14-16 March 2018","isNumber":"8385440","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8385439","citationCount":"3","articleId":"8385459","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"VDE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-09"},{"_id":8385460,"authors":[{"name":"Trinh Van Chien","firstName":"Trinh Van","lastName":"Chien"},{"name":"Emil Bjoernson","firstName":"Emil","lastName":"Bjoernson"},{"name":"Erik G.

Due to the characteristics of the 5G application scenarios, channel estimation techniques have been tested in Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) and Generalized Frequency Division Multiplexing (GFDM) systems. The orthogonality between subcarriers in OFDM systems permits inserting and extracting pilots without interference. However, due to pulse shaping, subcarriers in GFDM are no longer orthogonal and interfere with each other. Due to such interference, the channel estimation for GFDM is not trivial. A robust and low-complexity channel estimator can be obtained by combining a minimum mean-square error (MMSE) regularization and the basis expansion model (BEM) approach. In this work, we develop a BEM-type channel estimator along with a strategy to obtain the covariance matrix of the BEM coefficients. Simulations show that the BEM-type channel estimation shows performance close to that of the linear MMSE (LMMSE), even though there is no need to know the channel power delay profile, and its complexity is low.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8385440","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","displayPublicationTitle":"WSA 2018; 22nd International ITG Workshop on Smart Antennas","pdfPath":"/iel7/8385439/8385440/08385463.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"BEM-Based Channel Estimation for 5G Multicarrier Systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"VDE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8385463/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-16 March 2018","displayDocTitle":"BEM-Based Channel Estimation for 5G Multicarrier Systems","conferenceDate":"14-16 March 2018","publicationDate":"March 2018","dateOfInsertion":"14 June 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"BEM-Based Channel Estimation for 5G Multicarrier Systems","confLoc":"Bochum, Germany","sourcePdf":"454541023.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.01606S","chronDate":"14-16 March 2018","isNumber":"8385440","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8385439","citationCount":"1","articleId":"8385463","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"VDE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8385464,"authors":[{"name":"Omid Esrafilian","firstName":"Omid","lastName":"Esrafilian"},{"name":"David Gesbert","firstName":"David","lastName":"Gesbert"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-3-8007-4541-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8385464","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":310},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8385464","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8385440","publicationTitle":"WSA 2018; 22nd International ITG Workshop on Smart Antennas","displayPublicationTitle":"WSA 2018; 22nd International ITG Workshop on Smart Antennas","pdfPath":"/iel7/8385439/8385440/08385464.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Simultaneous User Association and Placement in Multi-UAV Enabled Wireless Networks","abstract":"In this paper, we are proposing a map-based approach for the optimal placement of multiple UAV-based flying wireless relays in a cellular network.

The technology for millimeter-wave massive MIMO systems is not yet available to the broad research community. Due to high path loss, sparsity of the channel, and restrictions of the hardware in the millimeter-wave band, new challenges in signal processing arise. One of these problems is the initial link acquisition also called beam alignment (BA). We present a hybrid analog-digital massive MIMO sub-6 GHz testbed with 64 antennas.

We demonstrate multiple BA algorithms to show their advantages and disadvantages. The testbed is based on a self-developed analog module with a high resolution of phase and amplitude settings.

It becomes essentially impossible by conventional extrapolation from past estimates if the car has moved by half a wavelength or more in space at the time when the channel estimate will be needed. This problem would prevent us from using the best fifth generation adaptive antenna downlink precoding schemes for very fast moving connected vehicles. A potential solution is to add another vehicle antenna, a \"predictor antenna\", which senses the channel in advance. In this paper, based on drive tests and channel measurements from a 64- element antenna to a car, we for the first time show that this concept works for massive MIMO downlinks. Thanks to the use of a predictor antenna, the complex OFDM downlink channels can be predicted with an accuracy that enables maximum ratio transmit beamforming with close to ideal beamforming gain for non-line-of-sight channels. Zero forcing transmission to two users results in a signal-to-interference ratio of 20 dB to 30 dB when predicting non-line-of-sight channels up to three wavelengths ahead in space. These first experiment shows that the predictor antenna concept is a potential solution to make fifth generation adaptive antennas work for very fast moving connected vehicles.","publicationTitle":"WSA 2018; 22nd International ITG Workshop on Smart Antennas","displayPublicationTitle":"WSA 2018; 22nd International ITG Workshop on Smart Antennas","pdfPath":"/iel7/8385439/8385440/08385489.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8385440","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive Massive MIMO for fast moving connected vehicles: It will work with Predictor Antennas!","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8385489","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"VDE","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-16 March 2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8385489/","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive Massive MIMO for fast moving connected vehicles: It will work with Predictor Antennas!","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"March 2018","conferenceDate":"14-16 March 2018","dateOfInsertion":"14 June 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive Massive MIMO for fast moving connected vehicles: It will work with Predictor Antennas!","confLoc":"Bochum, Germany","sourcePdf":"454541049.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051355S","chronDate":"14-16 March 2018","isNumber":"8385440","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8385439","citationCount":"1","articleId":"8385489","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"VDE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-09"},{"_id":8385492,"authors":[{"name":"Ahmed Raafat","firstName":"Ahmed","lastName":"Raafat"},{"name":"Adrian Agustin","firstName":"Adrian","lastName":"Agustin"},{"name":"Josep Vidal","firstName":"Josep","lastName":"Vidal"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-3-8007-4541-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8385492","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":194},"abstract":"Recently, a receive spatial modulation (RSM) for massive multiple-input-multiple-output operating in millimeter wave (mmWave) was introduced with the purpose of simplifying user terminal circuit by employing only one radio-frequency chain and attaining high spectral efficiency by exploiting the receive spatial dimension. However, when RSM is applied in a mmWave channel, it demands a challenging receive antenna selection (RAS) procedure. On the other hand, the power consumption at the transmitter side is high when a full digital (FD) precoder is envisioned. We consider the joint problem of RAS and precoder designs based low complexity hybrid architecture. For the sake of simplicity, we divide this problem into two subproblems. First, we design the RAS assuming FD precoder, and then, we design the hybrid precoder. We propose two novel and efficient RAS methods. First, we formulate the RAS as non-convex optimization problem. Then, we convert it into a convex optimization problem by introducing novel lower bounds and relaxing non-convex constraints. Second, we provide sequential algorithms that approach the optimal selection where we (add/remove) one (good/poor) antenna per iteration. We propose novel zero forcing hybrid precoder based convex optimization that maximizes the received power. We prove that the proposed precoder is optimal when the channel is highly spatially sparse. The proposed designs have been compared with the best known methods in terms of average mutual information and energy efficiency showing significant improvements.","publicationTitle":"WSA 2018; 22nd International ITG Workshop on Smart Antennas","displayPublicationTitle":"WSA 2018; 22nd International ITG Workshop on Smart Antennas","pdfPath":"/iel7/8385439/8385440/08385492.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8385440","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Receive Antenna Selection and Hybrid Precoding for Receive Spatial Modulation in Massive MIMO Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8385492","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"VDE","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-16 March 2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8385492/","displayDocTitle":"Receive Antenna Selection and Hybrid Precoding for Receive Spatial Modulation in Massive MIMO Systems","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"March 2018","conferenceDate":"14-16 March 2018","dateOfInsertion":"14 June 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Receive Antenna Selection and Hybrid Precoding for Receive Spatial Modulation in Massive MIMO Systems","confLoc":"Bochum, Germany","sourcePdf":"454541052.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041615S","chronDate":"14-16 March 2018","isNumber":"8385440","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8385439","citationCount":"1","articleId":"8385492","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"VDE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-09"},{"_id":8385498,"authors":[{"name":"Kamil Senel","firstName":"Kamil","lastName":"Senel"},{"name":"Erik G.

A key challenge of MTC, especially for the massive MTC (mMTC), is the detection of active devices among a large number of devices. The sparse characteristics of mMTC makes compressed sensing (CS) approaches a promising solution to the device detection problem. CS-based techniques are shown to outperform conventional device detection approaches. However, utilizing CS-based approaches for device detection along with channel estimation and using the acquired estimates for coherent data transmission may not be the optimal approach, especially for the cases where the goal is to convey only a few bits of data. In this work, we propose a non-coherent transmission technique for the mMTC uplink and compare its performance with coherent transmission. Furthermore, we demonstrate that it is possible to obtain more accurate channel state information by combining the conventional estimators with CS-based techniques.","publicationTitle":"WSA 2018; 22nd International ITG Workshop on Smart Antennas","displayPublicationTitle":"WSA 2018; 22nd International ITG Workshop on Smart Antennas","pdfPath":"/iel7/8385439/8385440/08385498.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8385440","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint User Activity and Non-Coherent Data Detection in mMTC-Enabled Massive MIMO Using Machine Learning Algorithms","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8385498","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"VDE","displayDocTitle":"Joint User Activity and Non-Coherent Data Detection in mMTC-Enabled Massive MIMO Using Machine Learning Algorithms","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-16 March 2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8385498/","conferenceDate":"14-16 March 2018","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"March 2018","dateOfInsertion":"14 June 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint User Activity and Non-Coherent Data Detection in mMTC-Enabled Massive MIMO Using Machine Learning Algorithms","confLoc":"Bochum, Germany","sourcePdf":"454541058.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.021953S","chronDate":"14-16 March 2018","isNumber":"8385440","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8385439","citationCount":"1","articleId":"8385498","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"VDE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-09"},{"_id":8385515,"authors":[{"name":"Mohammed Jabi","firstName":"Mohammed","lastName":"Jabi"},{"name":"Leszek Szczecinski","firstName":"Leszek","lastName":"Szczecinski"},{"name":"Mustapha Benjillali","firstName":"Mustapha","lastName":"Benjillali"},{"name":"Abdellatif Benyouss","firstName":"Abdellatif","lastName":"Benyouss"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-3-8007-4560-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8385515","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":64},"abstract":"In this work, we consider transmissions over block fading channels and assume that adaptive modulation and coding (AMC) and hybrid automatic repeat request (HARQ) are implemented. Knowing that in high signal-to-noise ratio, the conventional combination of HARQ with AMC is counterproductive from the throughput point of view, we adopt a layercoding strategy. Such a layered-coded HARQ (L-HARQ) allows consecutive packets to share the channel and preserves a great degree of separation between AMC and HARQ; this makes the encoding and decoding very simple and allows us to use the available/optimized codes. Numerical examples shown in the paper indicate that L-HARQ can provide significant throughput gains compared to the conventional HARQ.","publicationTitle":"European Wireless 2018; 24th European Wireless Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"European Wireless 2018; 24th European Wireless Conference","pdfPath":"/iel7/8385513/8385514/08385515.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8385514","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Throughput Increase Through Layered Coding for AMC with HARQ","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8385515","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"VDE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-4 May 2018","displayDocTitle":"Throughput Increase Through Layered Coding for AMC with HARQ","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8385515/","publicationDate":"May 2018","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"14 June 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","conferenceDate":"2-4 May 2018","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Throughput Increase Through Layered Coding for AMC with HARQ","confLoc":"Catania, Italy","sourcePdf":"564560001.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.091792S","chronDate":"2-4 May 2018","isNumber":"8385514","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8385513","articleId":"8385515","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"VDE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":8385516,"authors":[{"name":"Fulvio Babich","firstName":"Fulvio","lastName":"Babich"},{"name":"Massimiliano Comisso","firstName":"Massimiliano","lastName":"Comisso"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-3-8007-4560-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8385516","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":67},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8385516","displayPublicationTitle":"European Wireless 2018; 24th European Wireless Conference","pdfPath":"/iel7/8385513/8385514/08385516.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8385514","publicationTitle":"European Wireless 2018; 24th European Wireless Conference","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Coded Slotted Aloha (CSA) with Capture","abstract":"The Coded Slotted Aloha (CSA) scheme has been proposed for the uncoordinated, non orthogonal multiple access.

In the literature, the CSA performance has been evaluated assuming the conventional erasure channel. Purpose of this paper is to extend the evaluation to the more realistic capture channel. To this aim, two approaches are considered: an ideal full capture one, in which the position of the segments is known by the receiver, and a mixed approach, in which the reception of a single uncollided segment is required. A code redesign is also proposed for the situation in which the nodes transmit with a constant power, while, the more general scenario characterized by fading and power diversity is investigated by extensive Monte Carlo evaluations.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"VDE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8385516/","conferenceDate":"2-4 May 2018","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-4 May 2018","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"14 June 2018","publicationDate":"May 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Coded Slotted Aloha (CSA) with Capture","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Coded Slotted Aloha (CSA) with Capture","confLoc":"Catania, Italy","sourcePdf":"564560002.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.019873S","chronDate":"2-4 May 2018","isNumber":"8385514","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8385513","articleId":"8385516","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"VDE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":8385517,"authors":[{"name":"Stanislav Kruglik","firstName":"Stanislav","lastName":"Kruglik"},{"name":"Valeriya Potapova","firstName":"Valeriya","lastName":"Potapova"},{"name":"Alexey Frolov","firstName":"Alexey","lastName":"Frolov"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-3-8007-4560-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8385517","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":97},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8385517","displayPublicationTitle":"European Wireless 2018; 24th European Wireless Conference","pdfPath":"/iel7/8385513/8385514/08385517.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8385514","publicationTitle":"European Wireless 2018; 24th European Wireless Conference","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On Performance of Multilevel Coding Schemes Based on Non-Binary LDPC Codes","abstract":"We address the problem of constructing of coding schemes for the channels with high-order modulations. It is known, that non-binary LDPC codes are especially good for such channels and significantly outperform their binary counterparts. Unfortunately, their decoding complexity is still large. In order to reduce the decoding complexity we consider multilevel coding schemes based on non-binary LDPC codes (NB-LDPC-MLC schemes) over smaller fields. The use of such schemes gives us a reasonable gain in complexity. At the same time the performance of NB-LDPC-MLC schemes is practically the same as the performance of LDPC codes over the field matching the modulation order. In particular by means of simulations we showed that the performance of NB-LDPC-MLC schemes over GF(16) is the same as the performance of non-binary LDPC codes over GF(exp 64) and GF(exp 256) in AWGN channel with QAM (exp 64) and QAM 256 accordingly.

V2X communication refers to the exchange of information between vehicle and infrastructure (V2I) or between vehicles (V2V). Network slicing is one of the promising technologies for the next generation of connected devices, creating several logical networks on a common and programmable physical infrastructure. Following this idea, we propose a network slicing based communication model for vehicular networks. In this paper, we have modelled a multi-lane highway scenario with vehicles having heterogeneous traffic requirements. Autonomous driving slice (exchanges safety messages) and infotainment slice (provides video stream) are the two logical slices created on a common infrastructure. In addition, a relaying approach is utilized to improve the performance of low signal-to-interferenceplus- noise-ratio (SINR) video streaming vehicles. These low SINR vehicles are served by other infotainment vehicles, which have high quality V2V and V2I link and are not serving as autonomous driving slice access point. An extensive Long Term Evolution Advanced (LTE-A) system level simulator is used to evaluate the performance of the proposed method, in which it is shown that the proposed network slicing approach increases the packet reception ratio (PRR) from 31.15% to 99.47%.","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","publicationTitle":"European Wireless 2018; 24th European Wireless Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"European Wireless 2018; 24th European Wireless Conference","pdfPath":"/iel7/8385513/8385514/08385521.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8385514","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the Application of Network Slicing for 5G-V2X","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"VDE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8385521/","conferenceDate":"2-4 May 2018","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-4 May 2018","displayDocTitle":"On the Application of Network Slicing for 5G-V2X","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"14 June 2018","publicationDate":"May 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the Application of Network Slicing for 5G-V2X","confLoc":"Catania, Italy","sourcePdf":"564560007.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.018095S","chronDate":"2-4 May 2018","isNumber":"8385514","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8385513","citationCount":"3","articleId":"8385521","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"VDE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8385522,"authors":[{"name":"Hassan Fawaz","firstName":"Hassan","lastName":"Fawaz"},{"name":"Samer Lahoud","firstName":"Samer","lastName":"Lahoud"},{"name":"Melhem El Helou","firstName":"Melhem","lastName":"El Helou"},{"name":"Marc Ibrahim","firstName":"Marc","lastName":"Ibrahim"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-3-8007-4560-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8385522","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":43},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8385522","abstract":"Scheduling in full-duplex networks is essential for efficiently managing resources, and for mitigating interference problems.

Among its main features, JSDM requires to partition mobile users into groups, based on the channel covariance similarity. To this end, the Density-Based Clustering of Applications With Noise (DBSCAN) clustering algorithm has already proved to be reasonably suitable. Unfortunately, DBSCAN falls short in challenging situations, like a large homogeneous crowd of users. Here, in fact, all the users are put in the same group despite experiencing different channel covariances, which degrades the behavior of JSDM. Based on these premises, the contribution presented herein proposes a modified version of DBSCAN, which enforces a maximum size on detected clusters by limiting the difference in channel covariances between any pair of users in the same group. In line with the requirements of JSDM, the modified DBSCAN breaks down excessively large clusters into smaller ones, thus extending its applicability to a much wider range of scenarios (from small dispersed user groups to large compact ones). Computer simulations confirm the behavior predicted by the theoretical formulation: the proposed approach reaches a better user and system spectral efficiency, while showing low sensitivity against parameter tuning.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Density Based Clustering for Downlink User Grouping in FDD Massive MIMO","publicationTitle":"European Wireless 2018; 24th European Wireless Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"European Wireless 2018; 24th European Wireless Conference","pdfPath":"/iel7/8385513/8385514/08385523.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8385514","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8385523","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"VDE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8385523/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-4 May 2018","displayDocTitle":"Density Based Clustering for Downlink User Grouping in FDD Massive MIMO","conferenceDate":"2-4 May 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"14 June 2018","publicationDate":"May 2018","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Density Based Clustering for Downlink User Grouping in FDD Massive MIMO","confLoc":"Catania, Italy","sourcePdf":"564560009.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.027107S","chronDate":"2-4 May 2018","isNumber":"8385514","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8385513","citationCount":"1","articleId":"8385523","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"VDE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":8385525,"authors":[{"name":"Jorge F.

We argue that this, together with inherent features that are not easy to replicate by other physical layers, position UWB as a promising industrial communications technology.","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","publicationTitle":"European Wireless 2018; 24th European Wireless Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"European Wireless 2018; 24th European Wireless Conference","pdfPath":"/iel7/8385513/8385514/08385525.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8385514","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Experimental Study of UWB Connectivity in Industrial Environments","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"VDE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8385525/","conferenceDate":"2-4 May 2018","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-4 May 2018","displayDocTitle":"Experimental Study of UWB Connectivity in Industrial Environments","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"14 June 2018","publicationDate":"May 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Experimental Study of UWB Connectivity in Industrial Environments","confLoc":"Catania, Italy","sourcePdf":"564560011.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054784S","chronDate":"2-4 May 2018","isNumber":"8385514","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8385513","articleId":"8385525","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"VDE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8385530,"authors":[{"name":"Michal Vondra","firstName":"Michal","lastName":"Vondra"},{"name":"Ergin Dinc","firstName":"Ergin","lastName":"Dinc"},{"name":"Cicek Cavdar","firstName":"Cicek","lastName":"Cavdar"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-3-8007-4560-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8385530","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":152},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8385530","displayPublicationTitle":"European Wireless 2018; 24th European Wireless Conference","pdfPath":"/iel7/8385513/8385514/08385530.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8385514","publicationTitle":"European Wireless 2018; 24th European Wireless Conference","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Coordinated Resource Allocation Scheme for 5G Direct Air-to-Ground Communication","abstract":"There is an increasing demand for in-flight broadband connectivity. Some airlines are already deployed satellite-based solutions, which have low data rate and high latency. In order to tackle these problems, direct air-to-ground communication (DA2GC), where a direct link between a ground station and an airplane is established, is a promising solution. The resource utilization in DA2GC systems can be enhanced with the introduction of multi-user beamforming techniques, where each airplane has its dedicated beam and exploits a larger portion of the spectrum available to DA2GC. Even with multiuser beamforming technique, some airplanes may experience low data rates due to interference caused by beams aimed at airplanes in the mutual vicinity. The probability that two or more beams will interfere is higher with longer inter-site distance or wider beamwidth, which is often the case for DA2GC systems. To address significant research problem, we propose a coordinated resource allocation scheme with beam selection and spectrum allocation. The proposed beam selection scheme coordinates the neighboring base stations such that the number of airplanes sharing the same beam is minimized. In addition, the proposed coordinated spectrum allocation scheme maximizes the minimum amount of spectrum dedicated for each airplane. According to our results, the proposed coordinated beam selection with efficient spectrum allocation improves average capacity available per airplane by 60% in comparison with the uncoordinated scheme.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"VDE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8385530/","conferenceDate":"2-4 May 2018","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-4 May 2018","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"14 June 2018","publicationDate":"May 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Coordinated Resource Allocation Scheme for 5G Direct Air-to-Ground Communication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Coordinated Resource Allocation Scheme for 5G Direct Air-to-Ground Communication","confLoc":"Catania, Italy","sourcePdf":"564560016.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.018491S","chronDate":"2-4 May 2018","isNumber":"8385514","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8385513","articleId":"8385530","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"VDE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8385532,"authors":[{"name":"Raul Parada","firstName":"Raul","lastName":"Parada"},{"name":"Michele Zorzi","firstName":"Michele","lastName":"Zorzi"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-3-8007-4560-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8385532","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":166},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8385532","abstract":"By 2020, the global mobile data traffic will reach 30.6 exabytes per month. Hence, microwave bands will become saturated and insufficient to deliver that increment of data. Millimeter wave (a.k.a. mmWave) is a promising band, from 30 to 300 GHz, to allocate that data. A drawback is the high attenuation in non-line-of-sight scenarios because the millimeter wavelengths are blocked by common obstacles. Opposite to Long Term Evolution (LTE) networks, which transmit in an isotropic manner, mmWave small base stations (SBS) have to transmit through directional antennas to increase the signal to noise ratio, reaching a radius up to 200 meters. Hence, hundreds of SBSs will be needed to cover large spaces, and as a consequence, a user equipment (UE) will perform several handover (HO) procedures in a short distance. This requires an algorithm to decrease the handover delay for increasing the UE quality of service. We propose a direction of pass detection algorithm which predicts the next base station that the UE will approach for a faster detection. Our low-complexity algorithm is based on a linear regression model which uniquely uses the detection of the UE as input information, avoiding power consuming functions such as accelerometer sensors and global positioning systems in battery-limited devices to provide additional data. Results returned a 64% and 60% prediction accuracy with low and high outage probability, respectively. Our prediction algorithm also reduces the HO delay when an exhaustive-search algorithm is implemented.","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","publicationTitle":"European Wireless 2018; 24th European Wireless Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"European Wireless 2018; 24th European Wireless Conference","pdfPath":"/iel7/8385513/8385514/08385532.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8385514","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Context-aware Handover in mmWave 5G Using UE's Direction of Pass","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"VDE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8385532/","conferenceDate":"2-4 May 2018","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-4 May 2018","displayDocTitle":"Context-aware Handover in mmWave 5G Using UE's Direction of Pass","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"14 June 2018","publicationDate":"May 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Context-aware Handover in mmWave 5G Using UE's Direction of Pass","confLoc":"Catania, Italy","sourcePdf":"564560018.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.03662S","chronDate":"2-4 May 2018","isNumber":"8385514","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8385513","articleId":"8385532","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"VDE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-08-21"},{"_id":8385533,"authors":[{"name":"Hossein Soleimani","firstName":"Hossein","lastName":"Soleimani"},{"name":"Raul Parada","firstName":"Raul","lastName":"Parada"},{"name":"Stefano Tomasin","firstName":"Stefano","lastName":"Tomasin"},{"name":"Michele Zorzi","firstName":"Michele","lastName":"Zorzi"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-3-8007-4560-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8385533","dbTime":"1 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":166},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8385533","abstract":"MmWave communication systems overcome high attenuation by using multiple antennas with beamforming at both the transmitter and the receiver. Upon entrance of a user equipment (UE) into a cell, the base station scans the space in order to find the UE, in what is known as initial access (IA) procedure. In this paper, we start from the observation that UEs are more likely to enter from some directions than others, as they typically move along streets, while other movements are impossible due to the presence of obstacles. Moreover, users are entering with a given time statistics. In this context, we propose scanning strategies for IA that take into account the entrance statistics. In particular, we propose two approaches: a memory-less random illumination (MLRI) algorithm and a statistic and memory-based illumination (SMBI) algorithm. The MLRI algorithm scans a random sector in each slot, based on the statistics of sector entrance, without memory. The SMBI algorithm instead scans sectors in a deterministic sequence selected according to the statistics of sector entrance and time of entrance and taking into account the fact that the user has not yet been discovered (thus including memory). We assess the performance of the proposed methods in terms of misdetection and false alarm probability and average discovery time.","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","publicationTitle":"European Wireless 2018; 24th European Wireless Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"European Wireless 2018; 24th European Wireless Conference","pdfPath":"/iel7/8385513/8385514/08385533.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8385514","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Statistical Approaches for Initial Access in mmWave 5G Systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"VDE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8385533/","conferenceDate":"2-4 May 2018","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-4 May 2018","displayDocTitle":"Statistical Approaches for Initial Access in mmWave 5G Systems","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"14 June 2018","publicationDate":"May 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Statistical Approaches for Initial Access in mmWave 5G Systems","confLoc":"Catania, Italy","sourcePdf":"564560019.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.014484S","chronDate":"2-4 May 2018","isNumber":"8385514","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8385513","citationCount":"3","articleId":"8385533","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"VDE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8385536,"authors":[{"name":"Sergio Martiradonna","firstName":"Sergio","lastName":"Martiradonna"},{"name":"Alessandro Grassi","firstName":"Alessandro","lastName":"Grassi"},{"name":"Giuseppe Piro","firstName":"Giuseppe","lastName":"Piro"},{"name":"Luigi Alfredo Grieco","firstName":"Luigi Alfredo","lastName":"Grieco"},{"name":"Gennaro Boggia","firstName":"Gennaro","lastName":"Boggia"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-3-8007-4560-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8385536","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":351},"abstract":"Applications and services emerged in the Internet of Things era are introducing new challenging requirements to the current communication technologies. Since a high number of devices are intentioned to sporadically send small data packets, the transmission speed goes at a secondary level of importance. Instead, more attention is devoted to coverage, computational complexity, and energy constraints. In this context, the 3rd Generation Partnership Project is complementing existing mobile systems with a novel technology, namely NarrowBand Internet of Things (NB-IoT), which is expected to be more suitable for Internet of Things scenarios. While it is getting more and more attention from academia and industry, there is an increasing need to have flexible instruments for designing and testing protocols and algorithms for the NB-IoT stack. To this end, the work discussed herein proposes an open source simulator for NB-IoT, conceived starting from the well-known LTE-Sim tool. At the present stage, it implements uplink transmission with both Single-Tone and Multi-Tone configurations, random access procedure, and baseline scheduling, while offering the support for multi carrier, stand alone, in band, and guard band operating modes. The tool has been used for evaluating the performance of reference NB-IoT scenarios. Obtained results highlight the impact of traffic load and system configurations on network performance.","publicationTitle":"European Wireless 2018; 24th European Wireless Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"European Wireless 2018; 24th European Wireless Conference","pdfPath":"/iel7/8385513/8385514/08385536.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8385514","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Open Source Platform for Exploring NB-IoT System Performance","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8385536","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"VDE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-4 May 2018","displayDocTitle":"An Open Source Platform for Exploring NB-IoT System Performance","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8385536/","publicationDate":"May 2018","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"14 June 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","conferenceDate":"2-4 May 2018","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Open Source Platform for Exploring NB-IoT System Performance","confLoc":"Catania, Italy","sourcePdf":"564560022.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.029667S","chronDate":"2-4 May 2018","isNumber":"8385514","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8385513","citationCount":"3","articleId":"8385536","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"VDE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8385538,"authors":[{"name":"Sebastiano Milardo","firstName":"Sebastiano","lastName":"Milardo"},{"name":"Akhilesh Venkatasubramanian","firstName":"Akhilesh","lastName":"Venkatasubramanian"},{"name":"Krithika Vijayan","firstName":"Krithika","lastName":"Vijayan"},{"name":"Prabagarane Nagaradjane","firstName":"Prabagarane","lastName":"Nagaradjane"},{"name":"Giacomo Morabito","firstName":"Giacomo","lastName":"Morabito"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-3-8007-4560-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8385538","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":195},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8385538","abstract":"The Software Defined Networking paradigm (SDN) is recognized as one of the main forces that can simplify the management of wired and wireless networks.

A further step in the simplification of the management is the design of a framework that can automatize the control of the network by leveraging the information gathered at the SDN controller combined with machine learning techniques. In this paper a solution is introduced that learns and predicts recurrent patterns in network load and decides which are the best policies to be implemented in order to reach a given objective.

In this paper, we propose a new user selection algorithm based on knowledge of the geometry of the service area and location of clusters, without having full channel state information (CSI) at the base station (BS). The multiuser link correlation in the GSCMs arises from the common clusters in the area. The throughput depends on the position of clusters in the GSCMs and users in the system. Simulation results show that although the BS does not require the channel information of all users, by the proposed geometry-based user scheduling algorithm the sum-rate of the system is only slightly less than the well-known greedy weight clique scheme.

In such cases, the transmissions between source and destination can employ multiple paths. The throughput in a scenario like this can be maximised with application of Opportunistic Routing (OpR). In high density networks, the OpR uses the diversity of the broadcast channel to increase the achievable data rates in comparison to traditional routing solutions. However, the header size of the routing messages increases when the density grows. The reduction of this overhead could potentially improve the overall throughput and decrease the battery usage of network heavy applications via diminished wireless interface activity. Normally, header compression is employed to minimise the overhead of IP-based cellular traffic between two connected peers. This paper presents for the first time the application of header compression concepts to an opportunistic routing protocol. We use a packet erasure channel simulator to employ these header compression techniques on the routing messages based on real world mesh network traces. We thereby decrease the size of the routing messages in these simulated topologies and find that they can reduce the size of transmission heavy header elements by at least 50 % and can be even as high as 85 % under certain conditions. This increases the potential of opportunistic routing in very large mesh networks, as the reduction in feedback message sizes would increase the maximum achievable data rates exponentially.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8385514","publicationTitle":"European Wireless 2018; 24th European Wireless Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"European Wireless 2018; 24th European Wireless Conference","pdfPath":"/iel7/8385513/8385514/08385545.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Header Compression in Opportunistic Routing","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"VDE","conferenceDate":"2-4 May 2018","displayDocTitle":"Header Compression in Opportunistic Routing","isConference":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"2-4 May 2018","dateOfInsertion":"14 June 2018","publicationDate":"May 2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8385545/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Header Compression in Opportunistic Routing","confLoc":"Catania, Italy","sourcePdf":"564560031.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.030442S","chronDate":"2-4 May 2018","isNumber":"8385514","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8385513","articleId":"8385545","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"VDE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-08-21"},{"_id":8385547,"authors":[{"name":"Pavel Masek","firstName":"Pavel","lastName":"Masek"},{"name":"David Hudec","firstName":"David","lastName":"Hudec"},{"name":"Jan Krejci","firstName":"Jan","lastName":"Krejci"},{"name":"Aleksandr Ometov","firstName":"Aleksandr","lastName":"Ometov"},{"name":"Jiri Hosek","firstName":"Jiri","lastName":"Hosek"},{"name":"Sergey Andreev","firstName":"Sergey","lastName":"Andreev"},{"name":"Franz Kroepfl","firstName":"Franz","lastName":"Kroepfl"},{"name":"Yevgeni Koucheryavy","firstName":"Yevgeni","lastName":"Koucheryavy"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-3-8007-4560-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8385547","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":78},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8385547","abstract":"Current forecasts predict that the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) will comprise about 10 billion devices by 2020.

As utility companies lack these features, our software implementation and hardware design open the door to initial verification of WM-Bus-based data transmissions for them without the need for investing into expensive development and certification of smart meters, where WM-Bus is utilized for data transmissions.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8385514","publicationTitle":"European Wireless 2018; 24th European Wireless Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"European Wireless 2018; 24th European Wireless Conference","pdfPath":"/iel7/8385513/8385514/08385547.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Advanced Wireless M-Bus Platform for Intensive Field Testing in Industry 4.0-Based Systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"VDE","conferenceDate":"2-4 May 2018","displayDocTitle":"Advanced Wireless M-Bus Platform for Intensive Field Testing in Industry 4.0-Based Systems","isConference":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"2-4 May 2018","dateOfInsertion":"14 June 2018","publicationDate":"May 2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8385547/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Advanced Wireless M-Bus Platform for Intensive Field Testing in Industry 4.0-Based Systems","confLoc":"Catania, Italy","sourcePdf":"564560033.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.036716S","chronDate":"2-4 May 2018","isNumber":"8385514","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8385513","articleId":"8385547","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"VDE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8385549,"authors":[{"name":"Yevgeniya Sulema","firstName":"Yevgeniya","lastName":"Sulema"},{"name":"Noam Amram","firstName":"Noam","lastName":"Amram"},{"name":"Oleksii Aleshchenko","firstName":"Oleksii","lastName":"Aleshchenko"},{"name":"Olena Sivak","firstName":"Olena","lastName":"Sivak"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-3-8007-4560-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8385549","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":166},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8385549","displayPublicationTitle":"European Wireless 2018; 24th European Wireless Conference","pdfPath":"/iel7/8385513/8385514/08385549.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8385514","publicationTitle":"European Wireless 2018; 24th European Wireless Conference","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Quality of Experience Estimation for WebRTC-based Video Streaming","abstract":"Enabling high Quality of experience (QoE) for video streaming, which accounts for a large and increasing percentage of wireless traffic, anywhere and anytime is a challenging task for relatively new Web Real-Time Communication (WebRTC) protocols as well as for service providers and it triggers broad exploration of this area. In this paper, we present our experience in running experiments for estimation of QoE for a WebRTC video stream in Mobile Broadband (MBB) networks based on Quality of Service (QoS) measurements. For majority of our experiments we exploited the MONROE platform, which is the first open access platform that gives access to several hundreds of nodes for large-scale experiments in commercial MBB in Europe. For analysis of obtained QoS measurements we used a combination of subjective quality assessment and a machine learning approach.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"VDE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8385549/","conferenceDate":"2-4 May 2018","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-4 May 2018","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"14 June 2018","publicationDate":"May 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Quality of Experience Estimation for WebRTC-based Video Streaming","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Quality of Experience Estimation for WebRTC-based Video Streaming","confLoc":"Catania, Italy","sourcePdf":"564560035.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.02914S","chronDate":"2-4 May 2018","isNumber":"8385514","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8385513","citationCount":"2","articleId":"8385549","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"VDE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8385551,"authors":[{"name":"Polychronis Valsamas","firstName":"Polychronis","lastName":"Valsamas"},{"name":"Sotiris Skaperas","firstName":"Sotiris","lastName":"Skaperas"},{"name":"Lefteris Mamatas","firstName":"Lefteris","lastName":"Mamatas"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-3-8007-4560-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8385551","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":51},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8385551","displayPublicationTitle":"European Wireless 2018; 24th European Wireless Conference","pdfPath":"/iel7/8385513/8385514/08385551.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8385514","publicationTitle":"European Wireless 2018; 24th European Wireless Conference","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Elastic Content Distribution Based on Unikernels and Change-Point Analysis","abstract":"The emerging 5G networks call for new approaches to CDNs through addressing challenging issues, such as: (i) scalable and holistic resource management, spanning from large data centers to the user device, including edge clouds; (ii) incorporation of heterogeneous physical and virtual resources; (iii) extensibility to support new capabilities or mechanisms; and (iv) adaptability to dynamic user requirements, server resources and network capacity constraints. User-generated content is the driving force for new services, while edge cloud solutions are being proposed to host (or cache) content locally. However, it is costly to deploy traditional clouds near end-users and such virtual machines (VMs) are inefficient for dynamic network conditions (i.e., may boot-up in minutes). Here, we propose an elastic content distribution platform that serves the Internet content using tiny Unikernel-based VMs. Such VMs are hosting one or a few videos each, appear rapidly in nearby cloud deployments, serve users and then disappear. In other words, the studied environment provides content dissemination through very dynamic, almost \"fluid\" VM placement, since the content is packaged with the server software with just a minor increase in size. So, we reposition the content caching and provisioning as a VM orchestration problem. We demonstrate the complete implementation of the proposed platform with proofof- concept experimental results.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"VDE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8385551/","conferenceDate":"2-4 May 2018","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-4 May 2018","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"14 June 2018","publicationDate":"May 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Elastic Content Distribution Based on Unikernels and Change-Point Analysis","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Elastic Content Distribution Based on Unikernels and Change-Point Analysis","confLoc":"Catania, Italy","sourcePdf":"564560037.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.01651S","chronDate":"2-4 May 2018","isNumber":"8385514","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8385513","articleId":"8385551","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"VDE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":8385552,"authors":[{"name":"Umber Noreen","firstName":"Umber","lastName":"Noreen"},{"name":"Laurent Clavier","firstName":"Laurent","lastName":"Clavier"},{"name":"Ahcene Bounceur","firstName":"Ahcene","lastName":"Bounceur"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-3-8007-4560-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8385552","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":473},"abstract":"Long Range communications are taking an important place in the IoT world.

However, sensing the channel will not resolve the collision problem because of the very wide coverage of access points. We study how capture effect and even more serial interference cancellation can drastically improve the performance. The position randomness of transmitters can allow to correctly decode simultaneous transmissions.","publicationTitle":"European Wireless 2018; 24th European Wireless Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"European Wireless 2018; 24th European Wireless Conference","pdfPath":"/iel7/8385513/8385514/08385552.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8385514","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"LoRa-like CSS-based PHY layer, Capture Effect and Serial Interference Cancellation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8385552","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"VDE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-4 May 2018","displayDocTitle":"LoRa-like CSS-based PHY layer, Capture Effect and Serial Interference Cancellation","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8385552/","publicationDate":"May 2018","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"14 June 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","conferenceDate":"2-4 May 2018","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"LoRa-like CSS-based PHY layer, Capture Effect and Serial Interference Cancellation","confLoc":"Catania, Italy","sourcePdf":"564560038.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057343S","chronDate":"2-4 May 2018","isNumber":"8385514","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8385513","citationCount":"8","articleId":"8385552","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"VDE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8385941,"authors":[{"name":"Toshiaki Koike-Akino","affiliation":["Mitsubishi Electric Research Laboratories (MERL), Cambridge, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Toshiaki","lastName":"Koike-Akino","id":"38266933200"},{"name":"David S.

Massive MIMO has the potential to mitigate the interference in the network and enhance the average throughput per user. On the other hand, dynamic time-division duplexing (TDD), which allows neighboring cells to operate with different uplink (UL) and downlink (DL) subframe configurations, is a promising enhancement for the conventional static TDD. Compared with static TDD, dynamic TDD can offer more flexibility to accommodate various UL and DL traffic patterns across different cells, but may result in additional interference among cells transmitting in different directions. Based on the unique characteristics and properties of massive MIMO and dynamic TDD, we propose a marriage of these two techniques, i.e., to have massive MIMO address the limitation of dynamic TDD in macrocell (MC) networks. Specifically, we advocate that the benefits of dynamic TDD can be fully extracted in MC networks equipped with massive MIMO, i.e., the BS-to-BS interference can be effectively removed by increasing the number of BS antennas. We provide detailed analysis using random matrix theory to show that the effect of the BS-to-BS interference on UL transmissions vanishes as the number of BS antennas per user grows infinitely large. Last but not least, we validate our analysis by numerical simulations.","doi":"10.1109/JSYST.2018.2829350","publicationTitle":"IEEE Systems Journal","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Systems Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/4267003/8649702/08386423.pdf","startPage":"117","endPage":"124","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSYST.2018.2829350","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8649702","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reaping the Benefits of Dynamic TDD in Massive MIMO","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8386423","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 June 2018","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2019","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8386423/","displayDocTitle":"Reaping the Benefits of Dynamic TDD in Massive MIMO","volume":"13","issue":"1","publicationDate":"March 2019","accessionNumber":"18471198","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8386423/","dateOfInsertion":"22 February 2019","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reaping the Benefits of Dynamic TDD in Massive MIMO","sourcePdf":"jsyst-samani-2829350-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.115243S","chronDate":"March  2019","xplore-pub-id":"4267003","isNumber":"8649702","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4267003","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"8649702","articleId":"8386423","onlineDate":"14 June 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8386424,"authors":[{"name":"Michael Kampffmeyer","affiliation":["Machine Learning Group, UiT The Arctic University of Norway, Troms\u00f8, Norway"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4609443/8401947/8386424/kampf-2834961-small.gif","p":["Michael Kampffmeyer (S\u201917) received the Master's degrees\n from the Department of Physics and Technology and the Department of Computer Science, UiT The Arctic University of\n Norway, Troms\u00f8, Norway, in 2014 and 2015, respectively, where he is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree\n in machine learning.","His research interests include the development of unsupervised deep learning methods for representation learning and\n clustering by utilizing ideas from kernel machines and information theoretic learning.

The problem is highly challenging, as classes generally have high interclass and low intraclass variances. Techniques to improve urban land cover classification performance in remote sensing include fusion of data from different sensors with different data modalities. However, such techniques require all modalities to be available to the classifier in the decision-making process, i.e., at test time, as well as in training. If a data modality is missing at test time, current state-of-the-art approaches have in general no procedure available for exploiting information from these modalities. This represents a waste of potentially useful information. We propose as a remedy a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture for urban land cover classification which is able to embed all available training modalities in the so-called hallucination network. The network will in effect replace missing data modalities in the test phase, enabling fusion capabilities even when data modalities are missing in testing. We demonstrate the method using two datasets consisting of optical and digital surface model (DSM) images. We simulate missing modalities by assuming that DSM images are missing during testing. Our method outperforms both standard CNNs trained only on optical images as well as an ensemble of two standard CNNs. We further evaluate the potential of our method to handle situations where only some DSM images are missing during testing. Overall, we show that we can clearly exploit training time information of the missing modality during testing.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel7/4609443/8401947/08386424.pdf","startPage":"1758","endPage":"1768","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Urban Land Cover Classification With Missing Data Modalities Using Deep Convolutional Neural Networks","doi":"10.1109/JSTARS.2018.2834961","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8401947","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSTARS.2018.2834961","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8386424","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8386424/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 June 2018","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2018","displayDocTitle":"Urban Land Cover Classification With Missing Data Modalities Using Deep Convolutional Neural Networks","dateOfInsertion":"03 July 2018","publicationDate":"June 2018","accessionNumber":"17895025","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"11","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/8386424/","isJournal":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Norwegian Research Council FRIPRO","grantNumber":"239844"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Urban Land Cover Classification With Missing Data Modalities Using Deep Convolutional Neural Networks","sourcePdf":"jstars-kampffmeyer-2834961-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.105417S","chronDate":"June  2018","xplore-pub-id":"4609443","isNumber":"8401947","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4609443","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"8401947","articleId":"8386424","onlineDate":"14 June 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8386437,"authors":[{"name":"Yu Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Psychiatry and Behavior Sciences, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6221036/8732614/8386437/zhang-2841847-small.gif","p":["Yu Zhang received the Ph.D. degree in control science and engineering from the East China University of Science and Technology, Shanghai, China, in 2013.","He was a Post-Doctoral Research Fellow with Biomedical Research Imaging Center, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC, USA, from 2016 to 2017.

The effectiveness of CSP is highly affected by the frequency band and time window of EEG segments. Although numerous algorithms have been designed to optimize the spectral bands of CSP, most of them selected the time window in a heuristic way. This is likely to result in a suboptimal feature extraction since the time period when the brain responses to the mental tasks occurs may not be accurately detected. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm, namely temporally constrained sparse group spatial pattern (TSGSP), for the simultaneous optimization of filter bands and time window within CSP to further boost classification accuracy of MI EEG. Specifically, spectrum-specific signals are first derived by bandpass filtering from raw EEG data at a set of overlapping filter bands. Each of the spectrum-specific signals is further segmented into multiple subseries using sliding window approach. We then devise a joint sparse optimization of filter bands and time windows with temporal smoothness constraint to extract robust CSP features under a multitask learning framework. A linear support vector machine classifier is trained on the optimized EEG features to accurately identify the MI tasks. An experimental study is implemented on three public EEG datasets (BCI Competition III dataset IIIa, BCI Competition IV datasets IIa, and BCI Competition IV dataset IIb) to validate the effectiveness of TSGSP in comparison to several other competing methods. Superior classification performance (averaged accuracies are 88.5%, 83.3%, and 84.3% for the three datasets, respectively) based on the experimental results confirms that the proposed algorithm is a promising candidate for performance improvement of MI-based BCIs.","doi":"10.1109/TCYB.2018.2841847","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCYB.2018.2841847","startPage":"3322","endPage":"3332","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics","pdfPath":"/iel7/6221036/8732614/08386437.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8732614","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Temporally Constrained Sparse Group Spatial Patterns for Motor Imagery BCI","chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/6221036/8732614/8386437-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8386437/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2019","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 June 2018","displayDocTitle":"Temporally Constrained Sparse Group Spatial Patterns for Motor Imagery BCI","volume":"49","issue":"9","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 June 2019","accessionNumber":"18756861","pubMedId":"29994667","publicationDate":"Sept. 2019","htmlLink":"/document/8386437/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"91420302 and 61573142"},{"fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities","grantNumber":"WH1516018 and 222201717006"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"IIS-1421948 and BCS-1551688"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003443","fundingName":"Ministry of Education and Science of the Russian Federation","grantNumber":"14.756.31.0001"},{"fundingName":"Polish National Science Center","grantNumber":"2016/20/W/N24/00354"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","chorusFlag":"true","title":"Temporally Constrained Sparse Group Spatial Patterns for Motor Imagery BCI","sourcePdf":"tcyb-zhang-2841847-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.260136S","chronDate":"Sept.  2019","xplore-pub-id":"6221036","isNumber":"8732614","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6221036","citationCount":"40","xplore-issue":"8732614","articleId":"8386437","onlineDate":"14 June 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8386441,"authors":[{"name":"Zhijun Zhang","affiliation":["School of Automation Science and Engineering, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou Key Laboratory of Brain Computer Interaction and Applications, Guangzhou, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6221036/8747513/8386441/zhang-2841970-small.gif","p":["Zhijun Zhang (M\u201912) received the Ph.D. degree from Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China, in 2012.","He was a Post-Doctoral Research Fellow with the Institute for Media Innovation, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore from 2013 to 2015.

Identifiability is addressed both in principle and in practice. The approach begins by grouping parameters and partially nondimensionalising the SPM to determine the maximum expected degrees of freedom in the problem. We discover that excluding open-circuit voltage (OCV), there are only six independent parameters. We then examine the structural identifiability by considering whether the transfer function of the linearized SPM is unique. It is found that the model is unique provided that the electrode OCV functions have a known nonzero gradient, the parameters are ordered, and the electrode kinetics are lumped into a single charge-transfer resistance parameter. We then demonstrate the practical estimation of model parameters from measured frequency-domain experimental electrochemical impedance spectroscopy data, and show additionally that the parametrized model provides good predictive capabilities in the time domain, exhibiting a maximum voltage error of 20 mV between the model and the experiment over a 10-min dynamic discharge.","doi":"10.1109/TCST.2018.2838097","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Control Systems Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Control Systems Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/87/8789584/08386442.pdf","startPage":"1862","endPage":"1877","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCST.2018.2838097","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8789584","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Identifiability and Parameter Estimation of the Single Particle Lithium-Ion Battery Model","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8386442/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 June 2018","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2019","displayDocTitle":"Identifiability and Parameter Estimation of the Single Particle Lithium-Ion Battery Model","volume":"27","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2019","accessionNumber":"18884566","htmlLink":"/document/8386442/","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2019","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000266","fundingName":"Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council","grantNumber":"EP/K002252/1 and EP/N032888/1"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100004358","fundingName":"Samsung"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Identifiability and Parameter Estimation of the Single Particle Lithium-Ion Battery Model","sourcePdf":"tcst-bizeray-2838097-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.132017S","chronDate":"Sept.  2019","xplore-pub-id":"87","isNumber":"8789584","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"87","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"8789584","articleId":"8386442","onlineDate":"14 June 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-09"},{"_id":8386458,"authors":[{"name":"Yang Cui","affiliation":["School of Mathematics and Computer Science, Wuhan Polytechnic University, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Yang","lastName":"Cui","id":"37086399067"},{"name":"Zhang Xiaoqing","affiliation":["School of Mathematics and Computer Science, Wuhan Polytechnic University, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Zhang","lastName":"Xiaoqing","id":"37410785800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-4301-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-4302-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8386458","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":721},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8386458","abstract":"Tasks scheduling problem is the key challenge in cloud computing system. For reducing the execution cost of workflow tasks scheduling under the deadline and the budget constraint, a workflow tasks scheduling algorithm based on genetic algorithm in cloud computing is proposed. In our algorithm, each task is assigned priority by an top-down leveling method. By this top-down leveling method, all workflow tasks are divided into the different levels, which can promote the parallel execution of workflow tasks. When code the solution of tasks scheduling, we design a two dimension coding method. And, we design a new genetic crossover and mutation operation to produce new different off springs for increasing the population diversity. Through the fitness function synchronously considering the scheduling time and the scheduling cost, we can evaluate the individual fitness of population. Through the simulation experiments, we evaluate the performance of our algorithm based on realistic workflows model.

By introducing the object confirmation algorithm, the intelligent radar perimeter security system's false alarm rate can be reduced significantly. The object confirmation algorithm is essentially an object detection algorithm. Due to the poor generalization of artificial feature extraction algorithms, we use the deep convolution neural network to extract deep features automatically for object confirmation. In order to meet the real-time requirement in engineering practices, our algorithm use the YOLOv2 system as a basis, and selects anchor boxes which meet object scales of our training data set by k-means++ clustering. To improve the YOLOv2 network structure, low-layer deep features which denote the texture information and high-layer deep features which denote the semantic information are combined layer by layer to make object detection more accurate. The experimental results show that the false alarm rate of the intelligent radar perimeter security system is further reduced by introducing the object confirmation algorithm. Especially for extreme weather, false alarms of radar detection greatly increase. But most of them are eliminated after running object confirmation algorithm. Therefore the warning accuracy of the entire system can be guaranteed. The detection speed of the object confirmation algorithm is 33FPS, which meets the real-time requirement of engineering practices.","doi":"10.1109/ICCCBDA.2018.8386537","startPage":"331","endPage":"335","publicationTitle":"2018 IEEE 3rd International Conference on Cloud Computing and Big Data Analysis (ICCCBDA)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCCBDA.2018.8386537","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8386452","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 IEEE 3rd International Conference on Cloud Computing and Big Data Analysis (ICCCBDA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8373580/8386452/08386537.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Real-time object recognition algorithm based on deep convolutional neural network","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8386537/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Real-time object recognition algorithm based on deep convolutional neural network","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8386537/","accessionNumber":"17844188","publicationDate":"April 2018","dateOfInsertion":"18 June 2018","conferenceDate":"20-22 April 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-22 April 2018","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Real-time object recognition algorithm based on deep convolutional neural network","confLoc":"Chengdu, China","sourcePdf":"ICCCBDAChengdu2018065.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056517S","chronDate":"20-22 April 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8373580","isNumber":"8386452","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8373580","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"8386452","articleId":"8386537","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-12"},{"_id":8386546,"authors":[{"name":"Liang Liu","affiliation":["Shandong Normal University, Jinan, China"],"firstName":"Liang","lastName":"Liu","id":"37086397167"},{"name":"Budong Xu","affiliation":["Shandong Normal University, Jinan, China"],"firstName":"Budong","lastName":"Xu","id":"37086395453"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-4301-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-4302-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8386546","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":2007},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Peer-to-peer computing","Authentication","Distributed databases"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["authorisation","cryptography","data protection","Internet"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["blockchain data information","blockchain technology","information security technology change","modern Internet technology","distributed mechanism","decentralized mechanism","password mechanism","Internet information security technology","scripted mechanism","asymmetric cryptographic algorithm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["blockchain","distributed","timestamp","decentralized","information security"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8386546","abstract":"Information security is the key to the development of modern Internet technology.

However, the validation of cloud system simulations is not a well-investigated topic in the literature. It can be difficult to select the suitable tools of simulation to predict infrastructure performance due to the variety of existing cloud computing simulators and their varying levels of accuracy. This paper applies an approach to evaluate any cloud simulator through a comparative validation method against micro data centre infrastructure. We have extended earlier work in evaluating cloud computing simulators by applying the method we used to evaluate CloudSim on other tools. We present the level of accuracy for the GreenCloud simulator and Mininet platforms by applying the comparative validation method and sensitivity analysis for the results on actual and simulated performance. According to our findings, GreenCloud currently does not predict the energy consumption for a micro datacenter accurately. On the other hand, Mininet shows reasonable accuracy in modelling the network performance.","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 IEEE 3rd International Conference on Cloud Computing and Big Data Analysis (ICCCBDA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8373580/8386452/08386571.pdf","startPage":"522","endPage":"526","publicationTitle":"2018 IEEE 3rd International Conference on Cloud Computing and Big Data Analysis (ICCCBDA)","doi":"10.1109/ICCCBDA.2018.8386571","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCCBDA.2018.8386571","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8386452","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8386571","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance evaluation of cloud computing simulation tools","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Tools","Cloud computing","Computational modeling","Data models","Data centers","Servers","Benchmark testing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","computer centres","green computing","power aware computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["microdata centre infrastructure","GreenCloud simulator","comparative validation method","network performance","performance evaluation","data centre infrastructure","infrastructure performance","cloud computing simulators","CloudSim","Mininet platform","sensitivity analysis"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["CloudSim","Mininet","GreenCloud","simulation","performance evaluation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8386571/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-22 April 2018","displayDocTitle":"Performance evaluation of cloud computing simulation tools","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8386571/","publicationDate":"April 2018","accessionNumber":"17844166","dateOfInsertion":"18 June 2018","conferenceDate":"20-22 April 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance evaluation of cloud computing simulation tools","confLoc":"Chengdu, China","sourcePdf":"ICCCBDAChengdu2018099.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072207S","chronDate":"20-22 April 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8373580","isNumber":"8386452","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8373580","xplore-issue":"8386452","articleId":"8386571","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8386584,"authors":[{"name":"Bo Wang","affiliation":["State Grid, Electric Power Finance and Electronic Commerce Lab, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Bo","lastName":"Wang","id":"37086397916"},{"name":"Xingxiong Zhu","affiliation":["Beijing Huitong Financial Information Technology Co.

Based on the proposed objective weights and subjective weights, the fuzzy combination weights theory (FCW)-a new similar day selection theory is presented, which improves the accuracy of the similar day selection, and correspondingly, makes the original data for EMD processing decrease dramatically. BA is introduced to optimize parameters of the SVM model for further improving the forecasting accuracy. Using the decomposed load series via empirical model decomposition (EMD) as inputs to SVM and further correcting the output of SVM via KF, a hybrid FCW-EMD and KF-BA-SVM short-term load forecasting method is established.

optimal multiple-input multiple-output digital signal processing (MIMO-DSP) assignment to super-channels affected by intercore crosstalk (ICXT) in multicore fiber (MCF) enabled transparent optical core networks. MIMO-DSP undoes ICXT effects, but can be costly with high core density MCFs. Hence, its implementation in the network must be carefully decided. We address our objective as a joint route, modulation format, MIMO and spectrum assignment (RMMSA) problem, for which integer linear programming formulations are provided to optimally solve it in small network scenarios. Moreover, several heuristic approaches are also proposed to solve large-scale problem instances with good accuracy. Their goal is to minimize both network spectral requirements and the amount of MIMO equalized super-channels, taking a crosstalk-free space division multiplexing (SDM) solution as a reference, for example, based on parallel single mode fibers [i.e., a multifiber (MF) scenario]. For our evaluation, we consider several state-of-the-art MCF prototypes and different network topologies. The obtained results, with the considered MCFs, disclose that in national backbone networks, the desirable percentage of super-channels with MIMO equalization to match the performance of an equivalent crosstalk-free SDM solution ranges from 0% to 36, while in continental-wide networks this range raises from 0% to 56%. In addition, in the case of a nonideal MIMO (with a 3 dB/km of crosstalk compensation), such percentages range from 0% to 28% and from 0% to 45% in national and continental-wide backbone networks, respectively, experimenting a performance gap up to 12% with respect to the MF reference scenario.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Route, Modulation Format, MIMO, and Spectrum Assignment in Flex-Grid/MCF Transparent Optical Core Networks","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","doi":"10.1109/JLT.2018.2848199","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/50/8388764/08386639.pdf","startPage":"3534","endPage":"3546","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JLT.2018.2848199","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8388764","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8386639","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8386639/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 June 2018","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.15, 15 2018","displayDocTitle":"Route, Modulation Format, MIMO, and Spectrum Assignment in Flex-Grid/MCF Transparent Optical Core Networks","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"36","issue":"16","htmlLink":"/document/8386639/","dateOfInsertion":"29 June 2018","publicationDate":"15 Aug.15, 2018","accessionNumber":"17874267","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness","grantNumber":"TEC2017-90034-C2-1-R and TEC2017-90034-C2-2-R"},{"fundingName":"FEDER"},{"fundingName":"Secretar\u00eda Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnolog\u00eda (SENESCYT) \u2013 Ecuador","grantNumber":"2015-AR2Q9065"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Route, Modulation Format, MIMO, and Spectrum Assignment in Flex-Grid/MCF Transparent Optical Core Networks","sourcePdf":"jlt-rumipambazambrano-2848199-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.192748S","chronDate":"Aug.15, 15 2018","xplore-pub-id":"50","isNumber":"8388764","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"8388764","articleId":"8386639","onlineDate":"15 June 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8386650,"authors":[{"name":"Ilias Zenelis","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, McGill University, Montr\u00e9al, QC, Canada"],"firstName":"Ilias","lastName":"Zenelis","orcid":"0000-0002-8122-9039","id":"37086400331"},{"name":"Xiaozhe Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, McGill University, Montr\u00e9al, QC, Canada"],"firstName":"Xiaozhe","lastName":"Wang","orcid":"0000-0002-1887-0990","id":"37085422903"}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2475-1456"}],"articleNumber":"8386650","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":12,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1272},"abstract":"In this letter, a phasor measurement unit (PMU)-based wide-area damping control method is proposed to damp the interarea oscillations that threaten the modern power system stability and security.

Two-factor authentication (2FA) has been proposed to improve the security, where smart devices are used as the second authentication factor. However, the interaction between human and the smart device is required, which is inconvenient to users. In addition, an attacker is able to get the second authentication factor through fraud, thus invalidating current 2FA mechanisms. In order to solve these problems, we propose a transparent two-factor authentication (T2FA) based on physical unclonable function (PUF) and voiceprint. The second authentication authenticates the user's mobile phone through the PUF. The third one is to determine whether the login terminal and the user's mobile phone are in the same environment with the environment voiceprint. The second and third authentication in the second factor is completely transparent to users. Therefore, T2FA avoids the tedious interaction and provides the same high user experience satisfaction as the single-factor authentication and exhibits high security simultaneously. Moreover, the fraud is eliminated technically due to the transparency of the authentication.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/8274985/08386653.pdf","startPage":"32677","endPage":"32686","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2844548","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2844548","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8274985","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8386653","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"T2FA: Transparent Two-Factor Authentication","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Authentication","Mobile handsets","Password","Browsers","Software","Smart devices"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["authorisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["transparent two-factor authentication","password-based single-factor authentication","dictionary attacks","brute force attacks","authentication factor","T2FA mechanism","physical unclonable function"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Two-factor authentication","physical unclonable function (PUF)","voiceprint"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8386653/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2018","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 June 2018","displayDocTitle":"T2FA: Transparent Two-Factor Authentication","volume":"6","htmlLink":"/document/8386653/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"2018","accessionNumber":"17905561","dateOfInsertion":"06 July 2018","isOpenAccess":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61602107, 11726632 and 61604001"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004735","fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of\u00a0Hunan Province","grantNumber":"2018JJ3072"},{"fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"T2FA: Transparent Two-Factor Authentication","sourcePdf":"access-zhang-2844548-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.109547S","chronDate":"2018","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"8274985","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"8274985","articleId":"8386653","onlineDate":"15 June 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8386655,"authors":[{"name":"Xin Liu","affiliation":["School of Information and Communication Engineering, Dalian University of Technology, Dalian, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6488907/8784345/8386655/liu-2847731-small.gif","p":["Xin Liu (M\u201913) received the M.Sc. and Ph.D. degrees in communication engineering from the Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China, in 2008 and 2012, respectively.","He is currently an Associate Professor with the School of Information and Communication Engineering, Dalian University of Technology, Dalian, China.

Fifth generation (5G) network can flexibly support a variety of devices and services, which makes it possible to combine 5G with IoT. In this paper, a novel multichannel IoT is proposed to dynamically share the spectrum with 5G communication, where an IoT node including transmitter and receiver is designed to perform 5G communication and IoT communication simultaneously. The subchannel sets allocated for 5G communication and IoT communication are defined by two complementary spectrum marker vectors, respectively. Two independent spectrum sequences are generated by calculating the inner products of spectrum marker vectors, presudo-random phases and power scaling vectors. Two time-domain fundamental modulation waveforms generated by the inverse fast Fourier transform of the spectrum sequences are used to modulate 5G data and IoT data, respectively. The receiver can detect the data using the same spectrum marker vectors as the transmitter. The BER performances of the system using binary modulation and cyclic code shift keying modulation in the cases of spectrum marker error and multiple access are analyzed, respectively. A subchannel and power optimization unit is formulated as a joint optimization problem, which seeks to maximize the 5G throughput under the constraints of minimal IoT throughput, maximal power, and maximal interference. An alternative optimization problem is proposed to maximize the IoT throughput while guaranteeing the minimal 5G throughput. A joint optimization algorithm based on Lagrange dual decomposition is proposed to achieve the optimal solution. Simulation results indicate that the proposed IoT can improve the 5G throughput significantly while the IoT throughput is guaranteed.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8386655/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 June 2018","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2019","volume":"6","issue":"4","accessionNumber":"18869365","dateOfInsertion":"01 August 2019","publicationDate":"Aug. 2019","htmlLink":"/document/8386655/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A Novel Multichannel Internet of Things Based on Dynamic Spectrum Sharing in 5G Communication","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61601221, 51608092, 61671183 and 61771163"},{"fundingName":"China Post-Doctoral Science Foundations","grantNumber":"2015M580425 and 2018T110496"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Novel Multichannel Internet of Things Based on Dynamic Spectrum Sharing in 5G Communication","sourcePdf":"jiot-liu-2847731-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.072745S","chronDate":"Aug.  2019","xplore-pub-id":"6488907","isNumber":"8784345","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6488907","citationCount":"50","xplore-issue":"8784345","articleId":"8386655","onlineDate":"15 June 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8386657,"authors":[{"name":"F.

Based on the derived waveforms, we further consider weighted optimizations targeting a flexible tradeoff between radar and communications performance and introduce low-complexity algorithms. Moreover, to address the more practical constant modulus waveform design problem, we propose a branch-and-bound algorithm that obtains a globally optimal solution, and derive its worst-case complexity as function of the maximum iteration number.

In a recent work, we derived an approximate distribution of the LR-ANMF under the \u210c0 hypothesis by using a restrictive hypothesis (the target has to be orthogonal to the clutter subspace). In this paper, we propose to determine new approximations of the Pfa and the Pd of the LR-ANMF by relaxing this restrictive hypothesis. This new derivation is based on results concerning the convergence in a large dimension regime of quadratic forms. Simulations validate our result, in particular, when the tested signal is close to the clutter subspace.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2019","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8386662/","volume":"55","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/8386662/","publicationDate":"Feb. 2019","accessionNumber":"18470324","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"08 February 2019","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 June 2018","displayDocTitle":"Performance of the Low-Rank Adaptive Normalized Matched Filter Test Under a Large Dimension Regime","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"ONERA Agency"},{"fundingName":"SONDRA Lab"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance of the Low-Rank Adaptive Normalized Matched Filter Test Under a Large Dimension Regime","sourcePdf":"taes-ginolhac-2847911-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.08983S","chronDate":"Feb.  2019","xplore-pub-id":"7","isNumber":"8637087","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7","xplore-issue":"8637087","articleId":"8386662","onlineDate":"15 June 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8386664,"authors":[{"name":"Chao Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Electronics, Carleton University, Ottawa, ON, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/22/8425664/8386664/czhan-2841889-small.gif","p":["Chao Zhang (S\u201914) was born in Xinyang, Henan, China, in 1990.

In inverse modeling of a microwave component, the inputs to the model are electrical parameters such as S-parameters, and the outputs of the model are geometrical or physical parameters. Since the analytical formula of the inverse input-output relationship does not exist, the ANN becomes a logical choice, because it can be trained to learn from the data in inverse modeling. The main challenge of inverse modeling is the nonuniqueness problem. This problem in the ANN inverse modeling is that different training samples with the same or very similar input values have quite different (contradictory) output values (multivalued solutions). In this paper, we propose a multivalued neural network inverse modeling technique to associate a single set of electrical parameters with multiple sets of geometrical or physical parameters. One set of geometrical or physical parameters is called one value of our proposed inverse model. Our proposed multivalued neural network is structured to accommodate multiple values for the model output. We also propose a new training error function to focus on matching each training sample using only one value of our proposed inverse model, while other values are free and can be trained to match other contradictory samples. In this way, our proposed multivalued neural network can learn all the training data by automatically redirecting contradictory information into different values of the proposed inverse model. Therefore, our proposed technique can solve the nonuniqueness problem in a simpler and more automated way compared with the existing ANN inverse modeling techniques. This technique is illustrated by inverse modeling and parameter extraction of four microwave filter examples.","doi":"10.1109/TMTT.2018.2841889","pdfPath":"/iel7/22/8425664/08386664.pdf","startPage":"3781","endPage":"3797","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMTT.2018.2841889","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8425664","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multivalued Neural Network Inverse Modeling and Applications to Microwave Filters","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8386664/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2018","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 June 2018","displayDocTitle":"Multivalued Neural Network Inverse Modeling and Applications to Microwave Filters","volume":"66","issue":"8","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2018","accessionNumber":"17973634","publicationDate":"Aug. 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8386664/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000038","fundingName":"Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada","grantNumber":"RGPIN-2017-06420"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multivalued Neural Network Inverse Modeling and Applications to Microwave Filters","sourcePdf":"tmtt-zhang-2841889-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.185129S","chronDate":"Aug.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"22","isNumber":"8425664","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"33","xplore-issue":"8425664","articleId":"8386664","onlineDate":"15 June 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-12"},{"_id":8386666,"authors":[{"name":"Hela Jedda","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Technical University of Munich, Munich, Germany"],"firstName":"Hela","lastName":"Jedda","orcid":"0000-0001-7798-4587","id":"38232895400"},{"name":"Josef A.

In this paper, we show significant improvement upon such black box optimization by exploiting high-level knowledge of the parameter structure and using a local surrogate energy function. Our new framework, hierarchical sampling optimization (HSO), consists of a sequence of discriminative predictors organized into a kinematic hierarchy. Each predictor is conditioned on its ancestors, and generates a set of samples over a subset of the pose parameters, with only one selected by the highly-efficient surrogate energy. The selected partial poses are concatenated to generate a full-pose hypothesis. Repeating the same process, several hypotheses are generated and the full energy function selects the best result. Under the same kinematic hierarchy, two methods based on decision forest and convolutional neural network are proposed to generate the samples and two optimization methods are studied when optimizing these samples. Experimental evaluations on three publicly available datasets show that our method is particularly impressive in low-compute scenarios where it significantly outperforms all other state-of-the-art methods.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optimization","Kinematics","Pose estimation","Three-dimensional displays","Inverse problems","Forestry","Solid modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["convolutional neural nets","optimisation","pose estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hierarchical sampling optimization","inverse problem","pose parameters","black box optimization","high-level knowledge","parameter structure","local surrogate energy function","kinematic hierarchy","highly-efficient surrogate energy","selected partial poses","hand pose estimation","convolutional neural network","decision forest"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Hand pose estimation","kinematic hierarchy","sampling","random forest","convolutional neural network","particle swarm optimization"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TPAMI.2018.2847688","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel7/34/8787855/08386667.pdf","startPage":"2161","endPage":"2175","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8787855","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPAMI.2018.2847688","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Opening the Black Box: Hierarchical Sampling Optimization for Hand Pose Estimation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8386667","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Opening the Black Box: Hierarchical Sampling Optimization for Hand Pose Estimation","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8386667/","volume":"41","issue":"9","publicationDate":"1 Sept. 2019","htmlLink":"/document/8386667/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"18881898","pubMedId":"29994653","dateOfInsertion":"05 August 2019","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 1 2019","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 June 2018","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Opening the Black Box: Hierarchical Sampling Optimization for Hand Pose Estimation","sourcePdf":"tpami-ye-2847688-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.178685S","chronDate":"Sept. 1 2019","xplore-pub-id":"34","isNumber":"8787855","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"8787855","articleId":"8386667","onlineDate":"15 June 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":8386671,"authors":[{"name":"Bin Liao","affiliation":["Shenzhen University, Shenzhen, China"],"firstName":"Bin","lastName":"Liao","orcid":"0000-0003-4636-4339","id":"37085676037"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9251"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9603"},{"format":"CD","value":"2371-9877"}],"articleNumber":"8386671","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":27,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":668},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"Aerospace &amp; Electronic Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieee-aess.org/default.php"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Estimation","Covariance matrices","Direction-of-arrival estimation","MIMO radar","Correlation","Indexes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["covariance matrices","direction-of-arrival estimation","eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","MIMO radar"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["correlation matrix","MIMO radar","fast angle-estimation method","multiple-input-multiple-output radar","noise-covariance matrix","directions-of-arrival","DOA","covariance matrix","prewhitening algorithm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Direction-of-arrival (DOA)","eigendecomposition","multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) radar","nonorthogonal waveforms"]}],"abstract":"In this letter, a fast angle-estimation method for multiple-input-multiple-output radar with nonorthogonal waveforms is devised.

In addition, the proposed method offers promising DOA-estimation performance as verified by simulation results.","doi":"10.1109/TAES.2018.2847958","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/7/8428685/08386671.pdf","startPage":"2091","endPage":"2096","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8428685","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAES.2018.2847958","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fast Angle Estimation for MIMO Radar With Nonorthogonal Waveforms","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8386671","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2018","displayDocTitle":"Fast Angle Estimation for MIMO Radar With Nonorthogonal Waveforms","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8386671/","publicationDate":"Aug. 2018","dateOfInsertion":"07 August 2018","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"17991255","htmlLink":"/document/8386671/","volume":"54","issue":"4","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 June 2018","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61771316 and 61471365"},{"fundingName":"Foundation of Department of Education of Guangdong","grantNumber":"2016KTSCX125"},{"fundingName":"Foundation of Shenzhen","grantNumber":"JCYJ20170302150044331"},{"fundingName":"Foundation of Guangdong Science and Technology Department","grantNumber":"2017A030313341"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fast Angle Estimation for MIMO Radar With Nonorthogonal Waveforms","sourcePdf":"taes-liao-2847958-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.079385S","chronDate":"Aug.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"7","isNumber":"8428685","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7","citationCount":"27","xplore-issue":"8428685","articleId":"8386671","onlineDate":"15 June 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8386682,"authors":[{"name":"Peng Zhang","affiliation":["College of Engineering and Applied Sciences, Stony Brook University, New York, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6687317/8915964/8386682/zhang-2847629-small.gif","p":["Peng Zhang received the BS degree in mathematics from Nankai University, in 2003, the MS degree in parallel computing from the Nankai Institute of Scientific Computing, in 2006, and the PhD degree in applied mathematics from Stony Brook University, New York, USA, in 2012.

Being able to react quickly and intelligently to fast-changing markets is a decisive success factor for trading companies. To date, the rise of QF requires an integrated toolchain of enabling technologies to carry out complex event processing on the explosive growth and diversified forms of market metadata, in pursuit of a microsecond latency on an Exabyte-level dataset. Inspired by this, we present a data-driven execution paradigm that untangles the dependencies of complex processing events and integrate the paradigm with a big data infrastructure that streams time series data. This integrated platform is termed as the QuantCloud platform. Essentially, QuantCloud executes the complex event processing in a data-driven mode and manages large amounts of diversified market data in a data-parallel mode. To show its practicability and performance, we develop a prototype and benchmark by applying real-world QF research models on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) data. Using this prototype, we demonstrate this platform with an application to: (i) data cleaning and aggregating (including the computing of logarithmic returns from tick data and the finding the medians of grouped data) and (ii) data modeling: the autoregressive-moving average (ARMA) model. The performance results show that (a) this platform obtains a high throughput (usually in the order of millions of tick messages per second) and a sub-microsecond latency; (b) it fully executes data-dependent tasks through a data-driven execution; and (c) it implements a modular design approach for rapidly developing these data-crunching methods and QF research models. This platform resulting from an aggregated effort of the data-driven execution and big data infrastructure, offers the financial engineers with new insights and enhanced capabilities for effective and efficient incorporation of big data complex event processing technologies in their workflow.","doi":"10.1109/TBDATA.2018.2847629","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TBDATA.2018.2847629","startPage":"564","endPage":"575","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Big Data","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Big Data","pdfPath":"/iel7/6687317/8915964/08386682.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8915964","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"QuantCloud: Enabling Big Data Complex Event Processing for Quantitative Finance Through a Data-Driven Execution","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8386682/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec. 1 2019","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 June 2018","displayDocTitle":"QuantCloud: Enabling Big Data Complex Event Processing for Quantitative Finance Through a Data-Driven Execution","volume":"5","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"28 November 2019","accessionNumber":"19190378","publicationDate":"1 Dec. 2019","htmlLink":"/document/8386682/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100008982","fundingName":"National Science Foundation"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"QuantCloud: Enabling Big Data Complex Event Processing for Quantitative Finance Through a Data-Driven Execution","sourcePdf":"tbdata-zhang-2847629-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.183445S","chronDate":"Dec. 1 2019","xplore-pub-id":"6687317","isNumber":"8915964","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6687317","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"8915964","articleId":"8386682","onlineDate":"15 June 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8386686,"authors":[{"name":"Shu Sun","affiliation":["NYU WIRELESS Research Center, Tandon School of Engineering, New York University, Brooklyn, NY, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/8466982/8386686/sun-2848208-small.gif","p":["Shu Sun (S\u201913) received the B.S. degree in applied physics from\n Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China, in 2012, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from New York\n University Tandon School of Engineering, Brooklyn, NY, USA, in 2018, with a topic on fifth-generation millimeter-wave\n (mmWave) wireless communications under the supervision of Prof. T.

Radio propagation models are used to help engineers design, deploy, and compare candidate wireless technologies, and have a profound impact on the decisions of almost every aspect of wireless communications. This paper provides a comprehensive overview of the channel models that will likely be used in the design of 5G radio systems. We start with a discussion on the framework of channel models, which consists of classical models of path loss versus distance, large-scale, and small-scale fading models, and multiple-input multiple-output channel models. Then, key differences between mmWave and microwave channel models are presented, and two popular mmWave channel models are discussed: the 3rd Generation Partnership Project model, which is adopted by the International Telecommunication Union, and the NYUSIM model, which was developed from several years of field measurements in New York City. Examples on how to apply the channel models are then given for several diverse applications demonstrating the wide impact of the models and their parameter values, where the performance comparisons of the channel models are done with promising hybrid beamforming approaches, including leveraging coordinated multipoint transmission. These results show that the answers to channel performance metrics, such as spectrum efficiency, coverage, hardware/signal processing requirements, etc., are extremely sensitive to the choice of channel models.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2018.2848208","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/25/8466982/08386686.pdf","startPage":"8422","endPage":"8439","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8466982","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2018.2848208","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Propagation Models and Performance Evaluation for 5G Millimeter-Wave Bands","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8386686","chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/25/8466982/8386686-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2018","displayDocTitle":"Propagation Models and Performance Evaluation for 5G Millimeter-Wave Bands","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8386686/","isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2018","dateOfInsertion":"17 September 2018","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"18095061","htmlLink":"/document/8386686/","volume":"67","issue":"9","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 June 2018","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"NYU WIRELESS Industrial Affiliates"},{"fundingName":"NSF","grantNumber":"1320472, 1302336 and 1555332"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","chorusFlag":"true","title":"Propagation Models and Performance Evaluation for 5G Millimeter-Wave Bands","sourcePdf":"tvt-sun-2848208-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.146589S","chronDate":"Sept.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"8466982","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"68","xplore-issue":"8466982","articleId":"8386686","onlineDate":"15 June 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8386692,"authors":[{"name":"Feng Li","affiliation":["School of Automation, Nanjing University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6221021/9142459/8386692/li-2837888-small.gif","p":["Feng Li received the M.S. degree in electrical engineering from the School of Electrical and Information Engineering, Anhui University of Technology, Ma\u2019anshan, China, in 2017.

We optimize the user-centric weighted sum energy efficiency (WSEE), which is defined as the weighted sum of energy efficiencies of all the users, and is not a PC function. We propose a successive convex approximation approach to optimize it, and analytically show that this approach yields a Karush-Kuhn-Tucker point of the original WSEE problem. We also reduce the computational complexity of the above approach by approximating it as a second order cone program. We numerically demonstrate the WSEE improvement achieved by the proposed algorithms over baseline equal- and random-power allocation algorithms.","doi":"10.1109/LWC.2018.2847667","publicationTitle":"IEEE Wireless Communications Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Wireless Communications Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/5962382/8643663/08386693.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LWC.2018.2847667","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8643663","startPage":"25","endPage":"28","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Weighted Sum Energy Efficiency Optimization for Massive MIMO Two-Way Half-Duplex AF Relaying","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8386693","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Weighted Sum Energy Efficiency Optimization for Massive MIMO Two-Way Half-Duplex AF Relaying","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2019","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8386693/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 June 2018","isJournal":true,"volume":"8","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Feb. 2019","accessionNumber":"18470925","dateOfInsertion":"18 February 2019","htmlLink":"/document/8386693/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100008628","fundingName":"Ministry of Electronics and Information technology"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Weighted Sum Energy Efficiency Optimization for Massive MIMO Two-Way Half-Duplex AF Relaying","sourcePdf":"lwc-sharma-2847667-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.096677S","chronDate":"Feb.  2019","xplore-pub-id":"5962382","isNumber":"8643663","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5962382","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"8643663","articleId":"8386693","onlineDate":"15 June 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8386702,"authors":[{"name":"Muran Guo","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Temple University, Philadelphia, PA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/8390715/8386702/guo-2847645-small.gif","p":["Muran Guo (S\u201918) received the B.S. degree from Harbin\n Engineering University, Harbin, China, in 2014.

On the other hand, the compressive measurement method provides an effective way to reduce the number of frontend circuit chains. In this paper, we generalized current works on the two categories of methods to a compressed sparse array (CSA) scheme, which combines the compressive measurement method, and the sparse array together to significantly reduce the system complexity. After introducing the proposed scheme, the Cram\u00e9r-Rao bound (CRB) of the proposed CSA scheme is derived. We then determine the corresponding existing conditions of the CRB, based on which the number of DOFs is derived and examined for the first time. It is proved that, for a CSA which compressed the output of an L-element sparse array to M <; L chains, a higher number of DOFs is obtained as compared to that of the M-element array with the same sparse structure. Furthermore, the DOA estimation accuracy using the M-chain CSA is higher than that using the M-element sparse array due to the extended array aperture. Numerical simulations verify the superiority of the proposed CSA scheme.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/78/8390715/08386702.pdf","startPage":"4133","endPage":"4146","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2018.2847645","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2018.2847645","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8390715","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8386702","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"DOA Estimation Using Compressed Sparse Array","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Estimation","Direction-of-arrival estimation","Antenna arrays","Array signal processing","Receiving antennas","Sparse matrices","Complexity theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","computational complexity","direction-of-arrival estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["M-element array","sparse structure","DOA estimation accuracy","M-chain CSA","M-element sparse array","extended array aperture","CSA scheme","nested arrays","coprime arrays","reduced number","compressive measurement method","frontend circuit chains","compressed sparse array scheme","Cram\u00e9r-Rao bound","L-element sparse array","higher number","DOF","direction-of-arrival estimation","degrees-of-freedom","numerical simulations","system complexity reduction"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Compressive sensing","Cram\u00e9r-Rao bound","DOA estimation","information theory","sparse array"]}],"chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/78/8390715/8386702-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8386702/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.1, 1 2018","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 June 2018","displayDocTitle":"DOA Estimation Using Compressed Sparse Array","volume":"66","issue":"15","htmlLink":"/document/8386702/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"1 Aug.1, 2018","accessionNumber":"17874278","dateOfInsertion":"28 June 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"China Scholarship Council for his stay at the Temple University"},{"fundingName":"National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"AST-1547420"},{"fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61571146"},{"fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities","grantNumber":"HEUCFP201769"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","chorusFlag":"true","title":"DOA Estimation Using Compressed Sparse Array","sourcePdf":"tsp-chen-2847645-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.083878S","chronDate":"Aug.1, 1 2018","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"8390715","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"30","xplore-issue":"8390715","articleId":"8386702","onlineDate":"15 June 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8386705,"authors":[{"name":"Kateryna Stoyka","affiliation":["Department of Information and Electrical Engineering and Applied Mathematics, University of Salerno, Fisciano, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/8636215/8386705/stoyk-2848109-small.gif","p":["Kateryna Stoyka was born in Khust, Ukraine, in 1989.

This paper discusses a new behavioral model for reliable prediction of ac power loss in FPIs, including the effects of saturation. The new model has been identified by means of the Genetic Programming (GP) algorithm combined with a Multi-Objective Optimization (MOO) technique, starting from large sets of power loss experimental measurements. The proposed ac power loss model uses as input variables the voltage and switching frequency imposed to the inductor by the SMPS operation, while the dc inductor current is used as a parameter expressing the impact of saturation. Such quantities can be easily determined for whatever converter topology and in real-world switching operation, thus confirming the readiness and the easiness-to-use of the proposed behavioral model. The results of experimental tests presented in this paper prove the reliability of the power loss predictions, also by correctly accounting for the impact of inductors saturation.","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2018.2848109","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/63/8636215/08386705.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2018.2848109","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8636215","startPage":"2680","endPage":"2692","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Novel AC Power Loss Model for Ferrite Power Inductors","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8386705","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A Novel AC Power Loss Model for Ferrite Power Inductors","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2019","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8386705/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 June 2018","isJournal":true,"volume":"34","issue":"3","publicationDate":"March 2019","accessionNumber":"18467268","dateOfInsertion":"06 February 2019","htmlLink":"/document/8386705/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100007065","fundingName":"Universit\u00e0 degli Studi di Salerno","grantNumber":"300638FRB16FEMIA"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Novel AC Power Loss Model for Ferrite Power Inductors","sourcePdf":"tpel-stoyka-2848109-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.109835S","chronDate":"March  2019","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"8636215","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"8636215","articleId":"8386705","onlineDate":"15 June 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-28"},{"_id":8386707,"authors":[{"name":"Amir Aminjavaheri","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/8390715/8386707/aminj-2846263-small.gif","p":["Amir Aminjavaheri received the B.Sc. degree in electrical engineering\n fromthe Isfahan University of Technology, Isfahan, Iran, in 2013, and the M.Sc. degree in electrical and computer\n engineering from University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT, USA, in 2016.

We show that the effects of channel distortions, i.e., intersymbol interference and intercarrier interference, do not vanish as the base station (BS) array size increases. As a result, the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) cannot grow unboundedly by increasing the number of BS antennas, and is upper bounded by a certain deterministic value. We show that this phenomenon is a result of the correlation between the multiantenna combining tap values and the channel impulse responses between the mobile terminals and the BS antennas. To resolve this problem, we introduce an efficient equalization method that removes this correlation, enabling us to achieve arbitrarily large SINR values by increasing the number of BS antennas. We perform a thorough analysis of the proposed system and find analytical expressions for both equalizer coefficients and the respective SINR.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/78/8390715/08386707.pdf","startPage":"3987","endPage":"4000","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2018.2846263","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2018.2846263","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8390715","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8386707","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Filter Bank Multicarrier in Massive MIMO: Analysis and Channel Equalization","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interference","MIMO communication","Signal to noise ratio","Time-frequency analysis","Distortion","Prototypes","Receivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel bank filters","equalisers","intercarrier interference","interference suppression","intersymbol interference","MIMO communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["filter bank multicarrier","massive MIMO","channel equalization","channel distortions","intersymbol interference","intercarrier interference","signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio","SINR","BS antennas","tap values","channel impulse responses","base station array size","massive multiinput multioutput system"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Massive MIMO","FBMC/OQAM","OFDM","SINR","channel equalization","asymptotic analysis"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8386707/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.1, 1 2018","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 June 2018","displayDocTitle":"Filter Bank Multicarrier in Massive MIMO: Analysis and Channel Equalization","volume":"66","issue":"15","htmlLink":"/document/8386707/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"1 Aug.1, 2018","accessionNumber":"17857716","dateOfInsertion":"22 June 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001602","fundingName":"Science Foundation Ireland"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100008530","fundingName":"European Regional Development Fund","grantNumber":"13/RC/2077"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Filter Bank Multicarrier in Massive MIMO: Analysis and Channel Equalization","sourcePdf":"tsp-aminjavaheri-2846263-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.09456S","chronDate":"Aug.1, 1 2018","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"8390715","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"8390715","articleId":"8386707","onlineDate":"15 June 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8386743,"authors":[{"name":"Wenjie Yu","affiliation":["School of Mechatronics Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/8274985/8386743/yu-2847732-small.gif","p":["Wenjie Yu received the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in mechanical engineering from the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China in 2013 and 2017, respectively.

The optimum structure design of contact pairs is important for a backplane connector in meeting multiple challenges in terms of minimizing the maximum insertion force and the contact resistance. Current optimization schemes, such as the quadrature method, are relatively complex. Therefore, we designed the connector contact pairs for simultaneously obtaining the proper insertion force and the contact resistance through a multi-objective particle swarm optimization (MCDPSO) method with simpler settings and faster convergence speed. In this paper, the required insertion force was minimized during the entire process, and the minimum contact resistance was maintained after insertion. To this end, an MCDPSO algorithm was proposed for the connector design. A dynamic weight coefficient was developed to calculate the interval values of the reserved solutions for the selection of the operator, and an external archive update based on roulette wheel selection and gbest selection strategies was developed to increase the diversity of the solutions. A set of optimal structure solutions of the contact pairs was obtained for the subsequent design optimization. The feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method were verified by comparing with the results from ANSYS finite element simulation.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8386743/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 June 2018","chronOrPublicationDate":"2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","publicationDate":"2018","accessionNumber":"17925334","htmlLink":"/document/8386743/","isJournal":true,"isOpenAccess":true,"dateOfInsertion":"10 July 2018","volume":"6","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Multi-Objective Optimum Design of High-Speed Backplane Connector Using Particle Swarm Optimization","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004829","fundingName":"Department of Science and Technology of Sichuan Province","grantNumber":"2018GZ0284"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"51205047"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Multi-Objective Optimum Design of High-Speed Backplane Connector Using Particle Swarm Optimization","sourcePdf":"access-yu-2847732-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.108334S","chronDate":"2018","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"8274985","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"8274985","articleId":"8386743","onlineDate":"15 June 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8386744,"authors":[{"name":"Tuan Nguyen Gia","affiliation":["Department of Future Technologies, University of Turku, Turku, Finland"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/8274985/8386744/gia-2848119-small.gif","p":["Tuan Nguyen Gia received the master\u2019s (Tech.) degree from the University of Turku, Turku, Finland, in 2014.

The handover mechanism serves to keep the connection between sensor nodes and a gateway with a low latency. The handover mechanism also attentively considers oscillating nodes which often occur in many streaming IoT systems. By leveraging the strategic position of smart gateways and Fog computing in a real-time streaming IoT system, sensor nodes' loads were alleviated whereas advanced services, like push notification and local data storage, were provided. The paper discussed and analyzed metrics for the handover mechanism based on Wi-Fi. In addition, a complete remote real-time health monitoring IoT system was implemented for experiments. The results from evaluating our mobility handover mechanism for mobility support shows that the latency of switching from one gateway to another is 10%-50% less than other state-of-the-art mobility support systems. The results show that the proposed handover mechanism is a very promising approach for mobility support in both Fog computing and IoT systems.","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2848119","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/8274985/08386744.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2848119","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8274985","startPage":"36064","endPage":"36082","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fog Computing Approach for Mobility Support in Internet-of-Things Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8386744","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Fog Computing Approach for Mobility Support in Internet-of-Things Systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8386744/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 June 2018","isJournal":true,"isOpenAccess":true,"volume":"6","publicationDate":"2018","accessionNumber":"17925340","dateOfInsertion":"16 July 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8386744/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002341","fundingName":"Academy of Finland"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004181","fundingName":"Nokia Foundation"},{"fundingName":"University of Turku Graduate School"},{"fundingName":"Finnish Foundation for Technology Promotion"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Fog Computing Approach for Mobility Support in Internet-of-Things Systems","sourcePdf":"access-nguyengia-2848119-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.104224S","chronDate":"2018","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"8274985","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"8274985","articleId":"8386744","onlineDate":"15 June 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8386749,"authors":[{"name":"Lijing Zhou","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Networking and Switching Technology, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/8274985/8386749/zhou-2847632-small.gif","p":["Lijing Zhou received the B.Sc. degree in mathematics and applied mathematics from Inner Mongolia Normal University, China, in 2009, and the M.S. degree in cryptography from Xidian University, China, in 2013.

Generally, IoT is a centralized system whose security and performance mainly rely on centralized servers. Therefore, users have to trust the centralized servers; in addition, it is difficult to coordinate external computing resources to improve the performance of IoT. Fortunately, the blockchain may provide this decentralization, high credibility and high security. Consequently, blockchain-based IoT may become a reasonable choice for the design of a decentralized IoT system. In this paper, we propose a novel blockchain-based threshold IoT service system: BeeKeeper. In the BeeKeeper system, servers can process a user's data by performing homomorphic computations on the data without learning anything from them. Furthermore, any node can become a leader's server if the node and the leader desire so. In this way, BeeKeeper's performance can continually increase by attracting external computing resources to join in it. Moreover, malicious nodes can be scrutinized. In addition, BeeKeeper is fault tolerant since a user's BeeKeeper protocol may work smoothly as long as a threshold number of its servers are active and honest. Finally, we deploy BeeKeeper on the Ethereum blockchain and give the corresponding performance evaluation. In our experiments, servers can generate their response with about 107 ms. Moreover, the performance of BeeKeeper mainly depends on the blockchain platform. For instance, the response time is about 22.5 s since the block interval of Ethereum blockchain is about 15 s. In fact, if we use some other blockchain with short block interval, the response time may be obviously short.","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2847632","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/8274985/08386749.pdf","startPage":"43472","endPage":"43488","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2847632","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8274985","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"BeeKeeper: A Blockchain-Based IoT System With Secure Storage and Homomorphic Computation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 June 2018","displayDocTitle":"BeeKeeper: A Blockchain-Based IoT System With Secure Storage and Homomorphic Computation","volume":"6","dateOfInsertion":"28 August 2018","accessionNumber":"18068888","isJournal":true,"isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"2018","htmlLink":"/document/8386749/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8386749/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"2018","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"National Key Research and Development Program","grantNumber":"2016YFB0800602"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61502048"},{"fundingName":"Shandong provincial Key Research and Development Program of China","grantNumber":"2018CXGC0701 and 2018GGX106005"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"BeeKeeper: A Blockchain-Based IoT System With Secure Storage and Homomorphic Computation","sourcePdf":"access-zhou-2847632-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.100004S","chronDate":"2018","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"8274985","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"39","xplore-issue":"8274985","articleId":"8386749","onlineDate":"15 June 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8386750,"authors":[{"name":"Peiying Zhang","affiliation":["College of Computer and Communication Engineering, China University of Petroleum (East China), Qingdao, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/8274985/8386750/zhang-2847910-small.gif","p":["Peiying Zhang is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree in information and communication engineering from the State Key Laboratory of Networking and Switching Technology, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications.

One of the key challenges in network virtualization is the resource allocation problem, which is also termed the virtual network embedding (VNE) problem. It involved with mapping virtual networks onto a substrate network by adhering to some constraints, such as CPU capacity, on the nodes and bandwidth resources on the links. However, prior heuristic VNE algorithms mostly concentrate on measuring the embedding potential of substrate nodes using the multiplication of different nodes' resource metrics. Due to the fact that different resource metrics have different impacts on node ranking, these traditional methods have some limitations that would cause unbalanced embedding problems. Furthermore, the number of hops for the substrate paths that virtual links are mapped onto will have a large impact on the resource utilization of substrate links in a substrate network. In this paper, based on the topology analysis of six situations, we first propose a novel five-node ranking metric to quantify the importance of substrate nodes. Then, we give a comprehensive measurement method for substrate nodes using the simplified ELECTRE method to avoid an unbalanced embedding solution. We present a novel two-stage VNE algorithm, which chooses the substrate nodes with the maximum embedding potential to perform the node mapping procedure, and uses the shortest path algorithm to accomplish the link mapping procedure. Extensive simulation results demonstrated that our proposed method behaves better than the other state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of the long-term average revenue, the revenue-to-cost (R/C) ratio, and the VN request acceptance ratio.","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2847910","startPage":"37314","endPage":"37327","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/8274985/08386750.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2847910","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8274985","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Virtual Network Embedding Using Node Multiple Metrics Based on Simplified ELECTRE Method","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Substrates","Measurement","Heuristic algorithms","Indium phosphide","III-V semiconductor materials","Network topology","Topology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Internet","resource allocation","virtualisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["VNE problem","Internet","shortest path algorithm","five-node ranking metric","resource metrics","heuristic VNE algorithms","maximum embedding potential","substrate links","resource utilization","virtual links","substrate paths","unbalanced embedding problems","substrate nodes","bandwidth resources","substrate network","resource allocation problem","network virtualization","simplified ELECTRE method","node multiple metrics","virtual network embedding","link mapping procedure","node mapping procedure"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["virtual network embedding","node mapping procedure","link mapping procedure","node ranking metric"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8386750/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 June 2018","chronOrPublicationDate":"2018","displayDocTitle":"Virtual Network Embedding Using Node Multiple Metrics Based on Simplified ELECTRE Method","volume":"6","htmlLink":"/document/8386750/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"2018","dateOfInsertion":"23 July 2018","isOpenAccess":true,"accessionNumber":"17928119","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities of the China University of Petroleum (East China)","grantNumber":"18CX02139A"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100007129","fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of Shandong Province","grantNumber":"ZR2014FQ018"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61471056"},{"fundingName":"National Basic Research Program (973) of China","grantNumber":"2012CB315801"},{"fundingName":"China Research Project on Key Technology Strategy of Infrastructure Security for Information Network Development"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Virtual Network Embedding Using Node Multiple Metrics Based on Simplified ELECTRE Method","sourcePdf":"access-zhang-2847910-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.100167S","chronDate":"2018","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"8274985","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"8274985","articleId":"8386750","onlineDate":"15 June 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-12-12"},{"_id":8386751,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaojun Zhou","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Engineering, Central South University, Changsha, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/8274985/8386751/xzhou-2847641-small.gif","p":["Xiaojun Zhou received the bachelor\u2019s degree in automation from Central South University, Changsha, China, in 2009, and the Ph.D. degree in applied mathematics from Federation University Australia in 2014.","He is currently an Associate Professor with Central South University.

The goal of the goethite process is to make the outlet ion concentration satisfy the technical requirements with minimal process consumption. To simplify the difficulties of optimization in the goethite process, an optimization method based on a setpoint tracking strategy is proposed. The set-point tracking strategy is used to transform the complex state constraints into an additional objective. Therefore, the single optimization control problem for the goethite process is transformed into a bi-objective optimization control problem. Furthermore, PID controllers are adopted to control the addition amounts of zinc oxide and oxygen in the goethite process. The optimal parameters of the PID controllers are obtained via a multi-objective state transition algorithm (MOSTA). The performance of MOSTA is verified by several benchmark test functions with performance matrices. The control performance reveals that the proposed method is an effective way to control the process and can not only reduce the zinc oxide and oxygen addition amounts compared with manual operation and traditional PID control but also reject disturbances. The proposed method can satisfy the industrial requirements with less energy consumption.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8386751/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 June 2018","isJournal":true,"isOpenAccess":true,"accessionNumber":"17948502","volume":"6","htmlLink":"/document/8386751/","publicationDate":"2018","dateOfInsertion":"23 July 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Set-Point Tracking and Multi-Objective Optimization-Based PID Control for the Goethite Process","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61503416, 61533021 and 61725306"},{"fundingName":"111 Project","grantNumber":"B17048"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002822","fundingName":"Central South University","grantNumber":"2018CX012"},{"fundingName":"Foundation for Innovative Research Groups of the National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61621062"},{"fundingName":"Hunan Provincial Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"2018JJ3683"},{"fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities of Central South University","grantNumber":"2017zzts492"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Set-Point Tracking and Multi-Objective Optimization-Based PID Control for the Goethite Process","sourcePdf":"access-zhou-2847641-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.124411S","chronDate":"2018","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"8274985","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"8274985","articleId":"8386751","onlineDate":"15 June 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-12-02"},{"_id":8386753,"authors":[{"name":"Xiang Zhao","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Cognitive Radio and Information Processing, Guilin University of Electronic Technology, Guilin, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/8274985/8386753/zhao-2847744-small.gif","p":["Xiang Zhao received the B.Eng. degree in information engineering and the M.Sc. degree in communication and information systems from the Guilin University of Electronic Technology, Guilin, China, in 2001 and 2006, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree in communication and information systems from Xidian University, Xi\u2019an, China, in 2017.

When the light-emitting diode (LED) transmitter communicates with multiple legitimate users by downlink NOMA, both single eavesdropper and multi-eavesdropper scenarios are considered. In the presence of single eavesdropper, based on transmission characteristics of the optical wireless channel, with known instantaneous channel state information (CSI) of the NOMA legitimate channels and statistical CSI of the eavesdropper channel, an exact expression of secrecy outage probability (SOP) is derived, which acts as a benchmark of the security performance to guide selecting or optimizing parameters of the LED transmitter and the photodiode receiver of NOMA legitimate users. In the multi-eavesdropper case, based on the spatial distribution of legitimate users and eavesdroppers, the SOP is obtained via a stochastic geometry theory, so as to guide the NOMA legitimate users to keep away from the area with high eavesdropper density. For typical parameters of the indoor LED transmitter and the PD receiver, simulation results show that the SOP performance improves with the increasing of LED transmission power or transmission signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in both scenarios. Specifically, in the single eavesdropper case, enlarging the channel condition difference of user groups or deviating the eavesdropper from the given user group can improve the SOP performance, and for a given NOMA legitimate user, the SOP eventually settles around 0.2 while the semiangle at half illuminance of the LED varies between 15\u00b0 to 60\u00b0. In the multi-eavesdropper case, we can get a better SOP performance when reducing the eavesdropper density or the semi-angle at half illuminance of the LED for a given eavesdropper density.","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2847744","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2847744","startPage":"34004","endPage":"34017","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/8274985/08386753.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8274985","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On Physical-Layer Security in Multiuser Visible Light Communication Systems With Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8386753/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2018","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 June 2018","displayDocTitle":"On Physical-Layer Security in Multiuser Visible Light Communication Systems With Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access","volume":"6","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"10 July 2018","accessionNumber":"17905784","isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"2018","htmlLink":"/document/8386753/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61671165 and 61471135"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004607","fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of Guangxi Province","grantNumber":"2016GXNSFGA389009 and 2017GXNSFAA198283"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100005372","fundingName":"Guilin University of Electronic Technology"},{"fundingName":"Guangxi Key Laboratory of Wireless Wideband Communication and Signal Processing","grantNumber":"CRKL160105 and CRKL170101"},{"fundingName":"Guangxi Key Laboratory of Cryptography and Information Security","grantNumber":"GCIS201702"},{"fundingName":"Guangxi Key Laboratory of Trusted Software","grantNumber":"KX201723"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"On Physical-Layer Security in Multiuser Visible Light Communication Systems With Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access","sourcePdf":"access-chen-2847744-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.177569S","chronDate":"2018","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"8274985","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"8274985","articleId":"8386753","onlineDate":"15 June 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8386756,"authors":[{"name":"Tao Gao","affiliation":["College of Information and Control Engineering, China University of Petroleum, Qingdao, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/8274985/8386756/gao-2848117-small.gif","p":["Tao Gao received the B.S. degree in control science and engineering from Qufu Normal University, Rizhao, China, in 2016.

Compared with the existing gradient-based training algorithm, this scheme efficiently enhances the learning performance. Two deterministic convergence results are proved in detail, which indicate that the gradient of the objective function approaches zero (weak convergence) and the sequence of system parameters tends to a fixed point (strong convergence), respectively.

The advantages of D2D communication can be fully realized in multi-hop communication scenario. The integration of cellular and multi-hop networks not only provides guaranteed quality of service and reliability as a traditional cellular network, but also has the flexibility and adaptability as a multi-hop network. Routing in such multi-hop cellular D2D networks is a critical issue, since the multi-hop network can perform worse than a traditional cellular network if wrong routing decisions are made. This is because routing in these multi-hop networks needs to take care of the node mobility, dynamic network topology, and network fragmentation, which did not exist in traditional cellular networking.

It has become an active research issue of great concern in recent years. However, most algorithms of the existing studies are powerless for large-scale and high-dimensional data, and the intermediate data extracted by some methods that can handle high-dimensional data will consume lots of storage space. In this paper, we propose a novel sparse representation framework that learns dictionaries based on the latent space of variational auto-encoder. For large-scale data sets, it can play the role of dimensionality reduction to obtain hidden information, and extract more high-level features than hand-crafted features. At the same time, for the storage of normal information, the space cost can be greatly reduced. To verify the versatility and performance of the proposed learning algorithm, we have experimented on different types of anomaly detection tasks, including KDD-CUP data set for network intrusion detection, Mnist data set for image anomaly detection, and UCSD pedestrian's data set for abnormal event detection in surveillance videos. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms competing algorithms in all kinds of anomaly detection tasks.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE

Well-known anomaly detection algorithms often suffer from challenges posed by network data, such as high dimension and sparsity, and a lack of anomaly data for training, model selection, and hyperparameter tuning. Our approach is to introduce new regularizers to a classical autoencoder (AE) and a variational AE, which force normal data into a very tight area centered at the origin in the nonsaturating area of the bottleneck unit activations. These trained AEs on normal data will push normal points toward the origin, whereas anomalies, which differ from normal data, will be put far away from the normal region. The models are very different from common regularized AEs, sparse AE, and contractive AE, in which the regularized AEs tend to make their latent representation less sensitive to changes of the input data. The bottleneck feature space is now used as a new data representation. A number of one-class learning algorithms are used for evaluating the proposed models. The experiments testify that our models help these classifiers to perform efficiently and consistently on high-dimensional and sparse network datasets, even with relatively few training points. More importantly, the models can minimize the effect of model selection on these classifiers since their performance is insensitive to a wide range of hyperparameter settings.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics","pdfPath":"/iel7/6221036/8708695/08386786.pdf","startPage":"3074","endPage":"3087","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics","doi":"10.1109/TCYB.2018.2838668","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCYB.2018.2838668","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8708695","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8386786","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Learning Neural Representations for Network Anomaly Detection","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Anomaly detection","Data models","Distributed databases","Computational modeling","Task analysis","Neural networks","Training"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data structures","learning (artificial intelligence)","neural nets","security of data"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hyperparameter tuning","high-dimensional network datasets","sparse network datasets","one-class learning algorithms","data representation","input data","common regularized AEs","normal region","normal points","trained AEs","bottleneck unit activations","normal data","model selection","anomaly data","sparsity","network data","latent representation models","network anomaly detection","neural representations"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Anomaly detection","autoencoders (AEs)","high dimension","latent representation","one-class classification (OCC)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8386786/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2019","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 June 2018","displayDocTitle":"Learning Neural Representations for Network Anomaly Detection","volume":"49","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/8386786/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2019","accessionNumber":"18690517","pubMedId":"29994493","dateOfInsertion":"07 May 2019","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Vietnam International Education Development"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001631","fundingName":"University College Dublin"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Learning Neural Representations for Network Anomaly Detection","sourcePdf":"tcyb-cao-2838668-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.124377S","chronDate":"Aug.  2019","xplore-pub-id":"6221036","isNumber":"8708695","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6221036","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"8708695","articleId":"8386786","onlineDate":"15 June 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8386789,"authors":[{"name":"He Zhu","affiliation":["Global Big Data Technology Center, School of Electrical and Data Engineering, University of Technology Sydney, Ultimo, NSW, Australia"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8919/8511082/8386789/hzhu-2839701-small.gif","p":["He Zhu received the B.Sc. and M.Eng. degrees from the South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, China, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from the School of ITEE, The University of Queensland, Brisbane, Australia.

This approach utilizes a combination of a broadside-coupling technique and a split-ring structure. To fully understand the principle behind it, simplified LC equivalent-circuit models are provided. By analyzing these models, guidelines for implementation of an ultra-compact resonator and a BPF are given. To further demonstrate the feasibility of using this approach in practice, both the implemented resonator and the filter are fabricated in a standard 0.13-\u03bcm (Bi)-CMOS technology. The measured results show that the resonator can generate a resonance at 66.75 GHz, while the BPF has a center frequency at 40 GHz and an insertion loss of 1.7 dB. The chip size of both the resonator and the BPF, excluding the pads, is only 0.012mm\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n (0.08 \u00d7 0.144 mm\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n).","doi":"10.1109/TCSI.2018.2839701","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSI.2018.2839701","startPage":"4062","endPage":"4071","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","pdfPath":"/iel7/8919/8511082/08386789.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8511082","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Miniaturized Resonator and Bandpass Filter for Silicon-Based Monolithic Microwave and Millimeter-Wave Integrated Circuits","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8386789/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2018","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 June 2018","displayDocTitle":"Miniaturized Resonator and Bandpass Filter for Silicon-Based Monolithic Microwave and Millimeter-Wave Integrated Circuits","volume":"65","issue":"12","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"26 October 2018","accessionNumber":"18194552","publicationDate":"Dec. 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8386789/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000923","fundingName":"Australian Research Council","grantNumber":"DE160101032"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Miniaturized Resonator and Bandpass Filter for Silicon-Based Monolithic Microwave and Millimeter-Wave Integrated Circuits","sourcePdf":"tcsi-zhu-2839701-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.123123S","chronDate":"Dec.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"8511082","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"24","xplore-issue":"8511082","articleId":"8386789","onlineDate":"15 June 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8386796,"authors":[{"name":"Mahdi Parvizi","affiliation":["Ciena Corporation, Ottawa, ON, Canada"],"firstName":"Mahdi","lastName":"Parvizi","orcid":"0000-0003-4848-9469","id":"37680894800"},{"name":"Sadok Aouini","affiliation":["Ciena Corporation, Ottawa, ON, Canada"],"firstName":"Sadok","lastName":"Aouini","id":"37540508300"},{"name":"Mohammad S.

In order to enable the usage of on-chip inductor for low load current 10-40 mA, the proposed buck regulator is designed with an ultra-high switching frequency at 2 GHz, which is the highest switching frequency reported so far. To reduce the power switch losses, resonant switching scheme is utilized to save the switching clock energy. Tunable slew rate recovery circuits are used to improve the efficiency of the design.

Van et al. reformulate the problem as designing a corresponding placement delivery array and propose two new schemes from this perspective. These schemes significantly reduce the rate compared with the uncoded caching schemes. However, to implement these schemes, each file should be cut into F pieces, where F grows exponentially with the number of users K. Such a constraint is obviously infeasible in the practical setting, especially when K is large. Thus, it is desirable to design caching schemes with constant rate R (independent of K) as well as smaller F. In this paper, we view the centralized coded caching problem in a hypergraph perspective and show that designing a feasible placement delivery array is equivalent to constructing a linear and (6,3)-free 3-uniform 3-partite hypergraph. Several new results and constructions arise from our novel point of view. First, by using the famous (6,3)-theorem in extremal graph theory, we show that constant rate placement delivery arrays with F growing linearly with K do not exist. Second, we present two infinite classes of placement delivery arrays to show that constant rate caching schemes with F growing sub-exponentially with K do exist.","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2018.2847679","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2018.2847679","startPage":"5755","endPage":"5766","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel7/18/8410392/08386806.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8410392","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Centralized Coded Caching Schemes: A Hypergraph Theoretical Approach","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8386806/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2018","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 June 2018","displayDocTitle":"Centralized Coded Caching Schemes: A Hypergraph Theoretical Approach","volume":"64","issue":"8","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"12 July 2018","accessionNumber":"17932538","publicationDate":"Aug. 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8386806/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002858","fundingName":"China Postdoctoral Science Foundation","grantNumber":"2017M610942"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100005024","fundingName":"Beijing Postdoctoral Research Foundation"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"11431003 and 61571310"},{"fundingName":"Beijing Scholars Program"},{"fundingName":"Beijing Hundreds of Leading Talents Training Project of Science and Technology"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004826","fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of Beijing Municipality"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Centralized Coded Caching Schemes: A Hypergraph Theoretical Approach","sourcePdf":"tit-ge-2847679-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.138911S","chronDate":"Aug.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"8410392","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"40","xplore-issue":"8410392","articleId":"8386806","onlineDate":"15 June 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8386809,"authors":[{"name":"Yalu Li","affiliation":["School of Mathematics and Statistics, Shandong Normal University, Jinan, China"],"firstName":"Yalu","lastName":"Li","orcid":"0000-0003-2886-8736","id":"37086831772"},{"name":"Haitao Li","affiliation":["School of Mathematics and Statistics, Shandong Normal University, Jinan, China"],"firstName":"Haitao","lastName":"Li","orcid":"0000-0001-5322-5375","id":"38522236700"},{"name":"Xueying Ding","affiliation":["School of Mathematics and Statistics, Shandong Normal University, Jinan, China"],"firstName":"Xueying","lastName":"Ding","id":"37086282227"},{"name":"Guodong Zhao","affiliation":["School of Mathematics and Statistics, Shandong Normal University, Jinan, China"],"firstName":"Guodong","lastName":"Zhao","id":"37085453576"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2168-2267"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2168-2275"}],"articleNumber":"8386809","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":15,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":774},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Delay effects","Multi-agent systems","Switches","Topology","Network topology","Matrix converters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["algebra","delays","multi-agent systems","topology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["switching topology case","multiagent systems","finite-field leader-follower consensus","equivalent algebraic form","finite fields","time delays"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Finite field","leader\u2013follower consensus","multiagent system","semi-tensor product (STP) of matrices","switching topology","time delay"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8386809","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics","pdfPath":"/iel7/6221036/8708695/08386809.pdf","startPage":"3203","endPage":"3208","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCYB.2018.2839892","doi":"10.1109/TCYB.2018.2839892","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8708695","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Leader\u2013Follower Consensus of Multiagent Systems With Time Delays Over Finite Fields","abstract":"This paper studies the leader-follower consensus of multiagent systems with time delays and switching topology over finite fields.

By utilizing the coupling current reuse technique, the coupling current of one core is shared as a source to bias the quadrature coupling device in the other core. Thus, the coupling current consumption is eliminated. Moreover, the injected tank current is reshaped to reduce noise injection and increase efficiency. The coupling current reuse technique allows the proposed QVCO to achieve at least 50% power consumption decreasing compared to previous LC-QVCOs without sacrifices of phase noise and swing. In addition, the quadrature coupling topology is reused as an oscillation detector for dynamic bias control to further decrease power consumption of oscillation cores.

In this letter, we address this issue by developing a two-tier non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) scheme together with efficient power control to enable aggressive frequency reuse and alleviate co-channel interference. For the considered multi-tier and multi-cell NOMA scenario, we formulate a power minimization problem, and develop an efficient algorithm with guaranteed convergence to enable optimal power control, such that users' data demand is satisfied and backhauling bottleneck is avoided. Numerical results show the fast convergence of the proposed algorithm, and demonstrate that NOMA is in particular favorable for the high-demand cases in power savings.","doi":"10.1109/LCOMM.2018.2847672","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/4234/8432073/08386827.pdf","startPage":"1696","endPage":"1699","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8432073","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LCOMM.2018.2847672","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"NOMA Aided Interference Management for Full-Duplex Self-Backhauling HetNets","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8386827","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2018","displayDocTitle":"NOMA Aided Interference Management for Full-Duplex Self-Backhauling HetNets","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8386827/","publicationDate":"Aug. 2018","dateOfInsertion":"10 August 2018","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"18007271","htmlLink":"/document/8386827/","volume":"22","issue":"8","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 June 2018","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001866","fundingName":"Fonds National de la Recherche Luxembourg","grantNumber":"C17/IS/11632107"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"NOMA Aided Interference Management for Full-Duplex Self-Backhauling HetNets","sourcePdf":"lcomm-lei-2847672-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.042036S","chronDate":"Aug.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"4234","isNumber":"8432073","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4234","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"8432073","articleId":"8386827","onlineDate":"15 June 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Letter","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8386828,"authors":[{"name":"Tao Wang","affiliation":["School of Physics and Electronic Information Engineering, Qinghai Nationalities University, Xining, China"],"firstName":"Tao","lastName":"Wang","orcid":"0000-0002-5152-271X","id":"37086452357"},{"name":"Yonghong Hou","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Information Engineering, Tianjin University, Tianjin, China"],"firstName":"Yonghong","lastName":"Hou","orcid":"0000-0002-1676-5505","id":"37653361900"},{"name":"Maode Ma","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"firstName":"Maode","lastName":"Ma","orcid":"0000-0003-1438-7018","id":"37280212000"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-7798"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2558"},{"format":"CD","value":"2373-7891"}],"articleNumber":"8386828","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":303},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Time-domain analysis","Complexity theory","Optical receivers","Optical modulation","Bit error rate"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["error statistics","fast Fourier transforms","OFDM modulation","optical modulation","optical receivers","pulse amplitude modulation","time-domain analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["HACO-OFDM","pulse-amplitude-modulated discrete multitone branch","time-domain signals","time-domain processing","asymmetrically clipped optical OFDM","ACO-OFDM branch","PAM-DMT branch","time-domain clipping noise estimation","hybrid asymmetrically clipped optical orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","fast Fourier transform","bit error rate","BER performance"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Optical wireless communications","ACO-OFDM","PAM-DMT","hybrid ACO-OFDM"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8386828","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/4234/8458055/08386828.pdf","startPage":"1862","endPage":"1865","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LCOMM.2018.2847650","doi":"10.1109/LCOMM.2018.2847650","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8458055","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Novel Receiver Design for HACO-OFDM by Time-Domain Clipping Noise Elimination","abstract":"The conventional receiver of hybrid asymmetrically clipped optical orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (HACO-OFDM) requires additional processing to regenerate and cancel the clipping noise, which increases the complexity of the receiver and makes the performance of pulse-amplitude-modulated discrete multitone (PAM-DMT) branch dependent on the accuracy of clipping noise estimation. In this work, a novel receiver of HACO-OFDM is proposed by fully exploiting the structure of time-domain signals. Through a time-domain processing, the clipping noise of the asymmetrically clipped optical OFDM (ACO-OFDM) can be removed and error propagation is avoided. Compared with the conventional receiver, the proposed receiver can achieve 58.3% complexity reduction in the case of a fast Fourier transform with size of 512. Simulation results show that the bit error rate (BER) of the proposed receiver is exactly the same as that of the conventional receiver for the ACO-OFDM branch, but when the clipping noise estimation in ACO-OFDM branch is inaccurate, the BER performance of the PAM-DMT branch is significantly improved over the conventional receiver.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8386828/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 June 2018","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2018","volume":"22","issue":"9","accessionNumber":"18093975","dateOfInsertion":"10 September 2018","publicationDate":"Sept. 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8386828/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A Novel Receiver Design for HACO-OFDM by Time-Domain Clipping Noise Elimination","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61571325"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100010041","fundingName":"Tianjin Science and Technology Committee","grantNumber":"16ZXHLGX00190"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Novel Receiver Design for HACO-OFDM by Time-Domain Clipping Noise Elimination","sourcePdf":"lcomm-ma-2847650-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.067677S","chronDate":"Sept.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"4234","isNumber":"8458055","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4234","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"8458055","articleId":"8386828","onlineDate":"15 June 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Letter","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8386829,"authors":[{"name":"Md Murad Hossain","affiliation":["North Carolina State University, Raleigh, NC, USA"],"firstName":"Md Murad","lastName":"Hossain","orcid":"0000-0002-7228-9996","id":"37085859533"},{"name":"Benjamin E.

The induced motion is on the nanometer scale, which makes its detection and its isolation from background motion challenging. Previously, a frequency and phase locking (FPL) algorithm was used to suppress background motion by subtracting magnetic field off (B-off) from on (B-on) data. Shortcomings to this approach include long tracking ensembles and the requirement for B-off data. In this paper, a novel blind source separation-based FPL (BSS-FPL) algorithm is presented for detecting motion using a shorter ensemble length (EL) than FPL and without B-off data. MMUS imaging of two phantoms containing an SPIO-laden cubical inclusion and one control phantom was performed using an openair MMUS system. When background subtraction was used, contrast and contrast to noise ratio (CNR) were, respectively, 1.20\u00b10.20 and 1.56\u00b10.34 times higher in BSS-FPL as compared to FPL-derived images for EL <; 3.5 s. However, contrast and CNR were similar for BSS-FPL and FPL for EL \u2265 3.5 s. When only B-on data was used, contrast and CNR were 1.94 \u00b1 0.21 and 1.56 \u00b1 0.28 times higher, respectively, in BSS-FPL as compared to FPL-derived images for all ELs. Percent error in the estimated width and height was 39.30% \u00b1 19.98% and 110.37% \u00b1 6.5% for FPL and was 7.30% \u00b1 7.6% and 16.21% \u00b1 10.29% for BSS-FPL algorithm. This paper is an important step toward translating MMUS imaging to in vivo application, where long tracking ensembles would increase acquisition time and B-off data may be misaligned with B-on due to physiological motion.","doi":"10.1109/TMI.2018.2848204","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical

Traditional views of blur such as the reduction in energy at high frequencies and loss of phase coherence at localized features have fundamental limitations. For example, they cannot well discriminate flat regions from blurred ones. Here, we propose that the high-level semantic information is critical in successfully identifying the local blur. Therefore, we resort to deep neural networks that are proficient at learning high-level features and propose the first end-to-end local blur mapping algorithm based on a fully convolutional network. By analyzing various architectures with different depths and design philosophies, we empirically show that the high-level features of deeper layers play a more important role than the low-level features of shallower layers in resolving challenging ambiguities for this task. We test the proposed method on a standard blur detection benchmark and demonstrate that it significantly advances the state-of-the-art (ODS F-score of 0.853). Furthermore, we explore the use of the generated blur maps in three applications, including the blur region segmentation, blur degree estimation, and blur magnification.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8386849/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 June 2018","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"18912221","pubMedId":"29994659","volume":"27","issue":"10","htmlLink":"/document/8386849/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2018","dateOfInsertion":"27 July 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Deep Blur Mapping: Exploiting High-Level Semantics by Deep Neural Networks","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000038","fundingName":"Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000923","fundingName":"Australian Research Council","grantNumber":"FL-170100117, DP-180103424 and LP-150100671"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Deep Blur Mapping: Exploiting High-Level Semantics by Deep Neural Networks","sourcePdf":"tip-ma-2847421-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.136837S","chronDate":"Oct.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"83","isNumber":"8396881","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"8396881","articleId":"8386849","onlineDate":"15 June 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8386851,"authors":[{"name":"Lun Li","affiliation":["School of Mechanical Engineering and Electronic Information, China University of Geosciences (Wuhan), Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Lun","lastName":"Li","orcid":"0000-0002-2229-5191","id":"37086404296"},{"name":"Tianye Huang","affiliation":["School of Mechanical Engineering and Electronic Information, China University of Geosciences (Wuhan), Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Tianye","lastName":"Huang","orcid":"0000-0001-9754-9873","id":"37086079510"},{"name":"Xiang Zhao","affiliation":["School of Mechanical Engineering and Electronic Information, China University of Geosciences (Wuhan), Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Xiang","lastName":"Zhao","id":"37086404852"},{"name":"Xu Wu","affiliation":["School of Mechanical Engineering and Electronic Information, China University of Geosciences (Wuhan), Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Xu","lastName":"Wu","id":"37086404883"},{"name":"Zhuo Cheng","affiliation":["School of Mechanical Engineering and Electronic Information, China University of Geosciences (Wuhan), Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Zhuo","lastName":"Cheng","id":"37086405034"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1041-1135"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0174"}],"articleNumber":"8386851","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":574},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Photonics Society","url":"http://www.PhotonicsSociety.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sensitivity","Refractive index","Sensors","Couplings","Dielectrics","Metals","Plasmons"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optical planar waveguides","optical sensors","polaritons","refractive index","refractive index measurement","surface plasmon resonance","whispering gallery modes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hybrid coupling","dielectric planar waveguide mode","ultrasensitive refractive index sensing","multilayer Otto configuration","phase matching condition","hybrid modes","intensity sensitivity","highly sensitive SPR sensor","photonic mode","surface plasmon resonance sensor","long-range surface plasmon polariton","photonic WGM","structure parameters","targeting refractive index ranges","dielectric medium"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Surface plasmon resonance","Otto configuration","spectrum splitting","hybrid structure"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8386851","abstract":"In this letter, we propose a new configuration of surface plasmon resonance sensor based on hybrid coupling between long-range surface plasmon polariton (LRSPP) and dielectric planar waveguide mode (WGM) for ultrasensitive refractive index sensing. The multilayer Otto configuration supports both LRSPP and photonic WGM. Under phase matching condition, these two modes can be dramatically coupled with each other forming hybrid modes and consequently splitting the resonance. By optimizing the structure parameters, an intensity sensitivity as high as 3081/RIU is achieved, which corresponds to 1.2-fold enhancement comparing to the conventional LRSPP sensor.

In particular, we propose a smart contract-based framework, which consists of multiple access control contracts (ACCs), one judge contract (JC), and one register contract (RC), to achieve distributed and trustworthy access control for IoT systems. Each ACC provides one access control method for a subject-object pair, and implements both static access right validation based on predefined policies and dynamic access right validation by checking the behavior of the subject. The JC implements a misbehavior-judging method to facilitate the dynamic validation of the ACCs by receiving misbehavior reports from the ACCs, judging the misbehavior and returning the corresponding penalty. The RC registers the information of the access control and misbehavior-judging methods as well as their smart contracts, and also provides functions (e.g., register, update, and delete) to manage these methods. To demonstrate the application of the framework, we provide a case study in an IoT system with one desktop computer, one laptop and two Raspberry Pi single-board computers, where the ACCs, JC, and RC are implemented based on the Ethereum smart contract platform to achieve the access control.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8386853/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 June 2018","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2019","volume":"6","issue":"2","accessionNumber":"18653977","dateOfInsertion":"08 May 2019","publicationDate":"April 2019","htmlLink":"/document/8386853/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Smart Contract-Based Access Control for the Internet of Things","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100012166","fundingName":"National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program)","grantNumber":"2017YFB1400700"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001691","fundingName":"Japan Society for the Promotion of Science","grantNumber":"15H04008"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"U1536202, 61571352 and 61502255"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Smart Contract-Based Access Control for the Internet of Things","sourcePdf":"jiot-zhang-2847705-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.106418S","chronDate":"April  2019","xplore-pub-id":"6488907","isNumber":"8709863","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6488907","citationCount":"104","xplore-issue":"8709863","articleId":"8386853","onlineDate":"15 June 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8386855,"authors":[{"name":"Younghyun Lim","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology, Ulsan, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4/8449338/8386855/lim-2841984-small.gif","p":["Younghyun Lim (S\u201914) was born in Gyeongju, South Korea, in 1992.

The LDO is designed to have the dominant pole at the gate of the pass transistor to secure stability without the use of an external capacitor, even when the load current increases significantly. Using the proposed adaptive supply-ripple cancellation (ASRC) technique, in which the ripples copied from the supply are injected adaptively to the body gate, the PSR hump that appears in conventional gate-poledominant LDOs can be suppressed significantly.

To this end, we propose to use non-parametric message importance measure (NMIM) as a measure of message importance, which can characterize the uncertainty of random events like Shannon entropy and R\u00e9nyi entropy. We prove that NMIM sufficiently describes the two key characters of big data, i.e., the rare events finding and the large diversities of events. Based on NMIM, we then propose an effective compressed encoding mode for data storage, and discuss the transmission of messages over some typical channel models with limited message importance loss. Our numerical results show that the proposed strategy occupies less storage space without losing too much important information, and the maximum received entropy rate increases with the increasing of message importance loss until it reaches saturation, which contributes to designing of better practical communication system.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2018.2847666","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/8536744/08386858.pdf","startPage":"5181","endPage":"5196","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8536744","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2018.2847666","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Non-Parametric Message Importance Measure: Storage Code Design and Transmission Planning for Big Data","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8386858","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2018","displayDocTitle":"Non-Parametric Message Importance Measure: Storage Code Design and Transmission Planning for Big Data","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8386858/","publicationDate":"Nov. 2018","dateOfInsertion":"15 November 2018","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"18248009","htmlLink":"/document/8386858/","volume":"66","issue":"11","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 June 2018","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61771283"},{"fundingName":"China Major State Basic Research Development Program (973 Program)","grantNumber":"2012CB316100(2)"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Non-Parametric Message Importance Measure: Storage Code Design and Transmission Planning for Big Data","sourcePdf":"tcomm-fan-2847666-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.117554S","chronDate":"Nov.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"8536744","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"8536744","articleId":"8386858","onlineDate":"15 June 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8386866,"authors":[{"name":"Tom Coughlin","affiliation":["Coughlin Associates"],"bio":{"p":["Tom Coughlin (tom@tomcoughlin.com) is the founder of Coughlin Associates.

By deploying more small cells in a fixed area, the average distance between users and access points can be significantly reduced; hence, dense spatial frequency reuse can be exploited. However, severe interference is the major obstacle in UDNs. Most contributions deal with the interference by relying on cooperative game theory. This article advocates the application of dense user-centric C-RAN philosophy to UDNs, thanks to the recent development of cloud computing techniques. Under dense C-RAN, centralized signal processing can be invoked for supporting CoMP transmission. We summarize the main challenges in dense user-centric C-RANs. One of the most challenging issues is the requirement of the global CSI for the sake of cooperative transmission. We investigate this requirement by only relying on partial CSI, namely, on inter-cluster large-scale CSI. Furthermore, the estimation of the intra-cluster CSI is considered, including the pilot allocation and robust transmission. Finally, we highlight several promising research directions to make the dense user-centric C-RAN become a reality, with special emphasis on the application of big data techniques.","doi":"10.1109/MCOM.2018.1700483","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8387185","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MCOM.2018.1700483","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Magazine","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel7/35/8387185/08387197.pdf","startPage":"14","endPage":"20","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"User-Centric C-RAN Architecture for Ultra-Dense 5G Networks: Challenges and Methodologies","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 June 2018","displayDocTitle":"User-Centric C-RAN Architecture for Ultra-Dense 5G Networks: Challenges and Methodologies","volume":"56","issue":"6","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2018","dateOfInsertion":"18 June 2018","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8387197/","publicationDate":"June 2018","accessionNumber":"17840126","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8387197/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"User-Centric C-RAN Architecture for Ultra-Dense 5G Networks: Challenges and Methodologies","sourcePdf":"010HANZO_LAYOUT.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.081622S","chronDate":"June  2018","xplore-pub-id":"35","isNumber":"8387185","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"35","citationCount":"57","xplore-issue":"8387185","articleId":"8387197","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8387198,"authors":[{"name":"Xiao Lu","affiliation":["University of Alberta"],"bio":{"p":["Xiao Lu is now pursing a Ph.D degree at the University of Alberta, Canada.

Nowadays, users rely heavily on HWNs for ubiquitous network access to support critical applications such as financial transactions, e-health, and public safety. Cyber risks, representing one of the most significant threats to network security and reliability, are increasing in severity. To address this problem, this article introduces the concept of cyber insurance to transfer the cyber risks in HWNs to a third-party insurer. First, a review of the enabling technologies for HWNs and their vulnerabilities to cyber risks is presented. Then the fundamentals of cyber insurance are introduced, and subsequently, a cyber insurance framework for HWNs is presented. Finally, open issues are discussed and the challenges are highlighted for integrating cyber insurance as a service of next generation HWNs.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel7/35/8387185/08387198.pdf","startPage":"21","endPage":"27","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Magazine","doi":"10.1109/MCOM.2018.1700504","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MCOM.2018.1700504","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8387185","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8387198","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cyber Insurance for Heterogeneous Wireless Networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Ultra-dense networks","Wireless communication","Communication system security","MIMO communication","5G mobile commuincation","Cyberattack","Heterogeneous networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Internet","radio networks","security of data","telecommunication security","ubiquitous computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["heterogeneous wireless networks","radio access technologies","ubiquitous network access","cyber risks","third-party insurer","cyber insurance framework","base stations"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8387198/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2018","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 June 2018","displayDocTitle":"Cyber Insurance for Heterogeneous Wireless Networks","volume":"56","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/8387198/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"June 2018","accessionNumber":"17840130","dateOfInsertion":"18 June 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cyber Insurance for Heterogeneous Wireless Networks","sourcePdf":"011LU_LAYOUT.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.059391S","chronDate":"June  2018","xplore-pub-id":"35","isNumber":"8387185","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"35","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"8387185","articleId":"8387198","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8387199,"authors":[{"name":"Haichao Wang","affiliation":["Army Engineering University"],"bio":{"p":["Haichao Wang (whcwl0919@sina.com) received his B.S. degree in electronic engineering from the College of Communications Engineering, Nanjing, China, in 2014.

The proposed SupBS architecture consists of two layers, namely, an infrastructure layer and a virtualized network layer. In the infrastructure layer, there are three key physical components: the hybrid heterogeneous radio unit pool, line interface switch unit, and computing resources pool. In the virtualized network layer, there are two logical modules designed on top of the three physical components, namely, the virtualized base station and virtualized software defined core network. The two logical modules are designed to facilitate the use of the underlying three physical components by reducing the energy consumption and processing delay.

With abundant access points, each with communication, computation, and storage resources, the UDN brings unprecedented benefits, including significant improvement in network spectral efficiency and energy efficiency, greatly reduced latency to enable novel mobile applications, and the capability of providing massive access for Internet of Things devices. However, such great promise comes with formidable research challenges. To design and operate such complex networks with various types of resources, efficient and innovative methodologies will be needed.

However, counter to the 5G vision, ultra-dense deployment of networks would significantly increase energy consumption and thus decrease network energy efficiency, suffering from the conventional worst case network design philosophy. This problem becomes particularly severe when Ud-HetNets meet big data because of the traditional reactive request-transmit service mode. In view of these, this article first develops a big-data-aware artificial- intelligence-based framework for energy-efficient operations of Ud-HetNets. Based on the framework, we then identify four promising techniques, namely big data analysis, adaptive base station operation, proactive caching, and interference- aware resource allocation, to reduce energy cost on both large and small scales. We further develop a load-aware stochastic optimization approach to show the potential of our proposed framework and techniques in energy conservation. In a nutshell, we devote our work to constructing green Ud-HetNets of big data with the abilities of learning and inferring by improving the flexibility of control from worst case to adaptive design and shifting the manner of services from reactive to proactive modes.","doi":"10.1109/MCOM.2018.1700425","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Magazine","startPage":"56","endPage":"63","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MCOM.2018.1700425","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8387185","pdfPath":"/iel7/35/8387185/08387203.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Magazine","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Big Data","Energy efficiency","Social network services","Learning systems","Green products","Energy conservation","Wireless communication","5G mobile communication","Heterogeneous networks","Ultra-dense networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["5G mobile communication","Big Data","cellular radio","energy conservation","energy consumption","next generation networks","optimisation","resource allocation","stochastic processes","telecommunication computing","telecommunication power management","telecommunication traffic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["load-aware stochastic optimization approach","energy conservation","green Ud-HetNets","meet big data","green frameworks","ultra-dense heterogeneous networks","network capacity","next-generation wireless networks","energy consumption","network energy efficiency","big-data-aware artificial- intelligence","energy-efficient operations","big data analysis","adaptive base station operation","interference- aware resource allocation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Ultra-Dense HetNets Meet Big Data: Green Frameworks, Techniques, and Approaches","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8387203/","volume":"56","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/8387203/","accessionNumber":"17840135","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"18 June 2018","publicationDate":"June 2018","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 June 2018","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2018","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Ultra-Dense HetNets Meet Big Data: Green Frameworks, Techniques, and Approaches","sourcePdf":"016JIANG_LAYOUT.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.064229S","chronDate":"June  2018","xplore-pub-id":"35","isNumber":"8387185","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"35","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"8387185","articleId":"8387203","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8387204,"authors":[{"name":"Zhenyu Zhou","affiliation":["North China Electric Power University"],"bio":{"p":["Zhenyu Zhou [M'11, SM'17] (zhenyu_zhou@ncepu.edu.cn) received his M.E. and Ph.D. degrees from Waseda University, Tokyo, Japan, in 2008 and 2011, respectively.

This new measure is of particular interest to ultra-dense deployment of the emerging 5G wireless networks in the unlicensed spectrum, leveraging the capacity gain brought by the use of the unlicensed band and the stringent reliability sustained by 5G in future heterogeneous network environments.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Preserving Reliability of Heterogeneous Ultra-Dense Distributed Networks in Unlicensed Spectrum","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Magazine","doi":"10.1109/MCOM.2018.1700474","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel7/35/8387185/08387205.pdf","startPage":"72","endPage":"78","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MCOM.2018.1700474","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8387185","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8387205","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8387205/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 June 2018","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2018","displayDocTitle":"Preserving Reliability of Heterogeneous Ultra-Dense Distributed Networks in Unlicensed Spectrum","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"56","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/8387205/","dateOfInsertion":"18 June 2018","publicationDate":"June 2018","accessionNumber":"17840134","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Preserving Reliability of Heterogeneous Ultra-Dense Distributed Networks in Unlicensed Spectrum","sourcePdf":"018CUI_LAYOUT.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.069849S","chronDate":"June  2018","xplore-pub-id":"35","isNumber":"8387185","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"35","citationCount":"29","xplore-issue":"8387185","articleId":"8387205","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8387206,"authors":[{"name":"Guanding Yu","affiliation":["Zhejiang University"],"bio":{"p":["Guanding Yu [S'05, M'07, SM'13] (yuguanding@zju.edu.cn) is an associate professor with the College of Information and Electronic Engineering at Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China.

Meanwhile, the enormous amount of available spectrum in millimeter-wave (mmWave) bands can be also exploited to increase the wireless link capacity. In accordance with these trends, this article introduces a novel hierarchical software-defined networking (SDN) architecture to facilitate the deployment of UDNs with both microwave base stations and mmWave access points. Aimed at reducing the cost of computational complexity and signaling overhead, the novel SDN architecture employs a semi-distributed design approach by configuring two levels of controllers: the centralized superior SDN controller and the localized subordinate SDN controller. Some practical challenges posed by the characteristics of mmWave transmissions, such as high propagation loss, channel blockage, and directional beamforming, are also discussed. To deal with such challenges, we then propose several important network operations for the hierarchical SDN, including dynamic subordinate SDN management, mobility management, and user-centric design. We finally provide simulation results to demonstrate the performance advantages of our proposals.","doi":"10.1109/MCOM.2018.1700490","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Magazine","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel7/35/8387185/08387206.pdf","startPage":"79","endPage":"85","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MCOM.2018.1700490","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8387185","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Hierarchical SDN Architecture for Ultra-Dense Millimeter-Wave Cellular Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8387206","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 June 2018","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8387206/","displayDocTitle":"A Hierarchical SDN Architecture for Ultra-Dense Millimeter-Wave Cellular Networks","volume":"56","issue":"6","publicationDate":"June 2018","accessionNumber":"17840127","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8387206/","dateOfInsertion":"18 June 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Hierarchical SDN Architecture for Ultra-Dense Millimeter-Wave Cellular Networks","sourcePdf":"019TANG_LAYOUT.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.038784S","chronDate":"June  2018","xplore-pub-id":"35","isNumber":"8387185","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"35","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"8387185","articleId":"8387206","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-09"},{"_id":8387207,"authors":[{"name":"Zhijin Qin","affiliation":["Lancaster University"],"bio":{"p":["Zhijin Qin (zhijin.qin@lancaster.ac.uk) received her Ph.D. degree from Queen Mary University of London in 2016.

Also, it is generally accepted that there are three major ways to obtain several orders of increase in throughput gain, those being extreme densification of infrastructure, large quantities of new bandwidth, and a large number of antennas, allowing a throughput gain in the spatial dimension. These processes are complementary in many respects. Among others, in the search for more bandwidth beyond microwave and millimeter-wave (mmWave) systems, we are moving toward higher frequencies, especially in the promising terahertz (THz) frequency range.

We envision a radically different communication paradigm and outline a MAC protocol design that switches among the aforementioned bands for data transmissions, falling back on the slower link each time for the reverse channel ACKs. The use of the higher-capacity link in the forward direction for data communication and the slower reverse channel for the returning ACKs allows for uninterrupted unidirectional communication and efficient use of the channel. The article discusses the challenges in analyzing and parameter setting for the various features of the protocol, and identifies candidate solutions. A performance evaluation of the approach is undertaken using a realistic scenario of vehicle-to-infrastructure communication enabling data center traffic backhauling. This performance shows that by adopting the proposed MAC protocol data transfer of around 100 Terabits, it is possible for typical vehicle-to-infrastructure contact times.","doi":"10.1109/MCOM.2018.1700924","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MCOM.2018.1700924","startPage":"110","endPage":"115","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Magazine","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel7/35/8387185/08387213.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8387185","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Beyond 5G: THz-Based Medium Access Protocol for Mobile Heterogeneous Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8387213/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2018","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 June 2018","displayDocTitle":"Beyond 5G: THz-Based Medium Access Protocol for Mobile Heterogeneous Networks","volume":"56","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"18 June 2018","accessionNumber":"17840117","publicationDate":"June 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8387213/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Beyond 5G: THz-Based Medium Access Protocol for Mobile Heterogeneous Networks","sourcePdf":"026CACCIAPUOTI_LAYOUT.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.147502S","chronDate":"June  2018","xplore-pub-id":"35","isNumber":"8387185","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"35","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"8387185","articleId":"8387213","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8387214,"authors":[{"name":"Zan Li","affiliation":["Xidian University"],"bio":{"p":["Zan Li [M'06, SM'14] (zanli@xidian.edu.cn) received her B.S. degree in communications engineering and her M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in communication and information systems from Xidian University, Xian, China, in 1998, 2000, and 2004, respectively.

However, the security of THz MHNs is rarely discussed and urgently needs attention. For the purpose of effectively resolving the exposed security issues in THz MHNs, in this article, an intelligent spectrum control strategy in a THz network is proposed, and an intelligent spectrum control sequence is generated, which has the characteristics of adaptive frequency slot number, wide gap, and orthogonality. Extensive theoretical analyses prove that this sequence outperforms the sequences available in uniformity, randomness, and Hamming correlation. Simulation results indicate that the proposed strategy has great anti-attack capability and high throughput, and that the BER of THz communication with the proposed strategy can be increased two orders of magnitude in a complex electromagnetic environment.

To support the explosively growing mobile data volumes, wireless communications with millimeter- wave (mmWave) radios have attracted massive attention, and is widely considered as a promising candidate in 5G HetNets. In this article, we give an overview on the end-to-end latency of HetNets with mmWave communications. In general, it is rather challenging to formulate and optimize the delay problem with buffers in mmWave communications, since conventional graph-based network optimization techniques are not applicable when queues are considered. Toward this end, we develop an adaptive low-latency strategy, which uses cooperative networking to reduce the end-to-end latency. Then we evaluate the performance of the introduced strategy. Results reveal the importance of proper cooperative networking in reducing the end-toend latency. In addition, we have identified several challenges in future research for low-latency mmWave HetNets.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MCOM.2018.1700874","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8387185","startPage":"124","endPage":"129","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel7/35/8387185/08387215.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Low-Latency Heterogeneous Networks with Millimeter-Wave Communications","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8387215/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2018","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 June 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8387215/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Low-Latency Heterogeneous Networks with Millimeter-Wave Communications","publicationDate":"June 2018","accessionNumber":"17840133","dateOfInsertion":"18 June 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"56","issue":"6","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low-Latency Heterogeneous Networks with Millimeter-Wave Communications","sourcePdf":"028YANG_LAYOUT.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.047397S","chronDate":"June  2018","xplore-pub-id":"35","isNumber":"8387185","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"35","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"8387185","articleId":"8387215","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8387216,"authors":[{"name":"Ho-Jin Song","affiliation":["Pohang University of Science and Technology"],"bio":{"p":["Ho-Jin Song received his Ph.

The goal is to support the explosive demands for mobile broadband services foreseen for the next decade. In this work, we investigate the joint impact of the three technologies. Using system-level simulations, we evaluate the performance of two-tier cellular networks with \u03bc Wave macrocells and densely deployed mmWave small cells. Our results show that much higher capacity can be realized with UDNs than in macrocell-only setups. The results also reveal that performance does not scale proportionally with increase in the employed mmWave bandwidth. The corresponding increase in noise (due to larger bandwidths) reduces the SINR. Outdoor users experience promising data rates notwithstanding, but the throughputs of indoor users are highly degraded. This is due to the additional wall and indoor losses (on top of the inherently high path loss at mmWave frequencies), which further reduce the SINR of indoor users. Therefore, techniques that significantly enhance the SINR are highly import ant design considerations in unleashing the amazing prospects and potentials of mmWave UDNs.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8387217/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 June 2018","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2018","publicationDate":"June 2018","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8387217/","dateOfInsertion":"18 June 2018","accessionNumber":"17840118","volume":"56","issue":"6","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"5G Millimeter-Wave Mobile Broadband: Performance and Challenges","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"5G Millimeter-Wave Mobile Broadband: Performance and Challenges","sourcePdf":"030BUSARI_LAYOUT.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.094515S","chronDate":"June  2018","xplore-pub-id":"35","isNumber":"8387185","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"35","citationCount":"35","xplore-issue":"8387185","articleId":"8387217","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-09"},{"_id":8387218,"authors":[{"name":"Alexandros-Apostolos A.

We provide two possible electro-optical baseband interface architectures, namely transparent optical-link and digital- link architectures, which are currently under investigation. THz wireless link requirements are given as well as the main principles and research directions for the development of a new generation of transceiver front-ends that will be capable of operating at ultra-high spectral efficiency by employing higher-order modulation schemes. Moreover, we discuss the need for developing a novel THz network information theory framework, which will take into account the channel characteristics and the nature of interference in the THz band.

Therefore, in this article, we draw a potential map of THz vehicle transmission for autonomous vehicles to break the blockage of short-range and unstable links. First, we give a brief overview of possible waveforms followed by the specific channel at 0.1-1 THz. Then we propose an autonomous relay algorithm called ATLR for the gigabit-level communication in the high-speed road environment.

However, the terahertz band brings novel challenges, never addressed at lower frequencies. Among others, the scattering of terahertz waves from any object, including walls and furniture, and ultra-wideband highly directional links lead to fundamentally new propagation and interference structures. In this article, we review the recent progress in terahertz propagation modeling, and antenna and testbed designs, and propose a step-by-step roadmap for wireless terahertz Ethernet extension for indoor environments. As a side effect, the described concept provides a second life to the currently underutilized Ethernet infrastructure by using it as a universally available backbone. By applying real terahertz band propagation, reflection, and scattering measurements as well as ray-tracing simulations of a typical office, we analyze two representative scenarios at 300 GHz and 1.25 THz frequencies, illustrating that extremely high rates can be achieved with realistic system parameters at room scales.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Last Meter Indoor Terahertz Wireless Access: Performance Insights and Implementation Roadmap","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Magazine","doi":"10.1109/MCOM.2018.1600300","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel7/35/8387185/08387220.pdf","startPage":"158","endPage":"165","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MCOM.2018.1600300","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8387185","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8387220","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8387220/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 June 2018","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2018","displayDocTitle":"Last Meter Indoor Terahertz Wireless Access: Performance Insights and Implementation Roadmap","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"56","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/8387220/","dateOfInsertion":"18 June 2018","publicationDate":"June 2018","accessionNumber":"17840120","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Last Meter Indoor Terahertz Wireless Access: Performance Insights and Implementation Roadmap","sourcePdf":"033PETROV_LAYOUT.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.042873S","chronDate":"June  2018","xplore-pub-id":"35","isNumber":"8387185","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"35","citationCount":"26","xplore-issue":"8387185","articleId":"8387220","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8387221,"authors":[{"name":"Ryszard Struzak","affiliation":["National Institute of Telecommunications"],"bio":{"p":["Ryszard Struzak [LF] (r.struzak@ieee.org) is a full professor at the National Institute of Telecommunications.

An effective method for inbound marketing is creation of a positive psychological business environment to attract the customers. A significant portion of traditional business environment is moving online and the new business environment is the company website. One of the major elements in online inbound marketing is the website address and the website logo, which are the first factors of brand personality that the visitor to the company website encounters when looking up the website in a search engine. In this paper, a framework for inbound e-marketing using visual and phonetic user experience analytics is proposed. The popular websites are studied and the relationship between website page views and the English phonetic construction of the website address and its logo are analyzed. For demonstrating the relationship between the website logo and name and its appeal to the customers, the proposed model is trained by a neural network. The proposed model is capable to predict website page views based on the company logo and the website address. The experimental results show that the proposed framework is capable of recommending the strategy for inbound marketing for online business and services with high accuracy.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-26 April 2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8387231/","accessionNumber":"17857932","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8387231/","publicationDate":"April 2018","dateOfInsertion":"18 June 2018","conferenceDate":"25-26 April 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Inbound e-marketing using neural network based visual and phonetic user experience analytics","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Inbound e-marketing using neural network based visual and phonetic user experience analytics","confLoc":"Tehran, Iran","sourcePdf":"ICWR201803.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069113S","chronDate":"25-26 April 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8375672","isNumber":"8387228","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8375672","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"8387228","articleId":"8387231","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8387236,"authors":[{"name":"Majid Derakhshan","affiliation":["Computer Engineering, University of Science and Culture, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Majid","lastName":"Derakhshan","id":"37086395542"},{"name":"Zohreh Bateni","affiliation":["Computer Engineering, Science and Culture, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Zohreh","lastName":"Bateni","id":"37086396174"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-5364-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-5386-5363-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-5365-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8387236","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":342},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Task analysis","Cloud computing","Scheduling algorithms","Heuristic algorithms","Virtual machining","Optimization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","minimax techniques","resource allocation","scheduling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","scheduling algorithms","prioritization algorithm","TOMMP algorithms","task optimization","MAX-MIN algorithms","MAX-MIN algorithms","priority algorithms"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["TOMMP algorithm","optimal scheduling algorithm","scheduling algorithm","cloud scheduling algorithm","Min-Min algorithm","Max-Min algorithm","cloud computing"]}],"abstract":"Considering the growing use of cloud computing and the need for optimal use of resources in the cloud, and attention to users that pay for services they use based on their pay-as-you-go basis, There should be a quicker way for users to decrease the user's waiting time and task's waiting time.

There are a lot of scheduling algorithms in the world today, but the priority given to the tasks has been neglected and overlooked in most algorithms. In this algorithm, priority is firstly selected for tasks based on a prioritization algorithm, and then using the median number to decide which one of the Min-Min or Max-Min algorithms is to be used.

Since goals other than makespan should be considered in the real-world scheduling and these goals are contradictor in most cases, the workflow scheduling problem is a NP-Hard problem. Considering the complexities of the scheduling problem, multi-objective metaheuristic algorithms are a good option for solving such problems. These algorithms help service providers find a set of optimal tradeoffs of solutions. An important criterion in finding this tradeoff is diversity in the choice of solutions. By adding this criterion to the multi-objective evolutionary algorithms, one can achieve a set of optimal solutions. Given the importance of this criterion, we extended the Black Hole heuristic algorithm and then presented a new multi-objective algorithm based on the diversity criteria for workflow scheduling in the cloud environment. The purpose of the proposed algorithm is to search for the problem space and find the non-dominated Pareto front to optimize the Resource efficiency, Makespan and Cost factors in the cloud environment. In order to achieve this goal, we not only increased the diversity of solutions, but also modified the layout type of initial solutions based on the priority of requests in the workflow, and created a more appropriate initial generation to enhance the purposefulness of our search. The results obtained from the WorkflowSim show that the proposed method improves the balanced and unbalanced workflow better than do the known algorithms of SPEA2 and NSGA2 and PBHO.","doi":"10.1109/ICWR.2018.8387254","publicationTitle":"2018 4th International Conference on Web Research (ICWR)","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 4th International Conference on Web Research (ICWR)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8375672/8387228/08387254.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICWR.2018.8387254","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8387228","startPage":"162","endPage":"167","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A modified black hole-based multi-objective workflow scheduling improved using the priority queues for cloud computing environment","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8387254","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A modified black hole-based multi-objective workflow scheduling improved using the priority queues for cloud computing environment","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-26 April 2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8387254/","conferenceDate":"25-26 April 2018","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2018","accessionNumber":"17844300","dateOfInsertion":"18 June 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8387254/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A modified black hole-based multi-objective workflow scheduling improved using the priority queues for cloud computing environment","confLoc":"Tehran, Iran","sourcePdf":"ICWR201826.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.089929S","chronDate":"25-26 April 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8375672","isNumber":"8387228","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8375672","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"8387228","articleId":"8387254","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8387268,"authors":[{"name":"Shubh Lakshmi","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Electrical Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology, Guwahati, India"],"firstName":"Shubh","lastName":"Lakshmi","id":"37085646263"},{"name":"Sanjib Ganguly","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Electrical Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology, Guwahati, India"],"firstName":"Sanjib","lastName":"Ganguly","id":"37395359200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1789-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1788-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1790-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8387268","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":182},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8387268","abstract":"This paper presents a planning approach for the integration of open unified power quality conditioner (UPQC-O) in a distribution network to improve its power loss and power quality (PQ). In UPQC-O model, the series and shunt inverters are not connected to a common DC-link. The shunt inverter is used to eliminate the harmonics created by the load and to provide reactive power compensation. The series inverter is used for dual-purpose, i.e., for the protection of all its downstream loads from voltage sag, and to provide reactive power compensation in healthy condition. The objective function is formulated as the minimization of energy loss under the voltage, thermal overloading, and the desirable PQ constraints so as to determine the location(s) and size(s) of these two inverters. The particle swarm optimization (PSO) is used as the solution strategy. The UPQC-O model is incorporated into the forward-backward sweep load flow algorithm, which is used as the support subroutine for the PSO-based planning algorithm. The results show that the optimal placement of the UPQC-O provides significant power loss reduction, bus voltage improvement, and better PQ.","doi":"10.1109/ICPES.2017.8387268","startPage":"55","endPage":"60","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 7th International Conference on Power Systems (ICPS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8376164/8387258/08387268.pdf","publicationTitle":"2017 7th International Conference on Power Systems (ICPS)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICPES.2017.8387268","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8387258","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Energy loss minimization with open unified power quality conditioner placement in radial distribution networks using particle swarm optimization","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Inverters","Power quality","Planning","Load modeling","Reactive power","Energy loss","Harmonic analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distribution networks","invertors","load flow","particle swarm optimisation","power supply quality","reactive power"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["energy loss minimization","open unified power quality conditioner placement","radial distribution networks","particle swarm optimization","planning approach","distribution network","UPQC-O model","shunt inverters","common DC-link","reactive power compensation","series inverter","downstream loads","voltage sag","desirable PQ constraints","forward-backward sweep load flow algorithm","optimal placement","significant power loss reduction","bus voltage improvement","thermal overloading","inverters"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Electrical distribution systems","power loss","power quality","unified power quality conditioner"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8387268/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-23 Dec. 2017","displayDocTitle":"Energy loss minimization with open unified power quality conditioner placement in radial distribution networks using particle swarm optimization","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8387268/","publicationDate":"Dec. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"18 June 2018","conferenceDate":"21-23 Dec. 2017","accessionNumber":"17858053","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy loss minimization with open unified power quality conditioner placement in radial distribution networks using particle swarm optimization","confLoc":"Pune, India","sourcePdf":"ICPS2017Paper029.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072022S","chronDate":"21-23 Dec. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8376164","isNumber":"8387258","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8376164","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"8387258","articleId":"8387268","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8387279,"authors":[{"name":"Himadri Lala","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Institute of Technology Rourkela, Rourkela, India"],"firstName":"Himadri","lastName":"Lala","id":"37085818985"},{"name":"Subrata Karmakar","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Institute of Technology Rourkela, Rourkela, India"],"firstName":"Subrata","lastName":"Karmakar","id":"37410149300"},{"name":"Sanjib Ganguly","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Electrical Engineering, IIT Guwahati, Assam, India"],"firstName":"Sanjib","lastName":"Ganguly","id":"37395359200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1789-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1788-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1790-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8387279","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":190},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Circuit faults","Discrete wavelet transforms","Continuous wavelet transforms","Transient analysis","Feature extraction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fault diagnosis","feature extraction","learning (artificial intelligence)","load distribution","neural nets","power engineering computing","time-frequency analysis","wavelet transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distribution system faults","transient signal","machine-learning","artificial neural network","fault transients","fault detection","fault diagnosis","distribution power system","short-circuit faults","localization algorithm","stationary wavelet transform","time-frequency based detection"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Artificial neural network","Distribution system","Fault detection","Fault localization","Wavelet transform"]}],"abstract":"Short-circuit faults are the most commonly occurred transient events in a distribution system.

The voltage of dc sources are considered as a variable which varies linearly with variation in output voltage. The first low-order harmonic present in the output voltage of L-level inverter is L - 2.

are interconnected. Among them, one market has energy-only market, whereas other has both capacity and energy market. Generation companies (GenCos) are made optimal capacity allocation in different markets to maximize their revenue. Similarly, the independent system operator (ISO) is tried to purchase needed capacity and energy with the purchase cost as minimum as possible. Additionally, both these problems are recognized as GenCos revenue maximization and ISOs purchase cost minimization problems. Furthermore, both these problems are nonlinear, multi-variables, stochastic and constrained optimization problems. It couldn't be solved by classical methods. Therefore, one of the well known, population-based, meta-heuristic optimization algorithm such as particle swarm optimization algorithm (PSO) is used to solve the above-mentioned problems.

The EWT decomposes the signal into its frequency components adaptively; however, the estimation of PQIs require only the fundamental and non-fundamental components. Therefore, the algorithm aims to extract only the fundamental frequency component accurately by designing an adaptive wavelet filter.

In this paper, fuel cost and pollutants emission functions are considered together and formulated as a multi-objective optimization problem. The objective function for Economic Load Dispatch and Economic Emission Dispatch are assumed to be a quadratic non-linear one. So the overall objective function for Economic Emission Load Dispatch is nonlinear and complex in nature.

Relay coordination in microgrids is complex because of varied and bidirectional fault currents because of the existence of Distributed Generation (DG). Overcurrent relays are the feasible and economic choice of protection for meshed distribution systems. The coordinated relay settings must account for various possible fault scenarios in both grid connected and isolated microgrid modes of operation. Inadequate fault current levels from grid connected to the isolated mode are the major cause of protection miscoordination. This paper systematically formulates the relay coordination problem for microgrids as a linear interval optimization problem and introduces a new method of solution using hybrid GA - ILP method. The challenge in using GA to find the optimum in less number of iterations and the feasibility of ILP method to include various fault scenarios as \u201cuncertain but bounded\u201d intervals are combined to find the optimal overcurrent relay settings. The results show the effectiveness of proposed method. The programming is done using optimization tool box available in Matlab.","doi":"10.1109/ICPES.2017.8387396","publicationTitle":"2017 7th International Conference on Power Systems (ICPS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 7th International Conference on Power Systems (ICPS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8376164/8387258/08387396.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICPES.2017.8387396","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8387258","startPage":"785","endPage":"790","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A hybrid GA \u2014 Interval linear programming implementation for microgrid relay coordination considering different fault locations","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8387396","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A hybrid GA \u2014 Interval linear programming implementation for microgrid relay coordination considering different fault locations","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-23 Dec. 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8387396/","conferenceDate":"21-23 Dec. 2017","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2017","accessionNumber":"17858007","dateOfInsertion":"18 June 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8387396/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A hybrid GA \u2014 Interval linear programming implementation for microgrid relay coordination considering different fault locations","confLoc":"Pune, India","sourcePdf":"ICPS2017Paper418.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062379S","chronDate":"21-23 Dec. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8376164","isNumber":"8387258","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8376164","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"8387258","articleId":"8387396","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8387401,"authors":[{"name":"P.

Next, the digital elevation model data reflecting the elevation information and the SAR image grayscale information are fused as the input to the network.

In particular, our proposed framework first partitions the user equipments (UEs) with different mobility patterns into clusters, where the mobility patterns are similar in the same cluster. Then, within each cluster, an asynchronous multiuser deep reinforcement learning (RL) scheme is developed to control the HO processes across the UEs in each cluster, in the goal of lowering the HO rate while ensuring certain system throughput. In this scheme, we use a deep neural network (DNN) as an HO controller learned by each UE via RL in a collaborative fashion. Moreover, we use supervised learning in initializing the DNN controller before the execution of RL to exploit what we already know with traditional HO schemes and to mitigate the negative effects of random exploration at the initial stage. Furthermore, we show that the adopted global-parameter-based asynchronous framework enables us to train faster with more UEs, which could nicely address the scalability issue to support large systems. Finally, simulation results demonstrate that the proposed framework can achieve better performance than the state-of-art online schemes, in terms of HO rates.","chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/6488907/8614370/8387430-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8387430/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 June 2018","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2018","volume":"5","issue":"6","dateOfInsertion":"16 January 2019","publicationDate":"Dec. 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8387430/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Handover Control in Wireless Systems via Asynchronous Multiuser Deep Reinforcement Learning","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61629101"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"DMS-1622433, AST-1547436, ECCS-1659025 and CNS-1343155"},{"fundingName":"China Scholarships Council"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","chorusFlag":"true","title":"Handover Control in Wireless Systems via Asynchronous Multiuser Deep Reinforcement Learning","sourcePdf":"jiot-cui-2848295-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.134781S","chronDate":"Dec.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"6488907","isNumber":"8614370","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6488907","citationCount":"31","xplore-issue":"8614370","articleId":"8387430","onlineDate":"18 June 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8387436,"authors":[{"name":"Paul N.

To reach the required low energy consumption, we exploit the key properties of neural network algorithms: parallelism, data reuse, small/sparse data, and noise tolerance. We map the algorithm to a very large scale integration (VLSI) architecture based around an singleinstruction, multiple-data data path with hardware support to exploit data sparsity by completely eliding unnecessary computation and data movement. This approach exploits sparsity, without compromising the parallel computation. We also exploit the inherent algorithmic noise-tolerance of neural networks, by introducing circuit-level timing violation detection to allow worst case voltage guard-bands to be minimized. The resulting intermittent timing violations may result in logic errors, which conventionally need to be corrected. However, in lieu of explicit error correction, we cope with this by accentuating the noise tolerance of neural networks.

By combining the NPHE scheme and the common nonlinear programming method, the distribution of offset quadrature amplitude modulation based optical orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OQAM-OFDM) signal is accurately estimated and then it is used to achieve the optimal nonuniform quantization level. In this way, the low-level signal can achieve much more effective digitalizing bits, thereby significantly reducing the quantization noise. The numerical simulation and experiment with 10-Gb/s 16-order OQAM-OFDM signal over 20 km fiber are conducted to further verify the feasibility of our scheme. The results show that our scheme always outperforms the uniform quantization and Gaussian-like nonuniform schemes in terms of the signal to quantization noise ratio, error-vector-magnitudes, and bit error rate. Compared to the conventional method, our scheme also achieves received sensitivity improvement thereby improving the system power budget. So, it can support the low-bit resolution transmission in intensity modulated direct detection-based OQAM-OFDM system.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Photonics Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/4563994/8392551/08387444.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"13","publicationTitle":"IEEE Photonics Journal","doi":"10.1109/JPHOT.2018.2848248","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JPHOT.2018.2848248","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8392551","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8387444","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance Optimization by Nonparametric Histogram Estimation for Low Resolution in IMDD-OQAM-OFDM System","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Quantization (signal)","Histograms","Estimation","Probability density function","Optical fibers","Optical fiber sensors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel bank filters","error statistics","intensity modulation","nonlinear programming","OFDM modulation","quadrature amplitude modulation","quantisation (signal)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["performance optimization","IMDD-OQAM-OFDM system","nonparametric histogram estimation scheme","intensity modulated direct detection","filter bank multicarrier signal","NPHE scheme","offset quadrature amplitude modulation","optimal nonuniform quantization level","low-level signal","numerical simulation","Gaussian-like nonuniform schemes","bit error rate","low-bit resolution transmission","nonlinear programming method","optical orthogonal frequency division multiplexing signal","OQAM-OFDM signal"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Nonparametric histogram estimation","nonlinear programming","optical OQAM-OFDM","clipping ratio (CR)","the IFFT/FFT bit precision."]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8387444/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2018","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 June 2018","displayDocTitle":"Performance Optimization by Nonparametric Histogram Estimation for Low Resolution in IMDD-OQAM-OFDM System","volume":"10","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/8387444/","impactStatement":"We firstly study nonparametric histogram estimation for DAC optimization which is used to achieve the optimal nonuniform quantization levels of OQAM-OFDM.

However, the existing NOMA systems have a fundamental limit: high computational complexity and a sharply changing wireless channel make exploiting the characteristics of the channel and deriving the ideal allocation methods very difficult tasks. To break this fundamental limit, in this paper, we propose a novel and effective deep learning (DL)-aided NOMA system, in which several NOMA users with random deployment are served by one base station. Since DL is advantageous in that it allows training the input signals and detecting sharply changing channel conditions, we exploit it to address wireless NOMA channels in an end-to-end manner. Specifically, it is employed in the proposed NOMA system to learn a completely unknown channel environment. A long short-term memory (LSTM) network based on DL is incorporated into a typical NOMA system, enabling the proposed scheme to detect the channel characteristics automatically. In the proposed strategy, the LSTM is first trained by simulated data under different channel conditions via offline learning, and then the corresponding output data can be obtained based on the current input data used during the online learning process. In general, we build, train and test the proposed cooperative framework to realize automatic encoding, decoding and channel detection in an additive white Gaussian noise channel. Furthermore, we regard one conventional user activity and data detection scheme as an unknown nonlinear mapping operation and use LSTM to approximate it to evaluate the data detection capacity of DL based on NOMA. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme is robust and efficient compared with conventional approaches. In addition, the accuracy of the LSTM-aided NOMA scheme is studied by introducing the well-known tenfold cross-validation procedure.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8387468/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 June 2018","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2018","volume":"67","issue":"9","accessionNumber":"18095115","dateOfInsertion":"17 September 2018","publicationDate":"Sept. 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8387468/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Deep Learning for an Effective Nonorthogonal Multiple Access Scheme","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61571240"},{"fundingName":"Jiangsu Specially Appointed Professor","grantNumber":"RK002STP16001"},{"fundingName":"Innovation and Entrepreneurship of Jiangsu High-level Talent","grantNumber":"CZ0010617002"},{"fundingName":"1311 Talent Plan"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Deep Learning for an Effective Nonorthogonal Multiple Access Scheme","sourcePdf":"tvt-gui-2848294-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.138198S","chronDate":"Sept.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"8466982","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"252","xplore-issue":"8466982","articleId":"8387468","onlineDate":"18 June 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8387470,"authors":[{"name":"Ibrahim A.

However, these devices exhibit limitations, such as short battery lifetime, limited computation power, small memory size and unpredictable network connectivity. Therefore, numerous solutions have been proposed to mitigate these limitations and extend the battery lifetime with the use of the offloading technique. In this paper, a novel framework is proposed to offload intensive computation tasks from the mobile device to the cloud. This framework uses an optimization model to determine the offloading decision dynamically based on four main parameters, namely, energy consumption, CPU utilization, execution time, and memory usage. In addition, a new security layer is provided to protect the transferred data in the cloud from any attack. The experimental results showed that the framework can select a suitable offloading decision for different types of mobile application tasks while achieving significant performance improvement. Moreover, different from previous techniques, the framework can protect application data from any threat.","doi":"10.1109/TCC.2018.2847347","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Cloud Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Cloud Computing","pdfPath":"/iel7/6245519/9371451/08387470.pdf","startPage":"79","endPage":"87","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCC.2018.2847347","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9371451","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Efficient and Secured Framework for Mobile Cloud Computing","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8387470/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 June 2018","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.-March 1 2021","displayDocTitle":"An Efficient and Secured Framework for Mobile Cloud Computing","volume":"9","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"1 Jan.-March 2021","accessionNumber":"20408968","htmlLink":"/document/8387470/","dateOfInsertion":"05 March 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"National Key Research and Development Plan","grantNumber":"2016YFB0800801"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61672186 and 61472108"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Efficient and Secured Framework for Mobile Cloud Computing","sourcePdf":"tcc-elgendy-2847347-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.097747S","chronDate":"Jan.-March 1 2021","xplore-pub-id":"6245519","isNumber":"9371451","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6245519","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"9371451","articleId":"8387470","onlineDate":"18 June 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-09"},{"_id":8387473,"authors":[{"name":"Chao Liu","affiliation":["Research Base of Beijing Modern Manufacturing Industry Development, Beijing University of Technology, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4235/8676364/8387473/liu-2848254-small.gif","p":["Chao Liu received the Ph.D. degree from Tianjin University, Tianjin, China, in 2009.","He is currently a Professor with the College of Economics and Management, Beijing University of Technology, Beijing, China.

However, the strategies of balancing convergence and diversity and the effectiveness of handling problems with irregular Pareto fronts (PFs) are still far from perfect. To address these issues, this paper proposes an adaptive sorting-based evolutionary algorithm based on the idea of decomposition. First, we propose an adaptive sorting-based environmental selection strategy. Solutions in each subpopulation (partitioned by reference vectors) are sorted based on their convergence. Those with better convergence are further sorted based on their diversity, then being selected according to their sorting levels. Second, we provide an adaptive promising subpopulation sorting-based environmental selection strategy for problems which may have irregular PFs. This strategy provides additional sorting-based selection effort on promising subpopulations after the general environmental selection process. Third, we extend the algorithm to handle constraints. Finally, we conduct an extensive experimental study on the proposed algorithm by comparing with start-of-the-state algorithms. Results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed algorithm.","doi":"10.1109/TEVC.2018.2848254","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8676364","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TEVC.2018.2848254","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation","pdfPath":"/iel7/4235/8676364/08387473.pdf","startPage":"247","endPage":"257","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive Sorting-Based Evolutionary Algorithm for Many-Objective Optimization","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 June 2018","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive Sorting-Based Evolutionary Algorithm for Many-Objective Optimization","volume":"23","issue":"2","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2019","dateOfInsertion":"29 March 2019","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8387473/","publicationDate":"April 2019","accessionNumber":"18565546","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8387473/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61773029, 61273230, 61603010 and 61603011"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004543","fundingName":"China Scholarship Council"},{"fundingName":"Beijing Social Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"16JDGLC005"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive Sorting-Based Evolutionary Algorithm for Many-Objective Optimization","sourcePdf":"tevc-zhao-2848254-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.179507S","chronDate":"April  2019","xplore-pub-id":"4235","isNumber":"8676364","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4235","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"8676364","articleId":"8387473","onlineDate":"18 June 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8387475,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaoqiang Gu","affiliation":["Center for Research on Radio Frequency Electronics of Quebec and the Poly-GRAMES Research Center, \u00c9cole Polytechnique de Montr\u00e9al, Montreal, QC, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/22/8454363/8387475/gu-2842723-small.gif","p":["Xiaoqiang Gu (GS\u201917) was born in Changzhou, China, in 1990.

One single substrate board is demonstrated to accommodate and integrate an electromagnetic kinetic generator, an F-shaped antenna, and a rectifying circuit, having a compact credit-card size. Cooperative harvesting mode enables a significant enhancement of the diode's power conversion efficiency (PCE) and also greatly strengthening the resilience of harvester at the same time. Measured results suggest that SMS7630 and HSMS-2850-based cooperative harvesters can increase dc output power by 50% to around 100% when both injecting power sources exhibit below -37 dBm with reference to the total added amount of dc power harvested directly from separate RF and kinetic excitation modes. A closed-form method is proposed and used to predict the enhanced efficiency performance of the cooperative harvester within a low power range of interest (from -50 to -30 dBm). Our analysis highlights the roles of the diode's nonlinear junction resistance and capacitance. Good agreements are observed when comparing the analysis results with harmonic balance simulations by ADS. Furthermore, this method is carefully verified by measured results of two different diode-based harvesters. Measured dc output power rectified from cooperative harvesting mode is reported to be 1.16 and 1.97 times larger with SMS7630 and HSMS-2850, respectively, when both power sources are -40 dBm, compared to the conventional single RF harvesting mode. The proposed cooperative harvester with its strong resilience is highly suitable for ambient power harvesting in an ever-changing environment.","doi":"10.1109/TMTT.2018.2842723","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel7/22/8454363/08387475.pdf","startPage":"4178","endPage":"4190","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMTT.2018.2842723","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8454363","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Integrated Cooperative Ambient Power Harvester Collecting Ubiquitous Radio Frequency and Kinetic Energy","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8387475","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 June 2018","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8387475/","displayDocTitle":"Integrated Cooperative Ambient Power Harvester Collecting Ubiquitous Radio Frequency and Kinetic Energy","volume":"66","issue":"9","publicationDate":"Sept. 2018","accessionNumber":"18072700","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8387475/","dateOfInsertion":"03 September 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000038","fundingName":"Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Integrated Cooperative Ambient Power Harvester Collecting Ubiquitous Radio Frequency and Kinetic Energy","sourcePdf":"tmtt-gu-2842723-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.08617S","chronDate":"Sept.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"22","isNumber":"8454363","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"8454363","articleId":"8387475","onlineDate":"18 June 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-19"},{"_id":8387476,"authors":[{"name":"Wen Fan","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Information, Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi\u2019an, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/8399517/8387476/fan-2847636-small.gif","p":["Wen Fan was born in China.

Two new methods are proposed to achieve it via designing constant modulus (CM) waveforms directly: One is to maximize the ratio of the minimum mainlobe level to the peak sidelobe level (PSL) without specifying pattern masks, and another is to minimize PSL under the mainlobe ripple and unspecified waveform modulus constraints. The resultant optimization problems are difficult to solve due to the coupled numerator and denominator of the quadratic fractional programming problem formulation in the former and double-sided quadratic constraints and unknown waveform modulus in the latter. For the former, we decouple the numerator and denominator by equivalent transformation and introduction of boundary-type auxiliary variables in order that feasible methods are derived to tackle them independently and efficiently. For the latter, we simplify the coupled double-sided quadratic constraints on the same waveform vector into those on different single auxiliary variables to tackle the corresponding nonconvex optimization problem. Numerical examples show that the proposed algorithms can attain sufficient low peak sidelobe beampattern levels under the CM constraints.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2018.2847636","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/78/8399517/08387476.pdf","startPage":"4207","endPage":"4222","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2018.2847636","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8399517","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Constant Modulus MIMO Radar Waveform Design With Minimum Peak Sidelobe Transmit Beampattern","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8387476","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 June 2018","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.15, 15 2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8387476/","displayDocTitle":"Constant Modulus MIMO Radar Waveform Design With Minimum Peak Sidelobe Transmit Beampattern","volume":"66","issue":"16","publicationDate":"15 Aug.15, 2018","accessionNumber":"17875331","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8387476/","dateOfInsertion":"02 July 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61471295"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004750","fundingName":"Aeronautical Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"20172053017"},{"fundingName":"Central University Funds","grantNumber":"G2016KY0308, G2016KY0002 and 17GH030144"},{"fundingName":"Key Research Program of Frontier Sciences","grantNumber":"QYZDY-SSW-JSC035"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Constant Modulus MIMO Radar Waveform Design With Minimum Peak Sidelobe Transmit Beampattern","sourcePdf":"tsp-liang-2847636-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.139468S","chronDate":"Aug.15, 15 2018","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"8399517","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"41","xplore-issue":"8399517","articleId":"8387476","onlineDate":"18 June 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8387481,"authors":[{"name":"Kaustuv Nag","affiliation":["Department of Instrumentation and Electronics Engineering, Jadavpur University, Kolkata, India"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/91/8552527/8387481/nag-2848261-small.gif","p":["Kaustuv Nag (S\u201915\u2013M\u201918) received the B.Tech. degree\n in computer science and engineering from the West Bengal University of Technology, Kolkata, India, and the M.Tech.\n degree in computer science and engineering from the National Institute of Technology, Durgapur, India, in 2010 and\n 2012, respectively.

The preferences are provided either in the objective space or in the decision variable space using fuzzy numbers. To solve this problem, an indicator to measure consensus, an indicator to measure the robustness of the solutions to their degree of consensus, and a reformulation of the multiobjective robust optimization problem, are required. It is necessary for the reformulated problem to generate robust solutions that also enjoy high degree of consensus. In this paper, we have addressed these three issues. For this purpose, we have proposed two approaches to define consensus. Then, we have extended these approaches to define robust consensus, an indicator to measure the robustness of a given solution to its degree of consensus. Though these approaches can be used to define a countless number of measures, we have proposed 12 definitions of consensus, and hence, robust consensus. Furthermore, we have proposed two ways for the reformulation. Experimental results illustrate that the behavior of the proposed definitions and of the reformulations are consistent with our expectations.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/91/8552527/08387481.pdf","startPage":"3743","endPage":"3754","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems","doi":"10.1109/TFUZZ.2018.2848261","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TFUZZ.2018.2848261","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8552527","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8387481","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robust Multiobjective Optimization With Robust Consensus","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Robustness","Uncertainty","Decision making","Pareto optimization","Noise measurement","Instruments"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decision making","fuzzy set theory","optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["robust multiobjective optimization","robust consensus","multiobjective robust optimization problem","weighted decision makers","decision variable space","fuzzy numbers"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Consensus","evolutionary algorithms","fuzzy group decision making (FGDM)","multiobjective optimization","robustness"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8387481/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2018","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 June 2018","displayDocTitle":"Robust Multiobjective Optimization With Robust Consensus","volume":"26","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/8387481/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2018","accessionNumber":"18286444","dateOfInsertion":"29 November 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Department of Science and Technology, India","grantNumber":"IF120686"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust Multiobjective Optimization With Robust Consensus","sourcePdf":"tfuzz-pal-2848261-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.088245S","chronDate":"Dec.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"91","isNumber":"8552527","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"91","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"8552527","articleId":"8387481","onlineDate":"18 June 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8387506,"authors":[{"name":"Chee Cheow Lim","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Malaya, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Chee Cheow","lastName":"Lim","orcid":"0000-0002-1848-0634","id":"37085838196"},{"name":"Harikrishnan Ramiah","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Malaya, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Harikrishnan","lastName":"Ramiah","orcid":"0000-0003-3505-6525","id":"37297602000"},{"name":"Jun Yin","affiliation":["State-Key Laboratory of Analog and Mixed-Signal VLSI, University of Macau, Macau, China"],"firstName":"Jun","lastName":"Yin","orcid":"0000-0002-4195-4551","id":"37085444225"},{"name":"Narendra Kumar","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Malaya, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Narendra","lastName":"Kumar","id":"37588892700"},{"name":"Pui-In Mak","affiliation":["Faculty of Science and Technology\u2014ECE, University of Macau, Macau, China"],"firstName":"Pui-In","lastName":"Mak","orcid":"0000-0002-3579-8740","id":"37270203500"},{"name":"Rui P.

These types of converters are suitable for renewable and sustainable energy applications with low input dc sources. The proposed topology has the ability of self-voltage balancing and does not apply end side H-bridge to produce a bipolar staircase waveform. Consequently, switching losses and voltage stress of semiconductor components are reduced to a great extent. A small dc voltage source can be used to achieve a high voltage high quality ac waveform through switching the precharged capacitors in series and in parallel. Circuit configuration and its operation principle, capacitors' charging process, thermal model, capacitances, and losses calculations are discussed in details. Moreover, the comparison of the proposed circuit with the other single source multilevel converters shows that the proposed topology reduces the number of circuit elements. Finally, a laboratory nine-level prototype is built to verify the theoretical analyses and feasibility of the proposed topology. The experimental results show that the converter efficiency at 1 KW output power is 92.75%.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8387509/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 June 2018","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2019","volume":"34","issue":"4","accessionNumber":"18510208","dateOfInsertion":"11 March 2019","publicationDate":"April 2019","htmlLink":"/document/8387509/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A Novel Step-Up Single Source Multilevel Inverter: Topology, Operating Principle, and Modulation","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Novel Step-Up Single Source Multilevel Inverter: Topology, Operating Principle, and Modulation","sourcePdf":"tpel-hosseini-2848359-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.143012S","chronDate":"April  2019","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"8664410","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"63","xplore-issue":"8664410","articleId":"8387509","onlineDate":"18 June 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8387518,"authors":[{"name":"Gang Chen","affiliation":["College of Automation, Chongqing University, Chongqing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5165411/8741221/8387518/chen-2848282-small.gif","p":["Gang Chen (M\u201916) received the Ph.D. degree in control engineering from Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China, in 2006.

To resolve this issue, a novel event-triggered optimal active power control strategy, which achieves frequency regulation and economic operation in a fully distributed way, is proposed in this paper. Frequency deviations are monitored and used to trigger the load estimation algorithm to track changes in power demand. Based on estimated demand values, a distributed economic dispatch (ED) algorithm, which only requires that the communication topology satisfies the jointly connected condition, is proposed to calculate the optimal generation references for the generators. The ED algorithm has the finite-time convergence property, which is rigorously proved by Lyapunov theory, LaSalle's invariance principle and homogeneous property. Based on optimal generation references, the parameters of droop controller are reset in real time, which makes microgrid achieve frequency restoration and economic operation simultaneously. Finally, several case studies are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed control strategy.","doi":"10.1109/TSG.2018.2848282","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8741221","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSG.2018.2848282","endPage":"4025","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid","pdfPath":"/iel7/5165411/8741221/08387518.pdf","startPage":"4015","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Event-Triggered Optimal Active Power Control in Islanded Microgrid With Variable Demand and Time-Varying Communication Topology","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 June 2018","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2019","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8387518/","displayDocTitle":"Event-Triggered Optimal Active Power Control in Islanded Microgrid With Variable Demand and Time-Varying Communication Topology","volume":"10","issue":"4","accessionNumber":"18792082","dateOfInsertion":"19 June 2019","htmlLink":"/document/8387518/","publicationDate":"July 2019","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61673077"},{"fundingName":"Basic and Advanced Research Project of Chongqing","grantNumber":"CSTC 2016jcyjA0361"},{"fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities","grantNumber":"106112017CDJQJ178827"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Event-Triggered Optimal Active Power Control in Islanded Microgrid With Variable Demand and Time-Varying Communication Topology","sourcePdf":"tsg-chen-2848282-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.150647S","chronDate":"July  2019","xplore-pub-id":"5165411","isNumber":"8741221","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5165411","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"8741221","articleId":"8387518","onlineDate":"18 June 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8387520,"authors":[{"name":"Ketemaw Addis Mekonnen","affiliation":["Institute for Photonic Integration, Eindhoven University of Technology, Eindhoven, The Netherlands"],"bio":{"p":["Authors\u2019 biographies not available at the time of publication."]},"firstName":"Ketemaw Addis","lastName":"Mekonnen","orcid":"0000-0002-6005-1200","id":"37085622278"},{"name":"Eduward Tangdiongga","affiliation":["Institute for Photonic Integration, Eindhoven University of Technology, Eindhoven, The Netherlands"],"bio":{"p":["Authors\u2019 biographies not available at the time of publication."]},"firstName":"Eduward","lastName":"Tangdiongga","orcid":"0000-0002-9145-8273","id":"37265715300"},{"name":"A.

Though successive interference cancellation (SIC) is the key aspect of NOMA in the current wireless communication systems, the proposed NOMA-based approach introduces the concept of multiple interference cancellation (MIC), which stimulates the phenomenon of cancellation of interference levels in the network, involving optimal resource allocation. The interference reduction achieved with MIC is way below SIC. Such a framework improves the receiver's signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR), as shall be examined. Promising gains are provided by the proposed scheme, in terms of sum rate of the network, total energy-efficiency (EE), and fairness factor (FF). MIC reduces the power levels at the regenerators, achieving considerable circuit power saving. Another important redressal of the proposed scheme is the reduced level of complexity achieved with MIC. The implications of proposing MIC in the NOMA-D2D networks are evaluated through simulation results.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8387521/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 June 2018","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2018","publicationDate":"Sept. 2018","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8387521/","dateOfInsertion":"10 September 2018","accessionNumber":"18094687","volume":"15","issue":"3","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Green NOMA With Multiple Interference Cancellation (MIC) Using Sector-Based Resource Allocation","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"5G and IoT Laboratory, Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering and TBIC, Shri Mata Vaishno Devi University, Katra, Jammu, India"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Green NOMA With Multiple Interference Cancellation (MIC) Using Sector-Based Resource Allocation","sourcePdf":"tnsm-jha-2848595-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.119272S","chronDate":"Sept.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"4275028","isNumber":"8457428","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4275028","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"8457428","articleId":"8387521","onlineDate":"18 June 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8387526,"authors":[{"name":"Zheng Zhang","affiliation":["School of Information Technology & Electrical Engineering, The University of Queensland, Brisbane, QLD, Australia"],"firstName":"Zheng","lastName":"Zhang","orcid":"0000-0003-1470-6998","id":"37085560453"},{"name":"Li Liu","affiliation":["Inception Institute of Artificial Intelligence, Abu Dhabi, UAE"],"firstName":"Li","lastName":"Liu","id":"37085560508"},{"name":"Fumin Shen","affiliation":["Center for Future Media, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Fumin","lastName":"Shen","orcid":"0000-0001-7303-3231","id":"38236992700"},{"name":"Heng Tao Shen","affiliation":["Center for Future Media, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Heng Tao","lastName":"Shen","orcid":"0000-0002-2999-2088","id":"37279492800"},{"name":"Ling Shao","affiliation":["Inception Institute of Artificial Intelligence, Abu Dhabi, UAE"],"firstName":"Ling","lastName":"Shao","orcid":"0000-0002-8264-6117","id":"38265369400"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0162-8828"},{"format":"CD","value":"2160-9292"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1939-3539"}],"articleNumber":"8387526","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":37,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":2743},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computer Society","url":"http://www.computer.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8387526","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Binary codes","Optimization","Clustering methods","Collaboration","Convergence","Complexity theory","Visualization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data structures","image representation","learning (artificial intelligence)","matrix decomposition","optimisation","pattern clustering"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compact common binary code space","collaborative binary representations","binary matrix factorization model","cluster structures","binary data representations","cluster centroids","large-scale multiview image datasets","large-scale image data","BMVC","multiview image data","binary clustering structure learning","joint learning framework","multiview image descriptors","collaborative discrete representation learning","binary multiview clustering framework"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Large-scale clustering","multi-view data","efficient","short binary code","discrete representation"]}],"abstract":"Clustering is a long-standing important research problem, however, remains challenging when handling large-scale image data from diverse sources. In this paper, we present a novel Binary Multi-View Clustering (BMVC) framework, which can dexterously manipulate multi-view image data and easily scale to large data. To achieve this goal, we formulate BMVC by two key components: compact collaborative discrete representation learning and binary clustering structure learning, in a joint learning framework. Specifically, BMVC collaboratively encodes the multi-view image descriptors into a compact common binary code space by considering their complementary information; the collaborative binary representations are meanwhile clustered by a binary matrix factorization model, such that the cluster structures are optimized in the Hamming space by pure, extremely fast bit-operations. For efficiency, the code balance constraints are imposed on both binary data representations and cluster centroids. Finally, the resulting optimization problem is solved by an alternating optimization scheme with guaranteed fast convergence. Extensive experiments on four large-scale multi-view image datasets demonstrate that the proposed method enjoys the significant reduction in both computation and memory footprint, while observing superior (in most cases) or very competitive performance, in comparison with state-of-the-art clustering methods.","doi":"10.1109/TPAMI.2018.2847335","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8730438","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPAMI.2018.2847335","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel7/34/8730438/08387526.pdf","startPage":"1774","endPage":"1782","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Binary Multi-View Clustering","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 June 2018","displayDocTitle":"Binary Multi-View Clustering","volume":"41","issue":"7","chronOrPublicationDate":"July 1 2019","dateOfInsertion":"04 June 2019","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8387526/","publicationDate":"1 July 2019","accessionNumber":"18735924","pubMedId":"29994652","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8387526/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61502081, 61702117 and 61632007"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004000","fundingName":"Guangzhou Science and Technology Program key projects","grantNumber":"201804010355"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Binary Multi-View Clustering","sourcePdf":"tpami-shao-2847335-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.166384S","chronDate":"July 1 2019","xplore-pub-id":"34","isNumber":"8730438","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"37","xplore-issue":"8730438","articleId":"8387526","onlineDate":"18 June 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8387555,"authors":[{"name":"Fendy Santoso","affiliation":["School of Engineering and Information Technology, The University of of New South Wales, Canberra, Australia"],"firstName":"Fendy","lastName":"Santoso","id":"37599366100"},{"name":"Matthew A.

So, controlling for quadrotor that can trace the centroid position with optimal distribution, is needed. In this research, avoiding collisions among the quadrotors is required. In this paper, Modified ANN-self organizing map method is proposed. Modifications are made with the development of neurons which is a part of the map optimization feature by using Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) method. ANN-SOM is used to identify the initial movement of quadrotor members. When it has been identified, the movement of quadrotors swarm to the centroid point will be done using the PSO method. To avoid the collision at the centroid point, the minimum value of the distance of each quadrotor member is determined by the PSO method. Based on the simulation result, the proposed method is able to control the quadrotor swarm in centroid point tracing optimally with minimum variance and able to avoid collisions among quadrotor swarm members.","doi":"10.1109/ICAMIMIA.2017.8387588","pdfPath":"/iel7/8379923/8387547/08387588.pdf","startPage":"209","endPage":"213","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 International Conference on Advanced Mechatronics, Intelligent Manufacture, and Industrial Automation (ICAMIMIA)","publicationTitle":"2017 International Conference on Advanced Mechatronics, Intelligent Manufacture, and Industrial Automation (ICAMIMIA)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICAMIMIA.2017.8387588","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8387547","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Quadrotors distribution controlling for swarm centroid detection using a modified artificial neural network self-organizing map (Modified ANN-SOM)","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8387588/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 Oct. 2017","displayDocTitle":"Quadrotors distribution controlling for swarm centroid detection using a modified artificial neural network self-organizing map (Modified ANN-SOM)","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"18 June 2018","accessionNumber":"17844344","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8387588/","conferenceDate":"12-14 Oct. 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Quadrotors distribution controlling for swarm centroid detection using a modified artificial neural network self-organizing map (Modified ANN-SOM)","confLoc":"Surabaya, Indonesia","sourcePdf":"1570397987.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045311S","chronDate":"12-14 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8379923","isNumber":"8387547","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8379923","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8387547","articleId":"8387588","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-12"},{"_id":8387591,"authors":[{"name":"Md Meftahul Ferdaus","affiliation":["University of New South Wales, Sydney, NSW, AU"],"firstName":"Md Meftahul","lastName":"Ferdaus"},{"name":"Sreenatha G.

Precise mathematical model of quadcopter considering uncertainties is necessary for the better performance of the commonly used first principle based controllers. However, modelling quadcopter incorporating uncertainties is hard to achieve. A solution to the problem is the utilization of modelfree data-driven methods. An evolving intelligent system (EIS) based data-driven technique called evolving Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy inference system (eTS) is employed in this paper for online identification of a quadcopter from realtime experimental data.

The maximum power output on the PV characteristic curve can be achieved using the MPPT algorithm. MPPT algorithm widely developed from conventional Algorithm up to AI algorithm. Hence, in this paper discussed the comparison of FPA (Flower Pollination Algorithm), MPSO (Modified Particle Swarm Optimization), and P&O (Perturb and Observe) methods in MPPT coupled inductor SEPIC converter on DC Microgrid Isolated System. Sepic converter used to reduce ripple current in part of input. Furthermore, simulated performance experiments show that all three methods were able to find the maximum power point with an accuracy greater than 95%. The simulation results show that the FPA method is superior compared to the MPSO and P&O methods.","doi":"10.1109/ICAMIMIA.2017.8387604","startPage":"291","endPage":"296","publicationTitle":"2017 International Conference on Advanced Mechatronics, Intelligent Manufacture, and Industrial Automation (ICAMIMIA)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICAMIMIA.2017.8387604","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8387547","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 International Conference on Advanced Mechatronics, Intelligent Manufacture, and Industrial Automation (ICAMIMIA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8379923/8387547/08387604.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Comparison method of flower pollination algorithm, modified particle swarm optimization and perturb & observe in MPPT coupled inductor sepic converter on DC microgrid isolated system","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8387604/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Comparison method of flower pollination algorithm, modified particle swarm optimization and perturb & observe in MPPT coupled inductor sepic converter on DC microgrid isolated system","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8387604/","accessionNumber":"17858078","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"18 June 2018","conferenceDate":"12-14 Oct. 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 Oct. 2017","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Comparison method of flower pollination algorithm, modified particle swarm optimization and perturb & observe in MPPT coupled inductor sepic converter on DC microgrid isolated system","confLoc":"Surabaya, Indonesia","sourcePdf":"1570399561.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.07674S","chronDate":"12-14 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8379923","isNumber":"8387547","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8379923","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"8387547","articleId":"8387604","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-10"},{"_id":8387619,"authors":[{"name":"Ahmad Jobran Al-Mahasneh","affiliation":["School of Engineering and Information Technology, The University of New South Wales at the Australian Defense Force Academey, Canberra, ACT, Australia"],"firstName":"Ahmad Jobran","lastName":"Al-Mahasneh","id":"37086189593"},{"name":"Sreenatha G.

The algorithm for automatic confirmation of transactions has already been successfully applied in accounting, postal services, and smart devices. Additionally, people can participate in the confirmation of transactions. This article considers the possibility of using the technology in creating distributed networks of industrial equipment, i.e. creation of a backbone network for cyber-physical production systems. The proposed approach is detailed and discussed with the support of relevant use cases. A number of architectures of support networks based on blockchain technology are proposed, the positive and negative aspects of this approach are considered.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Machine-to-machine communications","Bitcoin","Protocols","Peer-to-peer computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["contracts","cyber-physical systems","machine-to-machine communication","production engineering computing","production equipment","storage management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["smart contracts","machine-to-machine communications","cyber-physical production systems","distributed data storage","information technology","distributed networks","blockchain technology","industrial equipment"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["CPPS","IIoT","M2M","blockchain","Ethereum"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8387630","doi":"10.1109/ICPHYS.2018.8387630","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 IEEE Industrial Cyber-Physical Systems (ICPS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8376183/8387624/08387630.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICPHYS.2018.8387630","startPage":"13","endPage":"19","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8387624","publicationTitle":"2018 IEEE Industrial Cyber-Physical Systems (ICPS)","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An application of blockchain and smart contracts for machine-to-machine communications in cyber-physical production systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"An application of blockchain and smart contracts for machine-to-machine communications in cyber-physical production systems","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8387630/","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"15-18 May 2018","conferenceDate":"15-18 May 2018","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8387630/","dateOfInsertion":"21 June 2018","publicationDate":"May 2018","accessionNumber":"17858605","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An application of blockchain and smart contracts for machine-to-machine communications in cyber-physical production systems","confLoc":"St. Petersburg, Russia","sourcePdf":"0013sf001082.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049597S","chronDate":"15-18 May 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8376183","isNumber":"8387624","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8376183","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"8387624","articleId":"8387630","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8387634,"authors":[{"name":"Stanislav Tomashevich","affiliation":["ITMO University, Saint Petersburg, Russia"],"firstName":"Stanislav","lastName":"Tomashevich","id":"37085369728"},{"name":"Boris Andrievsky","affiliation":["Institute of Problems in Mechanical Engineering of RAS, Saint Petersburg, Russia"],"firstName":"Boris","lastName":"Andrievsky","id":"37326048900"},{"name":"Alexander L.

Modern industrial processes leverage advanced IT technologies to increase productivity and often combine multiple system concepts such as Internet of Things (IoT), Cyber Physical Systems (CPS) and Cloud Computing. Cyber Physical Production Systems (CPPS) are key enablers of this revolution. In CPPS, raw materials, machines, and operations are interconnected to form a sophisticated network. Protecting them against advanced cyber-threats is a priority concern for the future implementation of Industry 4.0 applications. Any impairment of such systems can lead, in fact, to catastrophic damages resulting in a substantial financial loss for governments, companies, as well as endanger the safety of the society. The need for high availability and reliability of these systems is therefore the pillar guiding our research. This paper proposes the adoption of anomaly detection as a method to support self-adaptation in CPPS and to ensure flexibility, reliability, and protection of industrial environments against modern cyber threats. An anomaly detection mechanism can be employed to monitor, and learn the normal behavior of an industrial system, and to generate alerts when the observed events indicate abnormal activities. On this concept we base our work, and we demonstrate how timely identifying critical security events can enable, through the self-adaptation (e.g., triggering automatic configuration changes), an efficient protection of the CPPS against advanced threats, and an effective containment of their effects.","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 IEEE Industrial Cyber-Physical Systems (ICPS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8376183/8387624/08387655.pdf","startPage":"173","endPage":"180","publicationTitle":"2018 IEEE Industrial Cyber-Physical Systems (ICPS)","doi":"10.1109/ICPHYS.2018.8387655","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICPHYS.2018.8387655","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8387624","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8387655","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Protecting cyber physical production systems using anomaly detection to enable self-adaptation","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Security","Monitoring","Anomaly detection","Measurement","Industries","Sensors","Planning"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","cyber-physical systems","Internet of Things","production engineering computing","security of data","self-adjusting systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["anomaly detection mechanism","productivity","IoT","Internet of Things","CPPS self-adaptation","Industry 4.0","cyber physical production systems protection","cloud computing","industrial processes","fourth industrial revolution","financial loss","cyber-threats"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cyber Physical Production Systems","Self-adaptation","Anomaly Detection","Industry 4.0"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8387655/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-18 May 2018","displayDocTitle":"Protecting cyber physical production systems using anomaly detection to enable self-adaptation","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8387655/","publicationDate":"May 2018","accessionNumber":"17858678","dateOfInsertion":"21 June 2018","conferenceDate":"15-18 May 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Protecting cyber physical production systems using anomaly detection to enable self-adaptation","confLoc":"St. Petersburg, Russia","sourcePdf":"0173sf000167.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.102731S","chronDate":"15-18 May 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8376183","isNumber":"8387624","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8376183","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"8387624","articleId":"8387655","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8387662,"authors":[{"name":"Sameeksha Katoch","affiliation":["SenSIP Center, Arizona State University"],"firstName":"Sameeksha","lastName":"Katoch","id":"37086298742"},{"name":"Gowtham Muniraju","affiliation":["SenSIP Center, Arizona State University"],"firstName":"Gowtham","lastName":"Muniraju","id":"37086264910"},{"name":"Sunil Rao","affiliation":["SenSIP Center, Arizona State University"],"firstName":"Sunil","lastName":"Rao","id":"37085818544"},{"name":"Andreas Spanias","affiliation":["SenSIP Center, Arizona State University"],"firstName":"Andreas","lastName":"Spanias","id":"37279657300"},{"name":"Pavan Turaga","affiliation":["SenSIP Center, Arizona State University"],"firstName":"Pavan","lastName":"Turaga","id":"37428672600"},{"name":"Cihan Tepedelenlioglu","affiliation":["SenSIP Center, Arizona State University"],"firstName":"Cihan","lastName":"Tepedelenlioglu","id":"37268523100"},{"name":"Mahesh Banavar","affiliation":["Clarkson University"],"firstName":"Mahesh","lastName":"Banavar","id":"38228384300"},{"name":"Devarajan Srinivasan","affiliation":["Poundra Inc., USA"],"firstName":"Devarajan","lastName":"Srinivasan","id":"37085617476"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-6531-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-6530-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-6532-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8387662","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":12,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":396},"abstract":"This paper describes three methods used in the development of a utility-scale solar cyber-physical system. The study describes remote fault detection using machine learning approaches, power output optimization using cloud movement prediction and consensus-based solar array parameter estimation. Dynamic cloud movement, shading and soiling, lead to fluctuations in power output and loss of efficiency. For optimization of output power, a cloud movement prediction algorithm is proposed. Integrated fault detection methods are also described to predict and by pass failing modules. Finally, the fully connected solar array, which is fitted with multiple sensors, is operated as an Internet of things network. Integrated with each module are sensors and radio electronics communicating all data to a fusion center. Gathering data at the fusion center to compute and transmit analytics requires secure low power communication solutions. To optimize the resources and power consumption, we describe a method to integrate fully distributed algorithms designed for a wireless sensor network in this CPS system.","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 IEEE Industrial Cyber-Physical Systems (ICPS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8376183/8387624/08387662.pdf","startPage":"217","endPage":"222","publicationTitle":"2018 IEEE Industrial Cyber-Physical Systems (ICPS)","doi":"10.1109/ICPHYS.2018.8387662","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICPHYS.2018.8387662","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8387624","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8387662","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Shading prediction, fault detection, and consensus estimation for solar array control","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fault detection","Machine learning algorithms","Arrays","Machine learning","Clouds","Cloud computing","Time series analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","computerised instrumentation","cyber-physical systems","fault diagnosis","Internet","Internet of Things","learning (artificial intelligence)","optimisation","parameter estimation","prediction theory","sensor fusion","solar cell arrays","telecommunication security","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["shading prediction","consensus estimation","solar array control","utility-scale solar cyber-physical system","remote fault detection","machine learning approaches","power output optimization","solar array parameter estimation","integrated fault detection methods","pass failing modules","multiple sensors","radio electronics","fusion center","power consumption","wireless sensor network","CPS system","distributed algorithms","dynamic cloud movement prediction algorithm","low power communication solutions","Internet of Things network"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Solar power analytics","fault detection","shading","IoT Energy","distributed average consensus","PV"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8387662/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-18 May 2018","displayDocTitle":"Shading prediction, fault detection, and consensus estimation for solar array control","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8387662/","publicationDate":"May 2018","accessionNumber":"17858607","dateOfInsertion":"21 June 2018","conferenceDate":"15-18 May 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Shading prediction, fault detection, and consensus estimation for solar array control","confLoc":"St. Petersburg, Russia","sourcePdf":"0217sf002461.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.110069S","chronDate":"15-18 May 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8376183","isNumber":"8387624","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8376183","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"8387624","articleId":"8387662","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8387672,"authors":[{"name":"Fabian Westbrink","affiliation":["Department of Automation Technology, South Westphalia University of Applied Sciences, Soest, Germany"],"firstName":"Fabian","lastName":"Westbrink","id":"37086375035"},{"name":"Gavneet Singh Chadha","affiliation":["Department of Automation Technology, South Westphalia University of Applied Sciences, Soest, Germany"],"firstName":"Gavneet Singh","lastName":"Chadha","id":"37086305275"},{"name":"Andreas Schwung","affiliation":["Department of Automation Technology, South Westphalia University of Applied Sciences, Soest, Germany"],"firstName":"Andreas","lastName":"Schwung","id":"37992265000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-6531-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-6530-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-6532-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8387672","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":133},"abstract":"Condition monitoring and fault detection are of critical importance in modern industrial processes for efficient and productive machine operation.

In this study, we present a novel and rapid fault detection methodology using an integrated Industrial PC. The approach is based on integrating existing hardware components and software libraries for efficient application of machine learning algorithms to an industrial process. The Industrial PC is integrated within the fieldbus system of a Bulk Good Laboratory Plant providing superior network security as compared to an external connection to a cloud platform. Additionally, the Industrial PC provides predominantly better numerical computation functionality as compared to traditional PLC environment due to the availability of machine learning libraries in high-level languages.

generation wireless, has drawn much attention. Since optimal SCMA detection incurs high computational complexity, we develop a modified single tree search (MSTS) to obtain soft outputs for coded SCMA. The MSTS algorithm incorporates the sorting of the channel matrix and computing a non-zero low bound before searching in order to reduce complexity during the search stage. The simulation results show that MSTS not only has lower computational complexity than detectors based on the message passing algorithm (MPA) and repeat tree search but also keeps its performance level close to that of MPA.","doi":"10.1109/LCOMM.2018.2848273","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8432073","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LCOMM.2018.2848273","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/4234/8432073/08387739.pdf","startPage":"1544","endPage":"1547","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Modified Sphere Decoding for Sparse Code Multiple Access","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 June 2018","displayDocTitle":"Modified Sphere Decoding for Sparse Code Multiple Access","volume":"22","issue":"8","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2018","dateOfInsertion":"10 August 2018","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8387739/","publicationDate":"Aug. 2018","accessionNumber":"18007249","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8387739/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"National High Technology Development 863 Program of China","grantNumber":"2015AA01A710"},{"fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities","grantNumber":"21618329"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modified Sphere Decoding for Sparse Code Multiple Access","sourcePdf":"lcomm-li-2848273-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.08204S","chronDate":"Aug.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"4234","isNumber":"8432073","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4234","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"8432073","articleId":"8387739","onlineDate":"18 June 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Letter","lastupdate":"2021-08-21"},{"_id":8387741,"authors":[{"name":"Mostafa Valavi","affiliation":["Electric Power Engineering, Norwegian University of Science and Technology, Trondheim, 7034 Sor-Trondelag, Norway"],"bio":{"p":["Mostafa Valavi (mostafa.valavi@ntnu.no) and Arne Nysveen are with the Norwegian University of Science and Technology, Trondheim, Norway.

However, to achieve the potential benefits of multi-tier C-RANs, it is important to design efficient resource allocation algorithms provided that the data rate of users is guaranteed. Therefore, in this paper, we considered the joint optimization of remote-radio-heads (RRH) association, sub-channel assignment, and power allocation for network sum-rate maximization in single-carrier frequency division multiple access (SC-FDMA)-based multi-tier C-RAN. Due to the exclusivity and adjacency constraints of SC-FDMA, the resource allocation problem becomes harder to solve, thus, the optimal solution is difficult for reasonably sized network. Therefore, we propose an iterative algorithm that solves this non-linear mixed-integer problem in two steps wherein the first step, power allocation and subchannel assignment are carried out, while the second step of the proposed algorithm is concerned with the RRH-association. The iterative algorithm converges to efficient solution. The simulation results verify the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8387765/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 June 2018","chronOrPublicationDate":"2018","volume":"6","accessionNumber":"17905788","dateOfInsertion":"10 July 2018","publicationDate":"2018","htmlLink":"/document/8387765/","isOpenAccess":true,"isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Joint RRH-Association, Sub-Channel Assignment and Power Allocation in Multi-Tier 5G C-Rans","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100010690","fundingName":"American University","grantNumber":"2016-2017"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Joint RRH-Association, Sub-Channel Assignment and Power Allocation in Multi-Tier 5G C-Rans","sourcePdf":"access-ahmad-2847718-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.155454S","chronDate":"2018","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"8274985","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"8274985","articleId":"8387765","onlineDate":"18 June 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8387768,"authors":[{"name":"Foteini Markatopoulou","affiliation":["Centre for Research and Technology Hellas, Information Technologies Institute, Thermi, Greece"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/76/8727555/8387768/marka-2848458-small.gif","p":["Foteini Markatopoulou received the B.Sc. degree in informatics from Aristotle University of Thessaloniki in 2011 and the M.Sc. degree in advanced computing: machine learning and data mining from University of Bristol.

At the first level, we build on ideas from multi-task learning, and propose an approach to learn concept-specific representations that are sparse, linear combinations of representations of latent concepts. By enforcing the sharing of the latent concept representations, we exploit the implicit relations between the target concepts. At a second level, we build on ideas from structured output learning and propose the introduction, at training time, of a new cost term that explicitly models the correlations between the concepts. By doing so, we explicitly model the structure in the output space (i.e., the concept labels). Both of the above are implemented using standard convolutional layers and are incorporated in a single DCNN architecture that can then be trained end-to-end with standard back-propagation. Experiments on four large-scale video and image data sets show that the proposed DCNN improves concept annotation accuracy and outperforms the related state-of-the-art methods.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Implicit and Explicit Concept Relations in Deep Neural Networks for Multi-Label Video/Image Annotation","doi":"10.1109/TCSVT.2018.2848458","startPage":"1631","endPage":"1644","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSVT.2018.2848458","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8727555","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/76/8727555/08387768.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8387768","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 June 2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8387768/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2019","displayDocTitle":"Implicit and Explicit Concept Relations in Deep Neural Networks for Multi-Label Video/Image Annotation","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"29","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/8387768/","dateOfInsertion":"31 May 2019","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"June 2019","accessionNumber":"18726067","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100010669","fundingName":"H2020 LEIT Information and Communication Technologies","grantNumber":"H2020-687786 InVID"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100007065","fundingName":"Nvidia"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Implicit and Explicit Concept Relations in Deep Neural Networks for Multi-Label Video/Image Annotation","sourcePdf":"tcsvt-markatopoulou-2848458-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.126907S","chronDate":"June  2019","xplore-pub-id":"76","isNumber":"8727555","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"76","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"8727555","articleId":"8387768","onlineDate":"18 June 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8387771,"authors":[{"name":"Mahesh Bakshi","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Software Engineering, Concordia University, Montreal, QC, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/8536744/8387771/baksh-2848271-small.gif","p":["Mahesh Bakshi received the bachelor\u2019s degree from Jawaharlal Nehru Technological University, Kakinada, the master\u2019s degree from the University of Hyderabad, and the Ph.D. degree from the Computer Science and Software Engineering Department, Concordia University.

Nearly all previously proposed models only output a set of link transmission configurations, i.e., sets of links that can simultaneously transmit, without providing an ordering of the transmission configurations, nor guaranteeing that such an ordering exists using only the prescribed number of slots. As such, they do not provide a valid schedule to achieve ConvergeCast, and only give a lower bound on the number of slots required for a schedule. In this paper, we propose a first one phase decomposition model and algorithm that outputs a complete and optimum scheduling, i.e., with the output consisting in an ordered sequence of transmission configurations that achieves ConvergeCast. In addition, we show that the resulting transmission graph is not necessarily a tree. The resulting algorithm provides much better schedules, up to 15% less time slots required, than those of the previous best available mathematical programming or heuristic approaches in the literature.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2018.2848271","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2018.2848271","startPage":"5650","endPage":"5661","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/8536744/08387771.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8536744","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimum ConvergeCast Scheduling in Wireless Sensor Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8387771/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2018","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 June 2018","displayDocTitle":"Optimum ConvergeCast Scheduling in Wireless Sensor Networks","volume":"66","issue":"11","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"15 November 2018","accessionNumber":"18247998","publicationDate":"Nov. 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8387771/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Concordia University Research Chair (Tier I) on the Optimization of Communication Networks"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000038","fundingName":"Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimum ConvergeCast Scheduling in Wireless Sensor Networks","sourcePdf":"tcomm-bakshi-2848271-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.11467S","chronDate":"Nov.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"8536744","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"8536744","articleId":"8387771","onlineDate":"18 June 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8387772,"authors":[{"name":"Zhirong Zhang","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Dependable Service Computing in Cyber Physical Society and the School of Automation, Chongqing University, Chongqing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/8556518/8387772/zhang-2844791-small.gif","p":["Zhirong Zhang received the B.S. degree in automation from the School\n of Engineering and Technology, Southwest University, Chongqing, China, in 2016.

Many researchers, vehicle manufacturers, and telecommunication industries are working on VANETS to construct the next generation transport system. In VANETS, vehicles, equipped with wireless devices, exchange the traffic-related information with other vehicles and the fixed road side units (RSUs). The information shared between vehicles and RSUs in VANETS must be secure. For secure communications in VANETS, many cryptographic schemes were proposed in different settings, and most of the schemes are using bilinear pairings over elliptic curves. But the computation of a bilinear pairing is very expensive. Also the verification of signatures/messages sent by vehicles increases the computational workload on RSUs. In order to improve computational efficiency and transmission overhead, in this paper, we present an efficient pairing-free certificateless authentication scheme with batch verification for VANETS. We designed the scheme in pairing-free environment which improves the communication and computational efficiency. The proposed scheme supports batch verification, which significantly reduces the computational workload on RSUs in VANETS. The proposed scheme is proven secure in the random oracle model and meets the security requirements, such as authenticity, integrity, traceability, anonymity, and revocation. We compared our scheme with well-known existing schemes, and the efficiency analysis shows that the proposed scheme is more efficient.","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2845464","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/8274985/08387781.pdf","startPage":"31808","endPage":"31819","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2845464","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8274985","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient Pairing-Free Certificateless Authentication Scheme With Batch Verification for Vehicular Ad-Hoc Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8387781","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 June 2018","chronOrPublicationDate":"2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8387781/","displayDocTitle":"Efficient Pairing-Free Certificateless Authentication Scheme With Batch Verification for Vehicular Ad-Hoc Networks","volume":"6","publicationDate":"2018","accessionNumber":"17905711","isOpenAccess":true,"isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8387781/","dateOfInsertion":"28 June 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Department of Science and Technology, Ministry of Science and Technology, India, through the Women Scientist Scheme","grantNumber":"SR/WOS-A/PM-1033/2014(G)"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Efficient Pairing-Free Certificateless Authentication Scheme With Batch Verification for Vehicular Ad-Hoc Networks","sourcePdf":"access-reddy-2845464-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.111176S","chronDate":"2018","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"8274985","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"8274985","articleId":"8387781","onlineDate":"18 June 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":8387782,"authors":[{"name":"Lu Zhou","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/10206/8410643/8387782/zhou-2848227-small.gif","p":["Lu Zhou received the B.Eng. degree in computer science and technology from Sichuan University, China, in 2015.

The best practice that has been adopted by many insurance programs to protect users' location privacy is the use of driving speed rather than GPS data. However, in this paper, we challenge this approach by presenting a novel speed-based location trajectory inference framework. The basic strategy of the proposed inference framework is motivated by the following observations. In practice, many environmental factors, such as real-time traffic and traffic regulations, can influence the driving speed. These factors provide side-channel information about the driving route, which can be exploited to infer the vehicle's trace. We implement our discovered attack on a public data set in New Jersey. The experimental results show that the attacker has a nearly 60% probability of obtaining the real route if he chooses the top 10 candidate routes. To thwart the proposed attack, we design a privacy preserving scoring and data audition framework that enhances drivers' control on location privacy without affecting the utility of UBI. Our defense framework can also detect users' dishonest behavior (e.g., modification of speed data) via a probabilistic audition scheme. Extensive experimental results validate the effectiveness of the defense framework.","doi":"10.1109/TIFS.2018.2848227","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security","pdfPath":"/iel7/10206/8410643/08387782.pdf","startPage":"196","endPage":"211","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIFS.2018.2848227","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8410643","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Location Privacy in Usage-Based Automotive Insurance: Attacks and Countermeasures","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8387782","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 June 2018","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2019","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8387782/","displayDocTitle":"Location Privacy in Usage-Based Automotive Insurance: Attacks and Countermeasures","volume":"14","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2019","accessionNumber":"17932892","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8387782/","dateOfInsertion":"23 July 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"U1405251, U1401253 and 61672350"},{"fundingName":"JSPS KAKENHI","grantNumber":"JP16K00117 and JP15K15976"},{"fundingName":"KDDI Foundation"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Location Privacy in Usage-Based Automotive Insurance: Attacks and Countermeasures","sourcePdf":"tifs-zhu-2848227-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.110019S","chronDate":"Jan.  2019","xplore-pub-id":"10206","isNumber":"8410643","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10206","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"8410643","articleId":"8387782","onlineDate":"18 June 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8387783,"authors":[{"name":"Roberto Maneiro-Catoira","affiliation":["Department of Computer Engineering, University of A Coru\u00f1a, A Coru\u00f1a, Spain"],"firstName":"Roberto","lastName":"Maneiro-Catoira","id":"37085417007"},{"name":"Julio Br\u00e9gains","affiliation":["Department of Computer Engineering, University of A Coru\u00f1a, A Coru\u00f1a, Spain"],"firstName":"Julio","lastName":"Br\u00e9gains","id":"37270147500"},{"name":"Jos\u00e9 A.

With the development of modern electrophysiology technology, some recent multi-electrode technologies have been able to record the activity of thousands of neuronal spikes simultaneously. In this scenario, however, the recorded activity may be the overlap of multi-neuron spikes, which will degrade the sorting performance of existing cluster-based algorithms. In this paper, we introduce methods for overlapping spike sorting. The introduced methods start from a convolution model, where a sparse vector could be obtained via sparse coding or compressive sensing. Then, we use a maximum a posteriori estimate to optimize the sparse vector, which makes the overlapped spike sorting completed successfully. The advantage of the introduced method is that it performs better than traditional methods when the waveforms of the spikes are similar. In experiments, some synthetic and real spike data are used to testify the methods. The experiment results show that the introduced methods' average sorting detection, defined as the ratio of successfully sorted spikes to the total spikes is nearly 4% higher than the traditional methods, under the condition of the experimental data with similar waveforms.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sparse Coding and Compressive Sensing for Overlapping Neural Spike Sorting","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Systems and Rehabilitation Engineering","doi":"10.1109/TNSRE.2018.2848463","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Systems and Rehabilitation Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel7/7333/8428683/08387789.pdf","startPage":"1516","endPage":"1525","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNSRE.2018.2848463","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8428683","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8387789","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8387789/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 June 2018","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2018","displayDocTitle":"Sparse Coding and Compressive Sensing for Overlapping Neural Spike Sorting","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"26","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/8387789/","dateOfInsertion":"07 August 2018","publicationDate":"Aug. 2018","accessionNumber":"18000746","pubMedId":"29994120","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61762093"},{"fundingName":"17th batches of Young and Middle-aged Leaders in Academic and Technical Reserved Talents Project of Yunnan Province","grantNumber":"2014HB019"},{"fundingName":"Key Applied and Basic Research Foundation of Yunnan Province","grantNumber":"2018FA036"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100007839","fundingName":"Yunnan University"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sparse Coding and Compressive Sensing for Overlapping Neural Spike Sorting","sourcePdf":"tnsre-wu-2848463-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.082871S","chronDate":"Aug.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"7333","isNumber":"8428683","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7333","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"8428683","articleId":"8387789","onlineDate":"18 June 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8387791,"authors":[{"name":"Chun-Rong Huang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, National Chung Hsing University, Taichung, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/83/8396881/8387791/huang-2848548-small.gif","p":["Chun-Rong Huang (M\u201905) received the B.S. and Ph.D. degrees from the Department of Electrical Engineering, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan, in 1999 and 2005, respectively.

To reduce the computational cost of iterative optimization procedures adopted in most recent approaches, the proposed USEAQ for superpixel generation works in a one-pass fashion. It first performs joint spatial and color quantizations and groups pixels into regions. It then takes into account the variations between regions, and adaptively samples one or a few superpixel candidates for each region. It finally employs maximum a posteriori estimation to assign pixels to the most spatially consistent and perceptually similar superpixels. It turns out that the proposed USEAQ is quite efficient, and the extracted superpixels can precisely adhere to boundaries of objects. Experimental results show that USEAQ achieves better or equivalent performance compared with the state-of-the-art superpixel extraction approaches in terms of boundary recall, undersegmentation error, achievable segmentation accuracy, the average miss rate, average undersegmentation error, and average unexplained variation, and it is significantly faster than these approaches.

The magnetic hysteresis of the ferrite core is modeled by the play model to evaluate the hysteresis losses. The multi-objective optimization problems are solved by the genetic algorithm in which the magnetic loss is effectively computed by the trained ANN to reduce the core volume as well as magnetic loss. The Pareto solutions for an EI-shaped ferrite core are obtained for different inductances.

In this paper, we investigate the latency-minimization problem in a multi-user time-division multiple access MECO system with joint communication and computation resource allocation. Three different computation models are studied, i.e., local compression, edge cloud compression, and partial compression offloading. First, closed-form expressions of optimal resource allocation and minimum system delay for both local and edge cloud compression models are derived. Then, for the partial compression offloading model, we formulate a piecewise optimization problem and prove that the optimal data segmentation strategy has a piecewise structure. Based on this result, an optimal joint communication and computation resource allocation algorithm is developed. To gain more insights, we also analyze a specific scenario where communication resource is adequate while computation resource is limited. In this special case, the closed-form solution of the piecewise optimization problem can be derived. Our proposed algorithms are finally verified by numerical results, which show that the novel partial compression offloading model can significantly reduce the end-to-end latency.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8387798/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 June 2018","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2018","volume":"17","issue":"8","accessionNumber":"18007392","dateOfInsertion":"10 August 2018","publicationDate":"Aug. 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8387798/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Latency Optimization for Resource Allocation in Mobile-Edge Computation Offloading","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61671407 and 61471319"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100005320","fundingName":"Xidian University","grantNumber":"ISN18-13"},{"fundingName":"Zhejiang Provincial Key Project of Research and Development","grantNumber":"2017C01024"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Latency Optimization for Resource Allocation in Mobile-Edge Computation Offloading","sourcePdf":"twc-yu-2845360-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.085781S","chronDate":"Aug.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"8432071","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"119","xplore-issue":"8432071","articleId":"8387798","onlineDate":"18 June 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8387804,"authors":[{"name":"Mohammad R.

Subregion method is used to select and isolate the area of interest where design parameters for defect shape are updated. An elastic mesh generator is developed in this paper to generate optimal meshes in the selected area to save connectivity matrix until having the most accurate design parameters. Using subregion FEM in solving inverse problems will help in minimizing processing time and memory usage in addition of reducing solution complexity. A 2-D eddy current testing (ECT) problem of detecting and characterizing the location and shape of a defect by separating the defect from entire domain is used to validate the presented subregion FEM algorithm. The elastic mesh generator is investigated to update the preselected design parameters of the defect in each iteration. This meshing technique adds the specialty of using subregion method in inverse problems where elements and nodes numberings are saved inside and outside the defect region. Both the genetic algorithm and simulated annealing optimization techniques are developed to get the accurate defect parameters. The presented subregion FEM results have been verified computationally using conventional FEM. Excellent results of signals agreement and processing time minimization with a factor of 90% with an accuracy of 98% have been achieved. In addition, the presented subregion FEM algorithm has been verified experimentally using aluminum (T6061-T6) and mild steel plate (0.15%-0.30% carbon and Fe) samples. This experiment is carried using an elongated excitation coil in a fixed position mounted on the top of the sample and tunneling magnetoresistive sensor to measure magnetic field. The measured magnetic fields were used as input to the inverse subregion FEM solver and the machined artificial defects were characterized with excellent accuracy.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimized Solutions for Defect Characterization in 2-D Inverse Eddy Current Testing Problems Using Subregion Finite Element Method","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","doi":"10.1109/TMAG.2018.2840103","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","pdfPath":"/iel7/20/8412622/08387804.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"15","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMAG.2018.2840103","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8412622","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8387804","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8387804/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 June 2018","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2018","displayDocTitle":"Optimized Solutions for Defect Characterization in 2-D Inverse Eddy Current Testing Problems Using Subregion Finite Element Method","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"54","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/8387804/","dateOfInsertion":"18 July 2018","externalId":"6201515","publicationDate":"Aug. 2018","accessionNumber":"17935199","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimized Solutions for Defect Characterization in 2-D Inverse Eddy Current Testing Problems Using Subregion Finite Element Method","sourcePdf":"tmag-deng-2840103-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.107683S","chronDate":"Aug.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"20","isNumber":"8412622","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"20","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8412622","articleId":"8387804","onlineDate":"18 June 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8387808,"authors":[{"name":"Xi Peng","affiliation":["College of Computer Science, Sichuan University, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Xi","lastName":"Peng","orcid":"0000-0002-5727-2790","id":"37075704400"},{"name":"Jiashi Feng","affiliation":["Department of ECE, National University of Singapore, Singapore"],"firstName":"Jiashi","lastName":"Feng","id":"37956942000"},{"name":"Shijie Xiao","affiliation":["3OmniVision Technologies Singapore Pte.

However, due to the limited representative capacity of the employed shallow models, those methods may fail in handling realistic data without the linear subspace structure. To address this issue, we propose a novel subspace clustering approach by introducing a new deep model - Structured AutoEncoder (StructAE). The StructAE learns a set of explicit transformations to progressively map input data points into nonlinear latent spaces while preserving the local and global subspace structure. In particular, to preserve local structure, the StructAE learns representations for each data point by minimizing reconstruction error with respect to itself. To preserve global structure, the StructAE incorporates a prior structured information by encouraging the learned representation to preserve specified reconstruction patterns over the entire data set. To the best of our knowledge, StructAE is one of the first deep subspace clustering approaches. Extensive experiments show that the proposed StructAE significantly outperforms 15 state-of-the-art subspace clustering approaches in terms of five evaluation metrics.","doi":"10.1109/TIP.2018.2848470","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image

the performance of a multi-class brain-computer interface (BCI). The BCI system is based on the concept of somatosensory attentional orientation (SAO), in which the user shifts and maintains somatosensory attention by imagining the sensation of tactile stimulation of a body part. At the beginning of every trial, a vibration stimulus (200 ms) informed the subjects to prepare for the task. Four SAO tasks were performed following randomly presented cues: SAO of the left hand (SAO-LF), SAO of the right hand (SAO-RT), bilateral SAO (SAO-BI), and SAO suppressed or idle state (SAO-ID). Analysis of the event-related desynchronization and synchronization (ERD/ERS) in the EEG indicated that the four SAO tasks had different somatosensory cortical activation patterns. SAO-LF and SAO-RT exhibited stronger contralateral ERD, whereas bilateral ERD activation was indicative of SAO-BI, and bilateral ERS activation was associated with SAO-ID. By selecting the frequency bands and/or optimal classes, classification accuracy of the system reached 85.2%\u00b111.2% for two classes, 69.5%\u00b116.2% for three classes, and 55.9%\u00b115.8% for four classes. The results validated a multi-class BCI system based on SAO, on a single trial basis. Somatosensory attention to different body parts induces diverse oscillatory dynamics within the somatosensory area of the brain, and the proposed SAO paradigm provided a new approach for a multiple-class BCI that is potentially stimulus independent.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Multi-Class BCI Based on Somatosensory Imagery","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Systems and Rehabilitation Engineering","doi":"10.1109/TNSRE.2018.2848883","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Systems and Rehabilitation Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel7/7333/8428683/08387815.pdf","startPage":"1508","endPage":"1515","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNSRE.2018.2848883","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8428683","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8387815","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8387815/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 June 2018","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2018","displayDocTitle":"A Multi-Class BCI Based on Somatosensory Imagery","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"26","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/8387815/","dateOfInsertion":"07 August 2018","publicationDate":"Aug. 2018","accessionNumber":"18000752","pubMedId":"29994123","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003400","fundingName":"Ministry of Research, Innovation and Science","grantNumber":"ER17-13-183"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Multi-Class BCI Based on Somatosensory Imagery","sourcePdf":"tnsre-jiang-2848883-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.138339S","chronDate":"Aug.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"7333","isNumber":"8428683","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7333","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"8428683","articleId":"8387815","onlineDate":"18 June 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8387816,"authors":[{"name":"Xuanxuan Tang","affiliation":["Department of Informatics, King\u2019s College London, London, U.K."],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/10206/8410643/8387816/tang-2848630-small.gif","p":["Xuanxuan Tang received the B.S. degree in communication engineering from the College of Communications Engineering, PLA University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, China, in 2014.

The maximal ratio transmission protocol is applied at the multi-antenna source such that the wireless signals are designated to the destination directly. Besides, the energy harvesting and full-duplex self-jamming operations are adopted at the energy-constrained destination to prolong its lifetime as well as to confuse the eavesdropper. Specifically, the exact and asymptotic closed-form expressions of the connection outage probability (COP), the secrecy outage probability (SOP), and the secrecy throughput of the proposed system are obtained, based on which we optimize the time-switching ratio to maximize the secrecy throughput. We also degenerate the proposed SWIPT-FDSJ scheme to the reduced half-duplex with no self-jamming (HDNSJ) scheme. The finds suggest that in the HDNSJ scheme, adding the antenna number of the source only benefits the COP performance, but has no impact on the SOP performance. By contrast, it will promote the COP and SOP performance at the same time in the SWIPT-FDSJ scheme, which eventually results in the great improvement of secrecy throughput. In addition, we present the practical application condition of the SWIPT-FDSJ scheme. It is demonstrated that the secrecy throughput performance of the SWIPT-FDSJ scheme is much superior to the HDNSJ scheme on condition that the application condition is satisfied.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIFS.2018.2848630","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8410643","startPage":"212","endPage":"222","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security","pdfPath":"/iel7/10206/8410643/08387816.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Energy-Constrained SWIPT Networks: Enhancing Physical Layer Security With FD Self-Jamming","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8387816/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2019","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 June 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8387816/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Energy-Constrained SWIPT Networks: Enhancing Physical Layer Security With FD Self-Jamming","publicationDate":"Jan. 2019","accessionNumber":"17932890","dateOfInsertion":"23 July 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"14","issue":"1","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61771487, 61471393, 61501507 and 61371122"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004608","fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province","grantNumber":"BK20150719"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004543","fundingName":"China Scholarship Council"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy-Constrained SWIPT Networks: Enhancing Physical Layer Security With FD Self-Jamming","sourcePdf":"tifs-yueming-2848630-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.136907S","chronDate":"Jan.  2019","xplore-pub-id":"10206","isNumber":"8410643","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10206","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"8410643","articleId":"8387816","onlineDate":"18 June 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8387819,"authors":[{"name":"Mian Xiang","affiliation":["Department of School of Electronic Information, Wuhan University, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Mian","lastName":"Xiang","orcid":"0000-0002-1632-2923","id":"37086275004"},{"name":"Benshun Yi","affiliation":["Shenzhen Institute of Wuhan University, Shenzhen, China"],"firstName":"Benshun","lastName":"Yi","id":"37085392633"},{"name":"Kang Qiu","affiliation":["Department of School of Electronic Information, Wuhan University, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Kang","lastName":"Qiu","id":"37086281705"},{"name":"Taiqi Huang","affiliation":["28th Research Institute of China Electronics Technology Group Corporation, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Taiqi","lastName":"Huang","id":"37086452144"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-7798"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2558"},{"format":"CD","value":"2373-7891"}],"articleNumber":"8387819","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":201},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Lips","Decoding","Encoding","Transmitters","Network coding","Throughput","Receivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decoding","probability","tree codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["asymptotic decoding probabilities","FEW-BATS code","feedback expanding-window BATS code"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["BATS code","unequal error protection","And-Or tree analysis","feedback"]}],"abstract":"In this letter, we investigate feedback in expanding window BATS (EW-BATS) code.

Our design aims to form shaped beams with high spatial isolation. We first study the beam shaping feasibility in mm-wave communications with reduced transmit antenna element spacing. We then introduce active scatters, a class of active devices that stimulates scattering effect, to sustain the interference rejection capability of shaped beams. The composition of active scatters forms a (virtual) noncontiguous aperture that is larger than transmit and receive antennas in size. To form multiple orthogonal beam (OB) radiation patterns that have peaks and nulls at designated locations, which enable frequency reuse, we consider slightly increased aperture size of transmit antenna and noncontiguous aperture that is comprised of active scatters. In addition to beamforming via noncontiguous aperture, we also simulated QPSK-modulated signal streams transmitted via OBs and justified the simulated system by inspecting the bit error rate performance at the receiver.","doi":"10.1109/JSYST.2018.2841404","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Systems Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/4267003/8543256/08387829.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8543256","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSYST.2018.2841404","publicationTitle":"IEEE Systems Journal","startPage":"3889","endPage":"3892","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Study of mm-Wave Communications With Noncontiguous Aperture","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8387829","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2018","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 June 2018","displayDocTitle":"A Study of mm-Wave Communications With Noncontiguous Aperture","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8387829/","volume":"12","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/8387829/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2018","accessionNumber":"18281190","dateOfInsertion":"22 November 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Spatial Digital Systems and in part by California State University of Long Beach"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Study of mm-Wave Communications With Noncontiguous Aperture","sourcePdf":"jsyst-lee-2841404-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.043115S","chronDate":"Dec.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"4267003","isNumber":"8543256","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4267003","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"8543256","articleId":"8387829","onlineDate":"18 June 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8387833,"authors":[{"name":"Sindri Magn\u00fasson","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, Sweden"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4200690/8423790/8387833/magnu-2848718-small.gif","p":["Sindri Magn\u00fasson received the B.Sc. degree in mathematics from\n the University of Iceland, Reykjav\u00edk, Iceland, in 2011, and the Master's degree in mathematics and Ph.D.\n degree in electrical engineering from the KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, Sweden, in 2013 and 2017,\n respectively.

The first measure is \u20ac-complexity, which quantifies the minimal number of bits needed to find an \u20ac-accurate solution. The second measure is b-complexity, which quantifies the best possible solution accuracy that can be achieved from communicating b bits. We find the exact \u20acand b-complexity of a class of resource allocation problems where a single supplier allocates resources to multiple users. For both the primal and dual problems, the \u20ac-complexity grows proportionally to log2 (1/\u20ac) and the b-complexity proportionally to 1/2\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">b</sup>\n. We also introduce a variant of the \u20ac- and b-complexity measures where only algorithms that ensure primal feasibility of the iterates are allowed. Such algorithms are often desirable because overuse of the resources can overload the respective systems, e.g., by causing blackouts in power systems. We provide upper and lower bounds on the convergence rate of these primal feasible complexity measures. In particular, we show that the b-complexity cannot converge at a faster rate than O(1/b). Therefore, the results demonstrate a tradeoff between fast convergence and primal feasibility. We illustrate the result by numerical studies.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/4200690/8423790/08387833.pdf","startPage":"717","endPage":"732","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/JSTSP.2018.2848718","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSTSP.2018.2848718","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8423790","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8387833","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Communication Complexity of Dual Decomposition Methods for Distributed Resource Allocation Optimization","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Complexity theory","Resource management","Signal processing algorithms","Optimization","Bandwidth","Convergence","Communication networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["communication complexity","convergence","Internet of Things","optimisation","resource allocation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["\u20ac-complexity","b-complexity measures","primal feasible complexity measures","communication complexity","dual decomposition methods","distributed resource allocation optimization","primal/dual saddle point solutions","resource allocation optimization problems","communication overhead","convergence rate","Internet of Things networks"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Distributed optimization","networked systems","resource allocation","communication complexity"]}],"chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/4200690/8423790/8387833-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8387833/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2018","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 June 2018","displayDocTitle":"Communication Complexity of Dual Decomposition Methods for Distributed Resource Allocation Optimization","volume":"12","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/8387833/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2018","accessionNumber":"17973410","dateOfInsertion":"01 August 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"VR Chromos Project"},{"fundingName":"NSF","grantNumber":"1548204 and 1608509"},{"fundingName":"NSF CAREER","grantNumber":"1553407, AFOSR YIP and ARPA-E"},{"fundingName":"NODES"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","chorusFlag":"true","title":"Communication Complexity of Dual Decomposition Methods for Distributed Resource Allocation Optimization","sourcePdf":"jstsp-magnusson-2848718-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.139839S","chronDate":"Aug.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"4200690","isNumber":"8423790","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4200690","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"8423790","articleId":"8387833","onlineDate":"18 June 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8387836,"authors":[{"name":"Junfeng Liu","affiliation":["School of Automation Science and Engineering, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6245517/8428688/8387836/liu-2848675-small.gif","p":["Junfeng Liu received the M.S. degree in control engineering from the South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, China, in 2005, and the Ph.D. degree from The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hong Kong, in 2013.","From 2005 to 2008, he was a Development Engineer of the Guangdong Nortel Network, Guangzhou.

The switching frequency, as well as the switching loss, is hence increased, and the topologies are limited to low-frequency output occasions as a result. In switched-capacitor MLIs (SCMLIs), the capacitors are self-balanced, since they are charged to fixed voltage levels by the input source directly or indirectly. By integrating switched-capacitor techniques into conventional hybrid MLIs, a pair of symmetric/asymmetric hybrid MLIs is proposed in this paper with boost ability. Complicated balance controls are avoided for capacitor voltages, and thus the modulation gets simplified. Compared with SCMLIs, the backend H-bridges that withstand the accumulated voltage stress are removed. The peak inverse voltages of devices are decreased, and thus only low-voltage components are needed. Meanwhile, the component numbers are reduced greatly. All these advantages contribute to high efficiency and reduced costs. Consequently, the proposed hybrid MLIs are especially appropriate for synthesizing a staircase output directly from an input source of low voltage. Analyses and their operational principles are firstly presented for the proposed topologies. Comparisons are then carried out to illustrate their superiority. To evaluate the performance, simulation and experimental prototypes are implemented, whose results confirm the feasibility of the proposed hybrid MLIs.","doi":"10.1109/JESTPE.2018.2848675","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Emerging and Selected Topics in Power Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Emerging and Selected Topics in Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/6245517/8428688/08387836.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JESTPE.2018.2848675","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8428688","startPage":"1616","endPage":"1626","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Symmetric/Asymmetric Hybrid Multilevel Inverters Integrating Switched-Capacitor Techniques","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8387836","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Symmetric/Asymmetric Hybrid Multilevel Inverters Integrating Switched-Capacitor Techniques","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8387836/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 June 2018","isJournal":true,"volume":"6","issue":"3","publicationDate":"Sept. 2018","accessionNumber":"17991193","dateOfInsertion":"07 August 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8387836/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61573155"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003453","fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province","grantNumber":"2016A03031358"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100007162","fundingName":"Guangdong Science and Technology Department","grantNumber":"2016A010102007"},{"fundingName":"Science and Technology Program of Guangzhou","grantNumber":"201607010209"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Symmetric/Asymmetric Hybrid Multilevel Inverters Integrating Switched-Capacitor Techniques","sourcePdf":"jestpe-zeng-2848675-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.081553S","chronDate":"Sept.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"6245517","isNumber":"8428688","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6245517","citationCount":"36","xplore-issue":"8428688","articleId":"8387836","onlineDate":"18 June 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8387844,"authors":[{"name":"Jin-E Zhang","affiliation":["Hubei Normal University, Huangshi, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/8274985/8387844/zhang-2848629-small.gif","p":["Jin-E Zhang is currently an Assistant Professor with Hubei Normal University, Huangshi, Hubei, China.

Based on this, a novel augmented sample covariance matrix method is proposed, which enhances the spatial degrees of freedom and increases the number of identifiable sources.

network-connected unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) communications. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have found fast growing applications in recent years, such as for cargo delivery, precision agriculture, aerial monitoring, video streaming, traffic control, rescue and search, and communication relaying. As the number of UAVs and their related applications grow explosively in the coming years, it is imperative to develop high-performance wireless communication technologies, not only for supporting the ultra-reliable UAV remote command and control (C&C) to ensure their safe operations, but also for enabling high-capacity mission-related information transmission for rate-demanding applications. Integrating UAVs into cellular and satellite networks is a promising solution to achieve the above goals, where UAVs with their own missions could be connected with either cellular base stations (BSs) or satellites as special aerial users, referred to as network-connected UAVs.","doi":"10.1109/CC.2018.8387981","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CC.2018.8387981","startPage":"iii","endPage":"v","publicationTitle":"China Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"China Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/6245522/8387978/08387981.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8387978","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Network-connected UAV communications","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8387981/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2018","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 June 2018","displayDocTitle":"Network-connected UAV communications","volume":"15","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"19 June 2018","publicationDate":"May 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Network-connected UAV communications","sourcePdf":"GUESTEDITORIAL201805.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.022524S","chronDate":"May  2018","isNumber":"8387978","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6245522","citationCount":"1","articleId":"8387981","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8387982,"authors":[{"name":"Ting Qi","affiliation":["Tsinghua University, Beijing, Beijing, CN"],"firstName":"Ting","lastName":"Qi"},{"name":"Wei Feng","affiliation":["Tsinghua University, Beijing, Beijing, CN"],"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Feng"},{"name":"Youzheng Wang","affiliation":["Tsinghua University, Beijing, Beijing, CN"],"firstName":"Youzheng","lastName":"Wang"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1673-5447"}],"articleNumber":"8387982","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":28,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":603},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Satellites","NOMA","Probability","Power system reliability","Satellite broadcasting","Resource management","Rain"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["autonomous aerial vehicles","cooperative communication","fading","mobile communication","multi-access systems","radio spectrum management","satellite communication","telecommunication network reliability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["nonorthogonal multiple access","unmanned aerial vehicles satellite networks","UAVs access satellite networks","spectral efficiency","satellite network","outage performance analysis","rain fading"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA)","outage performance","power allocation","satellite networks","unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)"]}],"abstract":"With rapid development of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), more and more UAVs access satellite networks for data transmission.

Compared with conventional static relaying, mobile relaying provides more degree of freedom for experiencing better channel conditions and further improving the system reliable performance. The source and relay transmit power as well as relay trajectory are jointly optimized for sum outage probability minimization in mobile relaying system. Due to the non-convex nature of the original problem, block coordinate decent optimization techniques are employed to decompose it into two sub-problems, which leads to an efficient iterative algorithm. Specifically, for the pre-determined relay trajectory, the optimal transmit power of source and relay are obtained by solving Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions. For the given source/relay power allocation, the optimal UAV trajectory is obtained by solving dual problem.

Most related works do not consider cumulative inter-cell interference when studying the coverage performance of DSCs. First, we derive an approximate and closed-form expression of the cumulative inter-cell interference which comes from both probabilistic Line-of-Sight (LoS) and Non-Line-of-Sight (NLoS) links.

This paper is concerned with the UAV's trajectory planning problem for secrecy energy efficiency maximization (SEEM) in the UAV communication system. Specifically, we jointly consider the secrecy throughput and UAV's energy consumption in a three-node (fixed-wing UAV-aided source, destination, and eavesdropper) wiretap channel. By ignoring the energy consumption on radiation and signal processing, the system's secrecy energy efficiency is defined as the total secrecy rate normalized by the UAV's propulsion energy consumption within a given time horizon. Nonetheless, the SEEM problem is nonconvex and thus is intractable to solve. As a compromise, we propose an iterative algorithm based on sequential convex programming (SCP) and Dinkel-bach's method to seek a suboptimal solution for SEEM. The algorithm only needs to solve convex problems, and thus is computationally efficient to implement. Additionally, we prove that the proposed algorithm has Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) point convergence guarantee. Lastly, simulation results demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed algorithm in improving the secrecy energy efficiency for the UAV communication system.","doi":"10.1109/CC.2018.8387986","publicationTitle":"China Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"China Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/6245522/8387978/08387986.pdf","startPage":"51","endPage":"60","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8387978","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CC.2018.8387986","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Energy-efficient trajectory planning for UAV-aided secure communication","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8387986","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2018","displayDocTitle":"Energy-efficient trajectory planning for UAV-aided secure communication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8387986/","publicationDate":"May 2018","dateOfInsertion":"19 June 2018","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"17857709","volume":"15","issue":"5","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 June 2018","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy-efficient trajectory planning for UAV-aided secure communication","sourcePdf":"5.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.025903S","chronDate":"May  2018","isNumber":"8387978","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6245522","citationCount":"9","articleId":"8387986","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8387987,"authors":[{"name":"Liquan Chen","affiliation":["Southeast University, Nanjing, Jiangsu, CN"],"firstName":"Liquan","lastName":"Chen"},{"name":"Sijie Qian","affiliation":["Southeast University, Nanjing, Jiangsu, CN"],"firstName":"Sijie","lastName":"Qian"},{"name":"Ming Lim","affiliation":["Coventry University, Coventry, West Midlands, GB"],"firstName":"Ming","lastName":"Lim"},{"name":"Shihui Wang","affiliation":["Southeast University, Nanjing, Jiangsu, CN"],"firstName":"Shihui","lastName":"Wang"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1673-5447"}],"articleNumber":"8387987","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":297},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8387987","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Authentication","Communication systems","Privacy","Unmanned aerial vehicles","Satellites","Gold"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["autonomous aerial vehicles","cryptography","mobile communication","telecommunication security"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["enhanced direct anonymous attestation scheme","mutual authentication","network-connected UAV communication systems","user authentication","platform identity authentication","integrity check","attractive cryptographic scheme","platform authentication","anonymity","NC-UAV communication systems","enhanced DAA scheme","MA-DAA scheme"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["network-connected UAV","trusted computing","direct anonymous attestation","mutual authentication","trusted platform module"]}],"abstract":"In network-connected UAV (NC-UAV) communication systems, user authentication is replaced by platform identity authentication and integrity check because many NC-UAVs are operated without human intervention. Direct anonymous attestation (DAA) is an attractive cryptographic scheme that provides an elegant balance between platform authentication and anonymity. However, because of the low-level computing capability and limited transmission bandwidth in UAV, the existing DAA schemes are not suitable for NC-UAV communication systems. In this paper, we propose an enhanced DAA scheme with mutual authentication (MA-DAA scheme), which meets the security requirements of NC-UAV communication systems. The proposed MA-DAA scheme, which is based on asymmetric pairings, bundles the identities of trusted platform module (TPM) and Host to solve the malicious module changing attacks. Credential randomization, batch proof and verification, and mutual authentication are realized in the MA-DAA scheme.

To construct network service function chains in such a multi-domain environment, we propose a horizontal-based Multi-domain Service Function Chaining (Md-SFC) orchestration framework. In this framework, multi-domain orchestrators can coordinate with each other to guarantee the end-to-end service quality. Intra-domain orchestrators also coordinate SDN controllers and NFV management components to implement intra-domain service function chains. Based on this, we further propose a heuristic SFC mapping algorithm with a cooperative inter-domain path calculation method to map service function chains to infrastructures. In this method, master multi-domain orchestrator and intra-domain orchestrators coordinate to select proper inter-domain links. We compare the cooperative method with a naive uncooperative way that domains' topology information is provided to the master multi-domain orchestrator and it calculates the shortest inter-domain path between intra-domain service function chains directly. Simulation results demonstrate that our solution is feasible. It is able to construct end-to-end performance guaranteed service function chain by horizontal-based cooperation. The cooperative inter-domain path calculation method decreases the mapping load for the master orchestrator and gets the same end-to-end performance.","doi":"10.1109/CC.2018.8387988","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CC.2018.8387988","startPage":"77","endPage":"91","publicationTitle":"China Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"China Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/6245522/8387978/08387988.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8387978","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Horizontal-based orchestration for multi-domain SFC in SDN/NFV-enabled satellite/terrestrial networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8387988/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2018","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 June 2018","displayDocTitle":"Horizontal-based orchestration for multi-domain SFC in SDN/NFV-enabled satellite/terrestrial networks","volume":"15","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"19 June 2018","accessionNumber":"17857701","publicationDate":"May 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Horizontal-based orchestration for multi-domain SFC in SDN/NFV-enabled satellite/terrestrial networks","sourcePdf":"7.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.039051S","chronDate":"May  2018","isNumber":"8387978","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6245522","citationCount":"3","articleId":"8387988","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8387989,"authors":[{"name":"Wei Chen","affiliation":["Wuhan University, Wuhan, Hubei, CN"],"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Chen"},{"name":"Ruimin Hu","affiliation":["Wuhan University, Wuhan, Hubei, CN"],"firstName":"Ruimin","lastName":"Hu"},{"name":"Xiaochen Wang","affiliation":["Wuhan University, Wuhan, Hubei, CN"],"firstName":"Xiaochen","lastName":"Wang"},{"name":"Cheng Yang","affiliation":["Wuhan University, Wuhan, Hubei, CN"],"firstName":"Cheng","lastName":"Yang"},{"name":"Lian Meng","affiliation":["Wuhan University, Wuhan, Hubei, CN"],"firstName":"Lian","lastName":"Meng"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1673-5447"}],"articleNumber":"8387989","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":37},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8387989","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Databases","Torso","Ear","Azimuth","Correlation","Solid modeling","Measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["anthropometry","human computer interaction","regression analysis","transfer functions","transient response","virtual reality"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["head related impulse responses","anthropometric measurements","individualized customization technology","individualized HRIRs","nonindividualized HRIRs","division analysis","virtual reality","regression analysis","acoustic localization sense"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["HRIR","Individualization","Division analysis"]}],"abstract":"For Virtual Reality (VR) to be truly immersive, it needs convincing sound to match.

The antenna is fabricated and tested. Its measured common -10 dB impedance bandwidth at two ports is 280 MHz (2.32-2.6 GHz) with isolation better than 41 dB. Its MIMO performance in terms of capacity gain (CG) over the SISO system is investigated in a multipath rich environment containing two parallel PEC planes by both measurements and image theory based simulations. Results show that, in free space, the CG results are just slightly larger than 1, however, in the multipath rich channel, the CG values are very close to 2, which indicates that two separate subchannels can be achieved by the proposed CCEMD.

We propose two guaranteed rendezvous algorithms for cognitive radio networks under both single-radio and multi-radio scenarios with an asynchronous setting. For single-radio scenario, each cycle length is a prime number associated with a channel hopping sequence. The rendezvous can be guaranteed as long as the IDs of the two nodes are different. For multi-radio scenario, we propose a cycle length and rotation based rendezvous algorithm. Each node generates a channel hopping sequence with only one cycle length. Then these radios of each nodes rotate on the generated sequence with different rotation numbers at each hopping cycle. The rendezvous between two nodes is guaranteed as long as they have different cycle lengths or the same cycle length with different number of rotations.

The detective performance of SS will be obviously affected by fading channels among communication nodes, and ED has the advantages of fast implementation, no requirement of priori received information and low complexity, so it is meaningful to investigate ED over various fading channels. The probability density function (p.d.f.) of \u03b1-\u03ba-\u03bc distribution is derived to evaluate energy efficiency for sensing systems. The detection probability with Marcum-Q function has been derived and the close-form expressions with moment generating function (MGF) method are deduced to achieve SS. Furthermore, exact closed-form analytic expressions for average area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC) also have been deduced to analyze the performance characteristics of ED over \u03b1-\u03ba-\u03bc fading channels. Besides, cooperative spectrum sensing (CSS) with diversity reception has been applied to improve the detection accuracy and mitigate the shadowed fading features with OR-rule. At last, the results show that the detection capacity of ED will be evidently affected by \u03b1-\u03ba-\u03bc fading channels, but appropriate channel parameters can improve sensing performance.

By abstracting different modes from TCP/IP network and SDN technology, we argue that the centric-distributed-centric (CDC) mode has great potential for the well-defined future network architecture in which diverse network architectures could be incrementally deployed and coexist with each other.

Experimental results reveal that CDC can support diverse architectures to coexist in the current Internet and thus enables the Internet to evolve.","doi":"10.1109/CC.2018.8387994","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CC.2018.8387994","startPage":"149","endPage":"161","publicationTitle":"China Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"China Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/6245522/8387978/08387994.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8387978","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Towards incremental deployment of diverse network architectures on the Internet","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8387994/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2018","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 June 2018","displayDocTitle":"Towards incremental deployment of diverse network architectures on the Internet","volume":"15","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"19 June 2018","accessionNumber":"17857699","publicationDate":"May 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Towards incremental deployment of diverse network architectures on the Internet","sourcePdf":"13.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.047493S","chronDate":"May  2018","isNumber":"8387978","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6245522","articleId":"8387994","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":8387995,"authors":[{"name":"Yanan Cao","affiliation":["Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, Beijing, CN"],"firstName":"Yanan","lastName":"Cao"},{"name":"Muqing Wu","affiliation":["Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, Beijing, CN"],"firstName":"Muqing","lastName":"Wu"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1673-5447"}],"articleNumber":"8387995","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":54},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Routing","Linear programming","Routing protocols","Delays","Fuses","Additives"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fuzzy logic","routing protocols","smart meters","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["RPL","triangle module operator","AMI networks","advanced metering infrastructure","smart meters","city utilities","routing metrics","IAR-TMO","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["routing protocol","RPL","triangle module operator","membership function","objective function"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8387995","displayPublicationTitle":"China Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/6245522/8387978/08387995.pdf","startPage":"162","endPage":"172","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CC.2018.8387995","doi":"10.1109/CC.2018.8387995","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8387978","publicationTitle":"China Communications","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"RPL based on triangle module operator for AMI networks","abstract":"The routing protocol for low-power and lossy networks (RPL) has been used in advanced metering infrastructure (AMI) which could provide two-way communication between smart meters and city utilities.

IAR-TMO proposes membership functions of the following five typical routing metrics: end-to-end delay, number of hops, expected transmission count (ETX), node remaining energy, and child node count. Moreover, IAR-TMO uses triangle module operator to fuse membership functions of these routing metrics. Then, IAR-TMO selects preferred parents (the next hop) based on the triangle module operator. Theoretical analysis and simulation results show that IAR-TMO has a great improvement when compared with two recent representative algorithms: ETXOF (ETX Objective Function) and OF-FL (Objective Function based on Fuzzy Logic), in terms of network lifetime, average end-to-end delay, etc. Consequently, the network performances of AMI networks can be improved effectively.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8387995/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 June 2018","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2018","volume":"15","issue":"5","accessionNumber":"17857706","dateOfInsertion":"19 June 2018","publicationDate":"May 2018","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"RPL based on triangle module operator for AMI networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"RPL based on triangle module operator for AMI networks","sourcePdf":"14.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.035513S","chronDate":"May  2018","isNumber":"8387978","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6245522","articleId":"8387995","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-08-21"},{"_id":8387996,"authors":[{"name":"Hua Wei","affiliation":["Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, Beijing, CN"],"firstName":"Hua","lastName":"Wei"},{"name":"Chun Shan","affiliation":["Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, Beijing, CN"],"firstName":"Chun","lastName":"Shan"},{"name":"Changzhen Hu","affiliation":["Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, Beijing, CN"],"firstName":"Changzhen","lastName":"Hu"},{"name":"Huizhong Sun","affiliation":["Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, Beijing, CN"],"firstName":"Huizhong","lastName":"Sun"},{"name":"Min Lei","affiliation":["Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, Beijing, CN"],"firstName":"Min","lastName":"Lei"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1673-5447"}],"articleNumber":"8387996","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":99},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Software","Prediction algorithms","Software algorithms","Predictive models","Support vector machines","Machine learning","Matrix decomposition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["pattern classification","software engineering","support vector machines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["NPE-SVM","software defect distribution prediction model","NPE algorithm","LLE-SVM prediction algorithm","data redundancy","neighborhood preserving embedded support vector machine","classifier","local geometric data structure","dimensionality reduction","data loss","F-measure"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["data redundancy","SVM","NPE algorithm","dimensionality reduction"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8387996","displayPublicationTitle":"China Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/6245522/8387978/08387996.pdf","startPage":"173","endPage":"182","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CC.2018.8387996","doi":"10.1109/CC.2018.8387996","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8387978","publicationTitle":"China Communications","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Software defect distribution prediction model based on NPE-SVM","abstract":"During the prediction of software defect distribution, the data redundancy caused by the multi-dimensional measurement will lead to the decrease of prediction accuracy.

However it requires large-scale matrix computation with tremendous complexity, especially for data detection and precoding. Recently, many detection and precoding methods were proposed using approximate iteration methods, which meet the demand of precision with low complexity. In this paper, we compare these approximate iteration methods in precision and complexity, and then improve these methods with iteration refinement at the cost of little complexity and no extra hardware resource. By derivation, our proposal is a combination of three approximate iteration methods in essence and provides remarkable precision improvement on desired vectors. The results show that our proposal provides 27%-83% normalized mean-squared error improvement of the detection symbol vector and precoding symbol vector. Moreover, we find the bit-error rate is mainly controlled by soft-input soft-output Viterbi decoding when using approximate iteration methods. Further, only considering the effect on soft-input soft-output Viterbi decoding, the simulation results show that using a rough estimation for the filter matrix of minimum mean square error detection to calculating log-likelihood ratio could provide enough good bit-error rate performance, especially when the ratio of base station antennas number and the users number is not too large.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8387997/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 June 2018","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2018","volume":"15","issue":"5","accessionNumber":"17857710","dateOfInsertion":"19 June 2018","publicationDate":"May 2018","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Approximate iteration detection and precoding in massive MIMO","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Approximate iteration detection and precoding in massive MIMO","sourcePdf":"16.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.028317S","chronDate":"May  2018","isNumber":"8387978","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6245522","citationCount":"6","articleId":"8387997","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":8387998,"authors":[{"name":"Juan Wei","affiliation":["Xidian University, Xian, Shaanxi, CN"],"firstName":"Juan","lastName":"Wei"},{"name":"Fengli Yue","affiliation":["Xidian University, Xian, Shaanxi, CN"],"firstName":"Fengli","lastName":"Yue"},{"name":"Runyu Li","affiliation":["Xidian University, Xian, Shaanxi, CN"],"firstName":"Runyu","lastName":"Li"},{"name":"Wenjing Wang","affiliation":["Xidian University, Xian, Shaanxi, CN"],"firstName":"Wenjing","lastName":"Wang"},{"name":"Dan Gao","affiliation":["Xidian University, Xian, Shaanxi, CN"],"firstName":"Dan","lastName":"Gao"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1673-5447"}],"articleNumber":"8387998","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":100},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wideband","Direction-of-arrival estimation","Estimation","Particle filters","Compressed sensing","Radar tracking","Array signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["acoustic arrays","acoustic generators","acoustic radiators","acoustic signal processing","approximation theory","array signal processing","compressed sensing","direction-of-arrival estimation","particle filtering (numerical methods)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["particle filter","compressive sensing method","acoustic array signal processing","signal sparsity representation","wideband DOA estimation","wideband CS algorithms","kernel density estimator","random linear array","direction of arrival estimation","moving wideband sound source tracking","uniform linear array"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["direction of arrival","tracking","compressive sensing","particle filter","wideband sound sources"]}],"abstract":"Tracking moving wideband sound sources is one of the most challenging issues in the acoustic array signal processing which is based on the direction of arrival (DOA) estimation. Compressive sensing (CS) is a recent theory exploring the signal sparsity representation, which has been proved to be superior for the DOA estimation. However, the spatial aliasing and the offset at endfire are the main obstacles for CS applied in the wideband DOA estimation. We propose a particle filter based compressive sensing method for tracking moving wideband sound sources. First, the initial DOA estimates are obtained by wideband CS algorithms. Then, the real sources are approximated by a set of particles with different weights assigned. The kernel density estimator is used as the likelihood function of particle filter. We present the results for both uniform and random linear array. Simulation results show that the spatial aliasing is disappeared and the offset at endfire is reduced. We show that the proposed method can achieve satisfactory tracking performance regardless of using uniform or random linear array.","doi":"10.1109/CC.2018.8387998","publicationTitle":"China Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"China Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/6245522/8387978/08387998.pdf","startPage":"197","endPage":"210","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8387978","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CC.2018.8387998","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A particle filter based compressive sensing method for tracking moving wideband sound sources","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8387998","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2018","displayDocTitle":"A particle filter based compressive sensing method for tracking moving wideband sound sources","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8387998/","publicationDate":"May 2018","dateOfInsertion":"19 June 2018","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"17857707","volume":"15","issue":"5","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 June 2018","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A particle filter based compressive sensing method for tracking moving wideband sound sources","sourcePdf":"17.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.0202S","chronDate":"May  2018","isNumber":"8387978","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6245522","articleId":"8387998","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8387999,"authors":[{"name":"Rui Feng","affiliation":["Shandong University, Jinan, Shandong, CN"],"firstName":"Rui","lastName":"Feng"},{"name":"Yu Liu","affiliation":["Shandong University, Jinan, Shandong, CN"],"firstName":"Yu","lastName":"Liu"},{"name":"Jie Huang","affiliation":["Shandong University, Jinan, Shandong, CN"],"firstName":"Jie","lastName":"Huang"},{"name":"Jian Sun","affiliation":["Shandong University, Jinan, Shandong, CN"],"firstName":"Jian","lastName":"Sun"},{"name":"Cheng-Xiang Wang","affiliation":["Shandong University, Jinan, Shandong, CN"],"firstName":"Cheng-Xiang","lastName":"Wang"},{"name":"George Goussetis","affiliation":["Heriot-Watt University, Edinburgh, Edinburgh, GB"],"firstName":"George","lastName":"Goussetis"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1673-5447"}],"articleNumber":"8387999","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":378},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Signal processing algorithms","Channel estimation","Multiple signal classification","Estimation","Delays","Wireless communication","Covariance matrices"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","channel estimation","delay estimation","direction-of-arrival estimation","expectation-maximisation algorithm","signal classification","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MUSIC algorithm","SAGE algorithm","improved SI-JADE algorithm","wireless channel parameter estimation algorithms","multiple signal classification","Unitary ESPRIT algorithm","JADE ESPRIT","space-alternating generalized expectation-maximization algorithms","azimuth angle of arrival","array signal processing methods","elevation AoA","estimation of signal parameter via rotational invariance techniques","frequency 60.0 GHz"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["MUSIC","JADE MUSIC/ESPRIT","SI-JADE","SAGE algorithm","millimeter wave"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8387999","displayPublicationTitle":"China Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/6245522/8387978/08387999.pdf","startPage":"211","endPage":"228","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CC.2018.8387999","doi":"10.1109/CC.2018.8387999","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8387978","publicationTitle":"China Communications","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Wireless channel parameter estimation algorithms: Recent advances and future challenges","abstract":"Temporal and three-dimensional (3D) spatial information is important for the characterization of wireless channels. In this paper, the commonly used array signal processing (ASP) methods to estimate channel parameters are summarized. Firstly, algorithms that can be used to estimate azimuth angle of arrival (AAoA) and elevation AoA (EAoA) are introduced. They include multiple signal classification (MUSIC), estimation of signal parameter via rotational invariance techniques (ESPRIT), and Unitary ESPRIT algorithms. Secondly, algorithms that can be used to jointly estimate delay, AAoA, and EAoA are given. They include joint angle and delay estimation (JADE) MUSIC, JADE ESPRIT, shift-invariance (SI) JADE, and space-alternating generalized expectation-maximization (SAGE) algorithms. We also propose an improved SI-JADE algorithm to further reduce computation complexity by incorporating with the Unitary ESPRIT algorithm. Performance of the above algorithms to extract only spatial information and to jointly extract temporal and spatial information is compared in both synthetic and 60 GHz real channel environments. Simulation results show that with the inclusion of delay estimation, the joint temporal and spatial estimation algorithms can provide better resolution than algorithms estimating only angles. Measurement data processing results show that MUSIC algorithm can provide comparable results with SAGE algorithm in estimating AAoA and EAoA. SI-JADE and the improved SI-JADE algorithms are also applicable to process 60 GHz channel measurement data. However, MUSIC, SI-JADE, and the improved SI-JADE algorithms can greatly reduce computational burden compared with SAGE algorithm.

However, existing hybrid pre-coding based on singular value decomposition (SVD) requires the complicated bit allocation to match the different signal-to-noise-ratios (SNRs) of different sub-channels. In this paper, we propose a geometric mean decomposition (GMD)-based hybrid precoding to avoid the complicated bit allocation. Specifically, we seek a pair of analog and digital precoders sufficiently close to the unconstrained fully digital GMD precoder. To achieve this, we fix the analog precoder to design the digital precoder, and vice versa. The analog precoder is designed based on the orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP) algorithm, while GMD is used to obtain the digital precoder. Simulations show that the proposed GMD-based hybrid precoding achieves better performance than the conventional SVD-based hybrid precoding with only a slight increase in complexity.","doi":"10.1109/CC.2018.8388000","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8387978","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CC.2018.8388000","publicationTitle":"China Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"China Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/6245522/8387978/08388000.pdf","startPage":"229","endPage":"238","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Geometric mean decomposition based hybrid precoding for millimeter-wave massive MIMO","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 June 2018","displayDocTitle":"Geometric mean decomposition based hybrid precoding for millimeter-wave massive MIMO","volume":"15","issue":"5","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2018","dateOfInsertion":"19 June 2018","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May 2018","accessionNumber":"17857698","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8388000/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Geometric mean decomposition based hybrid precoding for millimeter-wave massive MIMO","sourcePdf":"19.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.04404S","chronDate":"May  2018","isNumber":"8387978","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6245522","citationCount":"16","articleId":"8388000","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8388187,"authors":[{"name":"Naiping Li","affiliation":["Department of Infectious Disease, Central South University, Changsha, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/8274985/8388187/li-2849016-small.gif","p":["Naiping Li received the M.M. degree in internal medicine from Central South University, Changsha, China, in 2013, where she is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree.

This paper aims to establish a non-invasive assessment model with serum markers using cloud computing and the Internet of Things for the evaluation of liver disease severity and its prognosis. Based on the Internet of Things, the multiple and key information system of liver fibrosis or cirrhosis are constructed using the serum markers data. In the cloud platform, the probability density functions of indexes are used to select the optimized indicators. The logistic regression is used to establish the non-invasive assessment model. The patients were selected with CHB and underwent liver biopsy in the Second Xiangya Hospital, Central South University. There are two inclusion criteria: first, the patient received a liver biopsy according to \u201cProclaim Prevention and Cure Guide For Chronic Hepatitis B\u201dof Chinese Medical Association in 2015; second, the patient has a history of hepatitis B or HBV surface antigen (HBsAg) positive more than six months, and HBsAg and (or) HBV DNA is still positive. Results of clinical data applications show that the accuracy of the non-invasive assessment model reaches greater than 70% for the recognition of significant liver fibrosis. In addition, the discriminant accuracy can be improved by increasing the number of indicators. The established non-invasive assessment model can be used for auxiliary clinical diagnosis after the further validation.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Non-Invasive Assessment Model of Liver Disease Severity by Serum Markers Using Cloud Computing and Internet of Things","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2849016","startPage":"33969","endPage":"33976","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2849016","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8274985","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/8274985/08388187.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8388187","topic":"Real-Time Edge Analytics for Big Data in Internet of Things","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 June 2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8388187/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2018","displayDocTitle":"Non-Invasive Assessment Model of Liver Disease Severity by Serum Markers Using Cloud Computing and Internet of Things","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"6","htmlLink":"/document/8388187/","dateOfInsertion":"10 July 2018","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"2018","accessionNumber":"17905795","isOpenAccess":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"81730064 and 81500455"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Non-Invasive Assessment Model of Liver Disease Severity by Serum Markers Using Cloud Computing and Internet of Things","sourcePdf":"access-li-2849016-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.095395S","chronDate":"2018","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"8274985","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","xplore-issue":"8274985","topics":["Real-Time Edge Analytics for Big Data in Internet of Things"],"articleId":"8388187","onlineDate":"19 June 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8388190,"authors":[{"name":"Jing Wang","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Contemporary Design and Integrated Manufacturing Technology, Ministry of Education, Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi\u2019an, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/8274985/8388190/wang-2848938-small.gif","p":["Jing Wang was born in Xi\u2019an in 1986.

While planning toolpath for multi-axis milling, accurate collision detection is usually time-consuming among complex solid bodies in the computer environment. Furthermore, how to avoid the collision automatically within limited space in the path planning stage still needs lots of experience. To this end, this paper presents a general collision detection and tool posture automatic adjustment approach for the multi-axis milling process. First, by analyzing the contact state of the tool-workpiece, the calculation model of the interference quantity is determined. A unified tool constraint mathematical model based on the interference quantity and the interference type is established. Second, three types of tool adjustment strategies are constructed, the sequential quadratic programming method is used to solve the model and the graphics processing unit-based high-performance computing technology is employed to accelerate the solution process. Finally, the developed method is validated for automatic collision and tool posture adjustment in the five-axis milling of a blisk. The presented method can be integrated into commercial CAD/CAM software for rapid tool collision detection and tool orientation modification.","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2848938","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/8274985/08388190.pdf","startPage":"35132","endPage":"35142","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2848938","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8274985","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A GPU-Accelerated Approach for Collision Detection and Tool Posture Modification in Multi-Axis Machining","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8388190","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 June 2018","chronOrPublicationDate":"2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8388190/","displayDocTitle":"A GPU-Accelerated Approach for Collision Detection and Tool Posture Modification in Multi-Axis Machining","volume":"6","publicationDate":"2018","accessionNumber":"17905796","isOpenAccess":true,"isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8388190/","dateOfInsertion":"10 July 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"China Major National Science and Technology Project","grantNumber":"2015ZX04001202"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"A GPU-Accelerated Approach for Collision Detection and Tool Posture Modification in Multi-Axis Machining","sourcePdf":"access-luo-2848938-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.103992S","chronDate":"2018","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"8274985","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8274985","articleId":"8388190","onlineDate":"19 June 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8388191,"authors":[{"name":"Siya Xu","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Networking and Switching Technology, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/8274985/8388191/xu-2848919-small.gif","p":["Siya Xu was born in Beijing, China, in 1988.

To fully utilize substrate resources, a virtual resource embedding method including three sub-mechanisms is presented in this paper. The first one is the priority-based virtual network request (VNR) selecting mechanism, which sorts VNRs and preferentially selects higher priority VNRs for embedding. Then a dynamic embedding mechanism based on load balancing is presented to increase the acceptance rate of VNRs. Second, when embedding is saturated, an embedding update mechanism is proposed to deal with the arrival of new VNRs. It promotes the acceptance rate of high-priority VNRs and the revenue of the infrastructure provider (InP). Finally, a backup resource sharing mechanism is designed to improve reliability, which enables backup resources to be shared and responds to the failures with minimal resources. The simulation results show that the proposed embedding method can balance the resource consumption better than the Greedy Node Embedding and Shortest-path Link Embedding Algorithm, as well as the Greedy Node Embedding and Maximum Residual Bandwidth Link Embedding Algorithm. Besides, by applying our proposed algorithm, higher VNR acceptance rate, InP revenue, and resource utilization are achieved.","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/8274985/08388191.pdf","startPage":"33201","endPage":"33215","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8274985","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2848919","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2848919","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8388191","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Substrates","Virtualization","Bandwidth","Wireless communication","Optical fiber networks","Load management","Manganese"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["broadband networks","telecommunication network reliability","virtualisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fiber-wireless network virtual resource Embedding method","load balancing","network virtualization","resource solidification problem","fiber-wireless access networks","substrate resources","priority-based virtual network request selecting mechanism","dynamic embedding mechanism","embedding update mechanism","high-priority VNRs","backup resource sharing mechanism","Greedy Node Embedding","Shortest-path Link Embedding Algorithm","Maximum Residual Bandwidth Link Embedding Algorithm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Fiber-wireless network","load balancing","network virtualization","dynamic embedding mechanism","resource utilization"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8388191/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 June 2018","displayDocTitle":"Fiber-Wireless Network Virtual Resource Embedding Method Based on Load Balancing and Priority","isOpenAccess":true,"accessionNumber":"17886077","dateOfInsertion":"04 July 2018","publicationDate":"2018","htmlLink":"/document/8388191/","volume":"6","isJournal":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"National Key R&D Program of China","grantNumber":"2016YFB0901200"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Fiber-Wireless Network Virtual Resource Embedding Method Based on Load Balancing and Priority","sourcePdf":"access-xu-2848919-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.097876S","chronDate":"2018","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"8274985","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"8274985","articleId":"8388191","onlineDate":"19 June 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8388197,"authors":[{"name":"Ruliang Xiao","affiliation":["College of Mathematics and Informatics, Fujian Normal University, Fuzhou, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/8274985/8388197/xiao-2849110-small.gif","p":["Ruliang Xiao was born in Loudi, Hunan, China, in 1966.

How to reduce the influence of speckle noise when conducting change detection in an acquired synthetic aperture radar (SAR) image is a challenging issue. This research shows that reasonably balancing noise suppression with the preservation of the edges of regions is the key to generating a good change map. Therefore, a new image detection method based on a selforganizing map and deep neural network (SOMDNCD) is proposed. First, the method uses a median filter to improve the difference image that is generated by the mean-ratio operator, which reduces the influence of the image point noise on generating difference maps. Compared with the difference map formed by the logarithmic ratio operator, the edge information in the image is excellently retained and the missed detection rate is reduced; second, the network preprocesses the difference map, obtains a preliminary change map, and divides the pixels of the difference map into three types: no change, noise, and change. Finally, a deep neural network is used to train a noise-like training set on the network to reduce the residual noise in the change class and obtain the final change graph. The experimental results show that compared with other current mainstream methods, the proposed SOMDNCD change detection method directly addresses noise and is universal for a variety of data sets. The proposed method exhibits a lower missed detection rate in the SAR image data set and a more ideal false alarm rate than other methods.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8388197/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 June 2018","chronOrPublicationDate":"2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","publicationDate":"2018","accessionNumber":"17905884","htmlLink":"/document/8388197/","isJournal":true,"isOpenAccess":true,"dateOfInsertion":"16 July 2018","volume":"6","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"SOMDNCD: Image Change Detection Based on Self-Organizing Maps and Deep Neural Networks","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Great Project of the Fujian Province Science and Technology Plan","grantNumber":"2016H6007"},{"fundingName":"City School Cooperation Project of the Fuzhou Science and Technology Bureau","grantNumber":"2016-G-40"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"SOMDNCD: Image Change Detection Based on Self-Organizing Maps and Deep Neural Networks","sourcePdf":"access-xiao-2849110-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.095932S","chronDate":"2018","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"8274985","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"8274985","articleId":"8388197","onlineDate":"19 June 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8388198,"authors":[{"name":"Ruifan Li","affiliation":["Engineering Research Center of Information Networks, Ministry of Education, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/8274985/8388198/li-2848966-small.gif","p":["Ruifan Li (M\u201913) received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in control systems, and in circuits and systems from Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China, in 1998 and 2001, respectively, the Ph.D. degree in signal and information processing from the Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications (BUPT), Beijing, China, in 2006.

However, the large variations in clothing images' appearances and styles and their complicated formation conditions make the problem challenging. In addition, a generic treatment with convolutional neural networks (CNNs) cannot provide a satisfactory solution considering the training time and recognition performance. Therefore, how to balance those two factors for clothing image recognition is an interesting problem. Motivated by the fast training and straightforward solutions exhibited by extreme learning machines (ELMs), in this paper, we propose a recognition framework that is based on multiple sources of features and ELM neural networks. In this framework, three types of features are first extracted, including CNN features with pre-trained networks, histograms of oriented gradients and color histograms. Second, those low-level features are concatenated and taken as the inputs to an autoencoder version of the ELM for deep feature-level fusion. Third, we propose an ensemble of adaptive ELMs for decision-level fusion using the previously obtained feature-level fusion representations. Extensive experiments are conducted on an up-to-date large-scale clothing image data set. Those experimental results show that the proposed framework is competitive and efficient.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8388198/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 June 2018","chronOrPublicationDate":"2018","volume":"6","isJournal":true,"isOpenAccess":true,"dateOfInsertion":"16 July 2018","publicationDate":"2018","accessionNumber":"17905885","htmlLink":"/document/8388198/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Multiple Features With Extreme Learning Machines For Clothing Image Recognition","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61273365, 61472046 and 61472048"},{"fundingName":"National Social Science Fund of China","grantNumber":"2016ZDA055"},{"fundingName":"Discipline Building Plan in 111 Base","grantNumber":"B08004"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Multiple Features With Extreme Learning Machines For Clothing Image Recognition","sourcePdf":"access-li-2848966-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.116345S","chronDate":"2018","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"8274985","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"8274985","articleId":"8388198","onlineDate":"19 June 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8388200,"authors":[{"name":"Huan Huang","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Optical Fiber Sensing and Communication Networks (Ministry of Education), School of Information and Communication Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China"],"bio":{"p":["Huan Huang received the B.S. degree from Anhui University, Hefei,\n China, in 2012.

In this proposed system, the predesigned OTTD-P with an interconnection matrix and a wavelength-controlling matrix is employed to control microwave beam steering and the controlling function is carried out in a central station (CS). A dense wavelength division multiplexing based demultiplexer is used to replace tunable filters in the BS and the cost-effective multiwavelength laser source is employed to generate uniformly spaced optical carriers in the CS. Without tunable filters and controlling modules, as well as the controlling function of beamforming in different BSs being concentrated in the CS, the complexity and cost of BSs can be greatly reduced. Finally, a proof-of-concept system employing OTTD-P with 24 wavelengths and four-element antennas, which are able to form seven basic PAA beams, is demonstrated. The obtained results successfully verify the feasibility of the proposed scheme.","doi":"10.1109/JLT.2018.2849001","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/50/8410388/08388200.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8410388","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JLT.2018.2849001","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","startPage":"3693","endPage":"3699","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optical True Time Delay Pools Based Centralized Beamforming Control for Wireless Base Stations Phased-Array Antennas","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8388200","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.1, 1 2018","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 June 2018","displayDocTitle":"Optical True Time Delay Pools Based Centralized Beamforming Control for Wireless Base Stations Phased-Array Antennas","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8388200/","volume":"36","issue":"17","htmlLink":"/document/8388200/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"1 Sept.1, 2018","accessionNumber":"17932645","dateOfInsertion":"12 July 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"National High Technology Research and Development Program","grantNumber":"2015AA015501"},{"fundingName":"Program for Joint Research of the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China","grantNumber":"2018STKY001"},{"fundingName":"111 Project","grantNumber":"B14039"},{"fundingName":"Sichuan Science and Technology Program","grantNumber":"2018JY0145"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optical True Time Delay Pools Based Centralized Beamforming Control for Wireless Base Stations Phased-Array Antennas","sourcePdf":"jlt-zhang-2849001-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.078358S","chronDate":"Sept.1, 1 2018","xplore-pub-id":"50","isNumber":"8410388","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"8410388","articleId":"8388200","onlineDate":"19 June 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8388207,"authors":[{"name":"Yasmeen Hussein Sabry","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Universiti Putra Malaysia, Serdang, Malaysia"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/8274985/8388207/ysabr-2848903-small.gif","p":["Yasmeen Hussein Sabry received the B.Sc. degree in mechanical engineering from the University of Technology-Baghdad, Iraq, in 2008.

To predict the output power and formulate the performance of this type of photovoltaic (PV) system, the proposed approach analyzes a Thin-Film solar cadmium telluride-type module and develops a custom neural network (CNN) for modeling its generated power expressed by its mathematical formula. Experiments for single and multilayer installation topologies are conducted for performance analysis. The coefficients of the model equation are investigated based on a set of power-current curves. The developed model adopts three factors: a minimum number of hidden neurons, the use of all measured data to train the network weights, and a linear output activation function to reduce the complexity of solving the network equations. The results specify the limit at which this type of PV starts generating power from the experimental measurements and the comparison with its equivalent normal PV module. The CNN-based STPV module is verified by comparing with the experimental measurements results, which shows a reasonable R-square, while its performance is evaluated on the silicon-based PV by comparing its behavior with the two-diode model PV in the MATLAB-based simulation.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8388207/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 June 2018","isJournal":true,"isOpenAccess":true,"accessionNumber":"17905798","volume":"6","htmlLink":"/document/8388207/","publicationDate":"2018","dateOfInsertion":"10 July 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Measurement-Based Modeling of a Semitransparent CdTe Thin-Film PV Module Based on a Custom Neural Network","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004530","fundingName":"Universiti Putra Malaysia","grantNumber":"9515302"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Measurement-Based Modeling of a Semitransparent CdTe Thin-Film PV Module Based on a Custom Neural Network","sourcePdf":"access-sabry-2848903-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.08498S","chronDate":"2018","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"8274985","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"8274985","articleId":"8388207","onlineDate":"19 June 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-12-12"},{"_id":8388209,"authors":[{"name":"Hui-Ming Wang","affiliation":["MOE Key Laboratory for Intelligent Networks and Network Security, Xi\u2019an Jiaotong University, Xi\u2019an, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/8536744/8388209/wang-2848910-small.gif","p":["Hui-Ming Wang (S\u201907\u2013M\u201910\u2013SM\u201916) received the B.S. and Ph.D. degrees (Hons) in electrical engineering from Xi\u2019an Jiaotong University, Xi\u2019an, China, in 2004 and 2010, respectively.

In this paper, we exploit the technique of base station (BS) cooperation to improve the performance of the cell-edge users in the downlink transmission of mmWave cellular networks. We design two cooperative schemes, which are referred to as fixed-number BS cooperation (FNC) scheme and fixed-region BS cooperation (FRC) scheme, respectively. In the FNC scheme, the cooperative BSs consist of the M nearest BSs around the served cell-edge users, and in the FRC scheme, the cooperative BSs include all the BSs located within a given region. We derive the expressions for the average rate and the outage probability of a typical cell-edge user located at the origin based on the stochastic geometry framework. To reduce the computational complexity of our analytical results for the outage probability, we further propose a Gamma approximation-based method to provide approximations with satisfying accuracy. Our analytical results incorporate the critical characteristics of mmWave channels, i.e., the blockage effects, the different path loss of LOS and NLOS links, and the highly directional antenna arrays. Simulation results show that the performance of the cell-edge users is greatly improved when mmWave networks are combined with the technique of BS cooperation.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8388209/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 June 2018","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2018","volume":"66","issue":"11","accessionNumber":"18247982","dateOfInsertion":"15 November 2018","publicationDate":"Nov. 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8388209/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Base Station Cooperation in Millimeter Wave Cellular Networks: Performance Enhancement of Cell-Edge Users","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61671364"},{"fundingName":"Outstanding Young Research Fund of Shaanxi Province","grantNumber":"2018JC-003"},{"fundingName":"Young Talent Support Fund of Science and Technology of Shaanxi Province","grantNumber":"2015KJXX-01"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Base Station Cooperation in Millimeter Wave Cellular Networks: Performance Enhancement of Cell-Edge Users","sourcePdf":"tcomm-huang-2848910-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.172185S","chronDate":"Nov.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"8536744","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"8536744","articleId":"8388209","onlineDate":"19 June 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8388215,"authors":[{"name":"Aibin Yan","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Technology, Anhui University, Hefei, China"],"firstName":"Aibin","lastName":"Yan","orcid":"0000-0003-0024-987X","id":"37085495911"},{"name":"Kang Yang","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Technology, Anhui University, Hefei, China"],"firstName":"Kang","lastName":"Yang","orcid":"0000-0002-2443-3092","id":"37086553829"},{"name":"Zhengfeng Huang","affiliation":["School of Electronic Science and Applied Physics, Hefei University of Technology, Hefei, China"],"firstName":"Zhengfeng","lastName":"Huang","id":"37630683200"},{"name":"Jiliang Zhang","affiliation":["College of Computer Science and Electronic Engineering, Hunan University, Changsha, China"],"firstName":"Jiliang","lastName":"Zhang","orcid":"0000-0001-8712-2964","id":"37086609318"},{"name":"Jie Cui","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Technology, Anhui University, Hefei, China"],"firstName":"Jie","lastName":"Cui","id":"37086045646"},{"name":"Xiangsheng Fang","affiliation":["School of Electronic Science and Applied Physics, Hefei University of Technology, Hefei, China"],"firstName":"Xiangsheng","lastName":"Fang","id":"37086611519"},{"name":"Maoxiang Yi","affiliation":["School of Electronic Science and Applied Physics, Hefei University of Technology, Hefei, China"],"firstName":"Maoxiang","lastName":"Yi","orcid":"0000-0002-5160-0933","id":"37592607800"},{"name":"Xiaoqing Wen","affiliation":["Graduate School of Computer Science and Systems Engineering, Kyushu Institute of Technology, Fukuoka, Japan"],"firstName":"Xiaoqing","lastName":"Wen","orcid":"0000-0001-8305-604X","id":"37085422219"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1549-7747"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-3791"}],"articleNumber":"8388215","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":11,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":503},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Circuits and Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieee-cas.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8388215","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Integrated circuit reliability","Radiation hardening (electronics)","Flip-flops","Logic desgin","Low-power electronics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["flip-flops","logic design","low-power electronics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["double-node-upset","low power application","high speed transmission path","low power dissipation","delay-power-area product","high performance application","self-recoverable latch design","mutually feeding back C-elements","DNU self-recoverable latch designs"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Circuit reliability","radiation hardening","soft error","double-node upset","single node upset"]}],"abstract":"This brief presents a double-node upset (DNU) self-recoverable latch design for high performance and low power application.

This is because they may induce low-weight codewords or absorbing sets in that case. Thus, it is important to count the number of short cycles not satisfying the FRC as well as the number of short cycles for analyzing the performance of an NB-LDPC code. In this paper, we first develop a novel message-passing algorithm and identify how it is related to the FRC. We then propose a low-complexity algorithm for counting the number of short cycles not satisfying the FRC in an NB-LDPC code, as well as the number of short cycles. Finally, we propose a low-complexity algorithm for designing an NB-LDPC code with low error floor. Depending on the modulation scheme, the codes constructed by the proposed design algorithm have similar or slightly worse performance, compared with those constructed via the method by Poulliat et al. However, the proposed design algorithm does not require a cycle enumeration algorithm with high complexity, and therefore is feasible even in the case of large code length, say \u22655000.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8388219/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 June 2018","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2018","volume":"66","issue":"11","accessionNumber":"18247969","dateOfInsertion":"15 November 2018","publicationDate":"Nov. 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8388219/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Design of Nonbinary LDPC Codes Based on Message-Passing Algorithms","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003725","fundingName":"National Research Foundation of Korea"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003725","fundingName":"National Research Foundation of Korea","grantNumber":"2016R1A2A1A05005023"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100010418","fundingName":"Institute for Information and communications Technology Promotion"},{"fundingName":"MSIT of the Korea government","grantNumber":"2018(2016-0-00123)"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design of Nonbinary LDPC Codes Based on Message-Passing Algorithms","sourcePdf":"tcomm-yang-2849076-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.157499S","chronDate":"Nov.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"8536744","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","xplore-issue":"8536744","articleId":"8388219","onlineDate":"19 June 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8388220,"authors":[{"name":"Jing wei Tan","affiliation":["Bioinformatics Programme, Institute of Biological Sciences, University of Malaya, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8857/8984637/8388220/tan-2848653-small.gif","p":["Jing Wei Tan received the BSc degree in bioinformatics form the University of Malaya, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, in 2016.

Deep learning is robust for feature extraction as it is superior in providing deeper information of images. In this research, a new CNN-based method named D-Leaf was proposed. The leaf images were pre-processed and the features were extracted by using three different Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models namely pre-trained AlexNet, fine-tuned AlexNet, and D-Leaf. These features were then classified by using five machine learning techniques, namely, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Artificial Neural Network (ANN), k-Nearest-Neighbor (k-NN), Na\u00efve-Bayes (NB), and CNN. A conventional morphometric method computed the morphological measurements based on the Sobel segmented veins was employed for benchmarking purposes. The D-Leaf model achieved a comparable testing accuracy of 94.88 percent as compared to AlexNet (93.26 percent) and fine-tuned AlexNet (95.54 percent) models. In addition, CNN models performed better than the traditional morphometric measurements (66.55 percent). The features extracted from the CNN are found to be fitted well with the ANN classifier.","doi":"10.1109/TCBB.2018.2848653","publicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Computational Biology and Bioinformatics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Computational Biology and Bioinformatics","pdfPath":"/iel7/8857/8984637/08388220.pdf","startPage":"82","endPage":"90","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8984637","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCBB.2018.2848653","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Deep Learning for Plant Species Classification Using Leaf Vein Morphometric","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8388220","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.-Feb. 1 2020","displayDocTitle":"Deep Learning for Plant Species Classification Using Leaf Vein Morphometric","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8388220/","publicationDate":"1 Jan.-Feb. 2020","dateOfInsertion":"05 February 2020","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"19351808","pubMedId":"29994129","htmlLink":"/document/8388220/","volume":"17","issue":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 June 2018","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"University of Malaya Research","grantNumber":"RP038C-15AET"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Deep Learning for Plant Species Classification Using Leaf Vein Morphometric","sourcePdf":"tcbb-chang-2848653-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.230545S","chronDate":"Jan.-Feb. 1 2020","xplore-pub-id":"8857","isNumber":"8984637","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8857","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"8984637","articleId":"8388220","onlineDate":"19 June 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2020","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8388222,"authors":[{"name":"Wei Cao","affiliation":["National Key Laboratory of Science and Technology on Communications and the Center for Intelligent Networking and Communications, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/8536744/8388222/cao-2848940-small.gif","p":["Wei Cao (S\u201918) received the B.Eng. degree in electronic engineering from the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC) in 2009.

The concurrent massive access in mMTC may lead to congestion due to limited access resources. Group paging (GP) is emerging as one of the promising solutions to alleviate network congestion by controlling access load. However, the performance of GP deteriorates drastically with the number of devices per paging group. This paper explores GP with a pre-backoff strategy for a general mMTC scenario in which devices are allowed to have diverse access success probability (ASP) requirements, and proposes a differentiated service-aware GP scheme with specific pre-backoff times (GPSP), with the aim of maximizing the total access rate while guaranteeing the ASP requirements for individual devices. An optimal solution to the GPSP problem is derived to provide a performance upper bound. As low-complexity algorithms are of key importance for mMTC applications, an efficient heuristic algorithm is further designed. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed GPSP scheme can effectively improve the system performance in terms of average ASP, average access delay, and the average number of preamble transmissions.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2018.2848940","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8536744","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2018.2848940","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/8536744/08388222.pdf","startPage":"5444","endPage":"5456","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Differentiated Service-Aware Group Paging for Massive Machine-Type Communication","chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/26/8536744/8388222-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 June 2018","displayDocTitle":"Differentiated Service-Aware Group Paging for Massive Machine-Type Communication","volume":"66","issue":"11","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2018","dateOfInsertion":"15 November 2018","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8388222/","publicationDate":"Nov. 2018","accessionNumber":"18248012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8388222/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China Major Project","grantNumber":"61631004"},{"fundingName":"Chinese Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities","grantNumber":"ZYGX2015Z005"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"CNS-1702808 and ECCS-1647198"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","chorusFlag":"true","title":"Differentiated Service-Aware Group Paging for Massive Machine-Type Communication","sourcePdf":"tcomm-cao-2848940-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.177458S","chronDate":"Nov.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"8536744","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"8536744","articleId":"8388222","onlineDate":"19 June 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8388225,"authors":[{"name":"John Ray Bergado","affiliation":["Department of Earth Observation Science, Faculty of Geoinformation Science and Earth Observation, University of Twente, Enschede, The Netherlands"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/36/8509678/8388225/berga-2837357-small.gif","p":["John Ray Bergado received the B.Sc. degree (magna cum laude) in geodetic engineering from the University of the Philippines Diliman, Quezon City, Philippines, in 2013, and the M.Sc. degree (Hons.) in geoinformation science and earth observation specializing in geoinformatics from the Faculty of Geoinformation Science and Earth Observation, University of Twente, Enschede, The Netherlands, in 2016, where he is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree with the Department of Earth Observation Science.

Conventional methods have addressed these challenges by adopting separate stages of image fusion, feature extraction, and postclassification map regularization. These processing stages, however, are not jointly optimizing the classification task at hand. In this paper, we propose a single-stage framework embedding the processing stages in a recurrent multiresolution convolutional network trained in an end-to-end manner. The feedforward version of the network, called FuseNet, aims to match the resolution of the panchromatic and multispectral bands in a VHR image using convolutional layers with corresponding downsampling and upsampling operations. Contextual label information is incorporated into FuseNet by means of a recurrent version called ReuseNet. We compared FuseNet and ReuseNet against the use of separate processing steps for both image fusions, e.g., pansharpening and resampling through interpolation and map regularization such as conditional random fields. We carried out our experiments on a land-cover classification task using a Worldview-03 image of Quezon City, Philippines, and the International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing 2-D semantic labeling benchmark data set of Vaihingen, Germany. FuseNet and ReuseNet surpass the baseline approaches in both the quantitative and qualitative results.","doi":"10.1109/TGRS.2018.2837357","startPage":"6361","endPage":"6374","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2018.2837357","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8509678","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel7/36/8509678/08388225.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Recurrent Multiresolution Convolutional Networks for VHR Image Classification","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8388225/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Recurrent Multiresolution Convolutional Networks for VHR Image Classification","volume":"56","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/8388225/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"18194388","publicationDate":"Nov. 2018","dateOfInsertion":"25 October 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2018","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 June 2018","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Recurrent Multiresolution Convolutional Networks for VHR Image Classification","sourcePdf":"tgrs-persello-2837357-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.107819S","chronDate":"Nov.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"36","isNumber":"8509678","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"8509678","articleId":"8388225","onlineDate":"19 June 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-10"},{"_id":8388248,"authors":[{"name":"Shahbaz Rezaei","affiliation":["Department of Computer Engineering, Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Iran"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/8536744/8388248/rezae-2848905-small.gif","p":["Shahbaz Rezaei received the B.S. degree in computer engineering from the University of Science and Culture, Tehran, Iran, in 2011, and the M.S. degree from the Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, in 2013.

It has been shown that sending more packets than maximum achievable end-to-end throughput not only fails to increase throughput but also decreases throughput owing to high contention and collision. Accordingly, it is of crucial importance for a source node to know the maximum end-to-end throughput. The end-to-end throughput depends on multiple factors, such as physical layer limitations, medium access control (MAC) protocol properties, routing policy, and nodes' distribution. There have been many studies on analytical modeling of end-to-end throughput but none of them has taken routing policy and nodes' distribution as well as MAC layer altogether into account. In this paper, the end-to-end throughput with perfect MAC layer is obtained based on routing policy and nodes' distribution in 1-D and 2-D networks. Then, imperfections of IEEE 802.11 protocol are added to the model to obtain precise value. An exhaustive simulation is also made to validate the proposed models using ns-2 simulator. Results show that if the distribution to the next hop for a particular routing policy is known, our methodology can obtain the maximum end-to-end throughput precisely.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2018.2848905","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8536744","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2018.2848905","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/8536744/08388248.pdf","startPage":"5430","endPage":"5443","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Throughput Analysis of IEEE 802.11 Multi-Hop Wireless Networks With Routing Consideration: A General Framework","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 June 2018","displayDocTitle":"Throughput Analysis of IEEE 802.11 Multi-Hop Wireless Networks With Routing Consideration: A General Framework","volume":"66","issue":"11","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2018","dateOfInsertion":"15 November 2018","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8388248/","publicationDate":"Nov. 2018","accessionNumber":"18247994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8388248/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Throughput Analysis of IEEE 802.11 Multi-Hop Wireless Networks With Routing Consideration: A General Framework","sourcePdf":"tcomm-gharib-2848905-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.098437S","chronDate":"Nov.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"8536744","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"8536744","articleId":"8388248","onlineDate":"19 June 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8388251,"authors":[{"name":"Thanh Cong Nguyen","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Information Engineering, Seoul National University of Science and Technology, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Thanh Cong","lastName":"Nguyen","orcid":"0000-0003-0250-3624","id":"37086452126"},{"name":"Ji-Hoon Yun","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Information Engineering, Seoul National University of Science and Technology, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Ji-Hoon","lastName":"Yun","orcid":"0000-0001-7438-1502","id":"37069973400"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-7798"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2558"},{"format":"CD","value":"2373-7891"}],"articleNumber":"8388251","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":14,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":998},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Streaming media","Servers","Gaussian distribution","Prediction algorithms","Resists","Predictive models","Virtual reality"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multimedia communication","normal distribution","set theory","video cameras","video coding","video streaming","virtual reality"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["videos spatial tiles","users future viewport","closed form","VR video streaming","predictive tile selection","normal distribution","fixation point prediction","error distribution","current viewport","virtual reality users","360-degree video bandwidth-efficiently","bandwidth-limited networks"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Virtual reality","360 video","video streaming","video tile selection"]}],"abstract":"To stream 360-degree video bandwidth-efficiently to virtual reality users, only a subset of a video's spatial tiles corresponding to the current viewport of a user can be transferred, but tile selection is challenging since a user's viewport keeps moving over time.

Thanks to the broadcast nature of wireless channels, dedicated RF signals for delivering information to specific devices can also be received by others for energy harvesting. Coordinating the conventional wireless information transfer and the wireless energy transfer (WET) requires a systematic design in all OSI layers, which yields data and energy integrated communication networks. Based on the classic carrier-sense-multiple-access with collision avoidance protocol, we originally propose a distributed multiple access protocol in the medium access control (MAC) layer for the indoor wireless-local-area-network (WLAN) powered by RF signal-based WET. The operation of our proposed protocol in the WET powered indoor WLAN is modeled by a multi-dimensional Markov chain, which is exploited for deriving the closed-form throughput of the WLAN studied. The simulation results demonstrate the accuracy of our theoretical analysis, which pave the way for the future optimization design in the MAC layer of WET powered indoor WLAN.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8388254/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 June 2018","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2018","volume":"66","issue":"11","accessionNumber":"18247986","dateOfInsertion":"15 November 2018","publicationDate":"Nov. 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8388254/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Modelling and Performance Analysis of Wireless LAN Enabled by RF Energy Transfer","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61601097, U1705263 and 61620106011"},{"fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities","grantNumber":"ZYGX2016Z011"},{"fundingName":"Huawei Innovation Research Program (HIRP)"},{"fundingName":"111 project","grantNumber":"B14039"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modelling and Performance Analysis of Wireless LAN Enabled by RF Energy Transfer","sourcePdf":"tcomm-hu-2848974-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.186295S","chronDate":"Nov.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"8536744","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"8536744","articleId":"8388254","onlineDate":"19 June 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8388257,"authors":[{"name":"Jihoon Choi","affiliation":["Department of Information and Telecommunication Engineering, Korea Aerospace University, Goyang, South Korea"],"firstName":"Jihoon","lastName":"Choi","orcid":"0000-0002-5433-2241","id":"37085339159"},{"name":"Suyong Han","affiliation":["Department of Information and Telecommunication Engineering, Korea Aerospace University, Goyang, South Korea"],"firstName":"Suyong","lastName":"Han","orcid":"0000-0003-4608-0803","id":"37086460110"},{"name":"Jingon Joung","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Chung-Ang University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Jingon","lastName":"Joung","orcid":"0000-0002-9551-1123","id":"37289977300"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9545"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1939-9359"}],"articleNumber":"8388257","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":395},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Vehicular Technology Society","url":"http://www.vtsociety.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO communication","Transmitting antennas","Precoding","Iterative methods","Newton method","Complexity theory","Matrix decomposition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","cellular radio","linear codes","MIMO communication","multi-access systems","Newton method","optimisation","precoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["PAPC precoder","near-optimal performance","power consumption","macrocell base stations","low-complexity multiuser MIMO precoder design","per-antenna power constraints","precoder design method","multiinput multioutput systems","optimal zero-forcing based precoder","SPC","modified Newton method","PAPC","precoding schemes","complexity order","multiuser MIMO system","design procedure","optimal ZF-based SPC precoder","linear precoder closest","ZF-based precoder","conventional sum power constraint","MIMO systems","sum rate"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Precoding","multiuser MIMO","per-antenna power constraints","zero-forcing","sum rate maximization"]}],"abstract":"A new precoder design method is proposed for multi-input multioutput (MIMO) systems with per-antenna power constraints (PAPCs). In the proposed scheme, the optimal zero-forcing (ZF) based precoder maximizing the sum rate is evaluated for MIMO systems under the conventional sum power constraint (SPC), after which a new ZF-based precoder conforming to the PAPCs is designed by finding the linear precoder closest to the optimal ZF-based SPC precoder. Using the proposed design procedure, we derive an iterative algorithm based on the modified Newton's method to construct a PAPC precoder for a multiuser MIMO system. The complexity order of the proposed method is compared with those of the existing precoding schemes, and it is shown through numerical simulations that the proposed PAPC precoder achieves near-optimal performance while reducing the power consumption at macrocell base stations.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2018.2849021","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular

Varactor tuning technology associated with open loop stub loaded resonator microstrip topology were investigated to achieve these goals. The proposed dual-bandpass filter design showed the agility to independently control the center frequencies in the two L-bands and to deactivate one of the passbands. Furthermore, it shows enough flexibility to adapt to the deployment of new GNSS standards specifications.

Symmetric PIR (SPIR) is a generalization of PIR to include the requirement that beyond the desired message, the user learns nothing about the other K - 1 messages. The information theoretic capacity of SPIR (equivalently, the reciprocal of minimum download cost) is the maximum number of bits of desired information that can be privately retrieved per bit of downloaded information. We show that the capacity of SPIR is 1-1/N regardless of the number of messages K, if the databases have access to common randomness (not available to the user) that is independent of the messages, in the amount that is at least 1/(N -1) bits per desired message bit. Otherwise, if the amount of common randomness is less than 1/(N -1) bits per message bit, then the capacity of SPIR is zero. Extensions to the capacity region of SPIR and the capacity of finite length SPIR are provided.","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2018.2848977","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8581519","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2018.2848977","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel7/18/8581519/08388267.pdf","startPage":"322","endPage":"329","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The Capacity of Symmetric Private Information Retrieval","chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/18/8581519/8388267-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 June 2018","displayDocTitle":"The Capacity of Symmetric Private Information Retrieval","volume":"65","issue":"1","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2019","dateOfInsertion":"19 December 2018","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8388267/","publicationDate":"Jan. 2019","accessionNumber":"18328948","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8388267/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"ONR","grantNumber":"N00014-16-1-2629 and N00014-18-1-2057"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"CCF-1317351, CCF-1617504 and CNS-1731384"},{"fundingName":"ARL","grantNumber":"W911NF-16-1-0215"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","chorusFlag":"true","title":"The Capacity of Symmetric Private Information Retrieval","sourcePdf":"tit-sun-2848977-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.095859S","chronDate":"Jan.  2019","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"8581519","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"57","xplore-issue":"8581519","articleId":"8388267","onlineDate":"19 June 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8388273,"authors":[{"name":"Xabier Insausti","affiliation":["Biomedical Engineering and Sciences Department, Tecnun (University of Navarra), San Seb\u00e1stin, Spain"],"firstName":"Xabier","lastName":"Insausti","orcid":"0000-0001-9628-0681","id":"38299356300"},{"name":"Pedro M.

The simulation model coupling thermal-fluid-electrical and dispersed particle problems incorporates three ac electrokinetics (ACEK) phenomena, namely, the ac electrothermal effect (ACET), thermal buoyancy (TB), and dielectrophoresis (DEP). The electrode-multilayered microfluidic device was fabricated with 40 electrodes exposed at the flow channel sidewalls in five cross sections. The governing equations of the simulation model are solved by the Eulerian-Lagrangian method with finite volume discretization. Fluid flow simulations in three cases with or without consideration of ACET and TB are performed to clarify the contributions of these phenomena. The fluid flow is found to be composed of short-range vortices due to ACET and long-range circulation due to TB based on the features of the electrode-multilayered microfluidic device. The 3-D particle trajectory influenced by the fluid flow is compared with four values of the real part of the Clausius-Mossotti (CM) factor to evaluate the DEP phenomenon. The simulation model is validated by experiments using a cell suspension. The pattern of cell trajectories in the upper part of the flow channel measured by particle tracking velocimetry agrees with the simulated pattern. By comparison of the simulation and experiment, it is found that the cells moving straight away from the electrode on the focal plane are decelerated within the region of 60 \u03bcm from the electrode by positiveDEP with Re[K(\u03c9)] = 0.08-0.11. Furthermore, the 3-D DEPeffective region and the ACET and TB dominant regions for the cells are predicted by evaluating the particle-fluid relative velocity due to DEP force with Re[K(\u03c9)] = 0.10. Consequently, the flow mechanism and dominant region of each ACEK phenomenon in the device are clarified from the 3-D simulation validated by the experiments.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Numerical Study of Particle-Fluid Flow Under AC Electrokinetics in Electrode-Multilayered Microfluidic Device","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","doi":"10.1109/TBME.2018.2849004","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel7/10/8620167/08388274.pdf","startPage":"453","endPage":"463","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TBME.2018.2849004","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8620167","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8388274","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8388274/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 June 2018","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2019","displayDocTitle":"Numerical Study of Particle-Fluid Flow Under AC Electrokinetics in Electrode-Multilayered Microfluidic Device","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"66","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/8388274/","dateOfInsertion":"21 January 2019","publicationDate":"Feb. 2019","accessionNumber":"18379176","pubMedId":"29993454","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001691","fundingName":"Japan Society for the Promotion of Science","grantNumber":"16H02312"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"51706098"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004608","fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province","grantNumber":"BK20170792"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Numerical Study of Particle-Fluid Flow Under AC Electrokinetics in Electrode-Multilayered Microfluidic Device","sourcePdf":"tbme-yao-2849004-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.073425S","chronDate":"Feb.  2019","xplore-pub-id":"10","isNumber":"8620167","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"8620167","articleId":"8388274","onlineDate":"19 June 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8388275,"authors":[{"name":"Mahmoud T.

The converter operates in the single-source mode, dual-source mode (DSM), and backup mode automatically by detecting the input and output conditions. Converter operation in the proposed DSM enables extraction of power from both a photovoltaic cell and a thermoelectric generator in one switching cycle for efficient power extraction. The cycle-by-cycle source-tracking approach selects the appropriate input source according to the maximum power point of the energy transducers. The adaptive on-time circuit with the proposed adaptive peak-inductor-current (APIC) control adjusts the on-time of power transistors to obtain high conversion efficiency under different input voltages. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed SITITO converter has a peak efficiency of 84.4%. When compared with the conventional constant peak-inductor-current control, an efficiency improvement of 11% is obtained via the proposed APIC control.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of

bandwidths are proposed in this brief. In addition to the basic TCSR's three poles and four zeros, the extra four poles and three zeros can be introduced with the help of a pair of symmetrical parallel-coupled lines and open-ended stubs. Therefore, a planar DB-BPF with multiple transmission poles and zeros can be realized. To achieve the reconfigurable bandwidths, a capacitor is inserted into the basic TCSR's lower stub. It is found that the lower bandedge of the first passband can be tuned while the other three bandedges are kept unchanged. Two prototypes, including fixed-bandwidth filter (Filter I) with 3-dB fractional bandwidths (FBWs) of 20.8% and 17.3%, and reconfigurable-bandwidth filter (Filter II) with 3-dB FBW variation from 22.5% to 34.7% for the first passband and 19.8% for the second passband, are designed, fabricated, and experimentally characterized. The experimental characterizations of these two filters verify the proposed design.","doi":"10.1109/TCSII.2018.2848667","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs","pdfPath":"/iel7/8920/8653436/08388279.pdf","startPage":"317","endPage":"321","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8653436","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSII.2018.2848667","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design of Dual-Band Bandpass Filters With Fixed and Reconfigurable Bandwidths Based on Terminated Cross-Shaped Resonators","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8388279","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2019","displayDocTitle":"Design of Dual-Band Bandpass Filters With Fixed and Reconfigurable Bandwidths Based on Terminated Cross-Shaped Resonators","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8388279/","publicationDate":"March 2019","dateOfInsertion":"26 February 2019","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"18489610","htmlLink":"/document/8388279/","volume":"66","issue":"3","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 June 2018","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100006469","fundingName":"Fundo para o Desenvolvimento das Ci\u00eancias e da Tecnologia","grantNumber":"FDCT 014/2015/AMJ"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004733","fundingName":"Universidade de Macau","grantNumber":"MYRG 2016-00093-FST, MYRG 2015-00042-FST and MYRG 2018-00076-FST"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design of Dual-Band Bandpass Filters With Fixed and Reconfigurable Bandwidths Based on Terminated Cross-Shaped Resonators","sourcePdf":"tcsii-bi-2848667-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.071825S","chronDate":"March  2019","xplore-pub-id":"8920","isNumber":"8653436","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8920","citationCount":"27","xplore-issue":"8653436","articleId":"8388279","onlineDate":"19 June 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8388285,"authors":[{"name":"Lihua Zhang","affiliation":["NCMIS, CEMS, RCSDS, Academy of Mathematics and Systems Science, CAS, Beijing","School of Mathematical Sciences, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8857/9055294/8388285/zhang-2848633-small.gif","p":["Lihua Zhang is working toward the PhD degree in the Academy of Mathematics and Systems Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences.

One of the main challenges when analyzing scRNA-seq data is the presence of zeros or dropout events, which may mislead downstream analyses. To compensate the dropout effect, several methods have been developed to impute gene expression since the first Bayesian-based method being proposed in 2016. However, these methods have shown very diverse characteristics in terms of model hypothesis and imputation performance. Thus, large-scale comparison and evaluation of these methods is urgently needed now. To this end, we compared eight imputation methods, evaluated their power in recovering original real data, and performed broad analyses to explore their effects on clustering cell types, detecting differentially expressed genes, and reconstructing lineage trajectories in the context of both simulated and real data. Simulated datasets and case studies highlight that there are no one method performs the best in all the situations. Some defects of these methods such as scalability, robustness, and unavailability in some situations need to be addressed in future studies.","doi":"10.1109/TCBB.2018.2848633","publicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Computational Biology and Bioinformatics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Computational Biology and Bioinformatics","pdfPath":"/iel7/8857/9055294/08388285.pdf","startPage":"376","endPage":"389","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9055294","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCBB.2018.2848633","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Comparison of Computational Methods for Imputing Single-Cell RNA-Sequencing Data","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8388285","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"March-April 1 2020","displayDocTitle":"Comparison of Computational Methods for Imputing Single-Cell RNA-Sequencing Data","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8388285/","publicationDate":"1 March-April 2020","dateOfInsertion":"02 April 2020","isJournal":true,"pubMedId":"29994128","htmlLink":"/document/8388285/","volume":"17","issue":"2","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 June 2018","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"11661141019, 61621003, 61422309 and 61379092"},{"fundingName":"Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences","grantNumber":"XDB13040600"},{"fundingName":"National Ten Thousand Talent Program for Young Top-notch Talents"},{"fundingName":"Key Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences","grantNumber":"KFZD-SW-219"},{"fundingName":"CAS Frontier Science Research Key Project for Top Young Scientist","grantNumber":"QYZDB-SSW-SYS008"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Comparison of Computational Methods for Imputing Single-Cell RNA-Sequencing Data","sourcePdf":"tcbb-zhang-2848633-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.117117S","chronDate":"March-April 1 2020","xplore-pub-id":"8857","isNumber":"9055294","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8857","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"9055294","articleId":"8388285","onlineDate":"19 June 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2020","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8388287,"authors":[{"name":"Mohammad Amin Kardan","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Shiraz University, Shiraz, Iran"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/28/8467516/8388287/karda-2848959-small.gif","p":["Mohammad Amin Kardan received the B.Sc. degree in 2015 and the M.Sc.\n degree in control engineering, in 2017, both from the Shiraz University, Shiraz, Iran.","His research interests include state estimation and Kalman filtering."]},"firstName":"Mohammad Amin","lastName":"Kardan","id":"37086456948"},{"name":"Mohammad Hassan Asemani","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Shiraz University, Shiraz, Iran"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/28/8467516/8388287/asema-2848959-small.gif","p":["Mohammad Hassan Asemani received the B.Sc. degree from the Shiraz\n University, Shiraz, Iran, in 2006, and the M.Sc. and Ph.D. degrees in control engineering from Tarbiat Modares\n University, Tehran, Iran, in 2008 and 2012, respectively.","Since 2013, he has been an Assistant Professor with the Power and Control Department, Shiraz University.

By considering a centralized controller scheme, the limitations of the communication utilities are considered. Therefore, limited information is transferred through the nonideal noisy communication network. Consequently, a cubature Kalman filter (CKF) with a third degree is proposed to mitigate the effect of the noisy measurement and the noisy network on the system's information. Moreover, an estimation-based robust feedback controller is developed to design an optimal value for the injecting power. The considered CKF algorithm is robust against the system uncertainty and noisy environments and has a low computational time for high-order dc MGs with a high number of sources and CPLs. In addition, a systematic procedure to compute the feedback gain of the controller is presented, which can be numerically solved by linear matrix inequality techniques. Hardware-in-the-loop real-time simulation results verify the simplicity of the controller implementation, enhanced performance for the case of limited information, and better robustness against the noisy measurements compared to the state-of-the-art methods.","doi":"10.1109/TIA.2018.2848959","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","pdfPath":"/iel7/28/8467516/08388287.pdf","startPage":"5104","endPage":"5112","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8467516","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIA.2018.2848959","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improved Stabilization of Nonlinear DC Microgrids: Cubature Kalman Filter Approach","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8388287","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.-Oct.  2018","displayDocTitle":"Improved Stabilization of Nonlinear DC Microgrids: Cubature Kalman Filter Approach","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8388287/","publicationDate":"Sept.-Oct. 2018","dateOfInsertion":"18 September 2018","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"18095198","htmlLink":"/document/8388287/","volume":"54","issue":"5","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 June 2018","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improved Stabilization of Nonlinear DC Microgrids: Cubature Kalman Filter Approach","sourcePdf":"tia-pt2-vafamand-2848959-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.11951S","chronDate":"Sept.-Oct.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"28","isNumber":"8467516","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"28","citationCount":"31","xplore-issue":"8467516","articleId":"8388287","onlineDate":"19 June 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8388290,"authors":[{"name":"Wen-Qiang Jia","affiliation":["Department of Microwave, China Academy of Space Technology, Xi\u2019an, China"],"firstName":"Wen-Qiang","lastName":"Jia","orcid":"0000-0002-6979-7973","id":"37086423273"},{"name":"Hong-Xi Yu","affiliation":["Department of Microwave, China Academy of Space Technology, Xi\u2019an, China"],"firstName":"Hong-Xi","lastName":"Yu","orcid":"0000-0003-2375-6962","id":"37533943500"},{"name":"Fei Yang","affiliation":["Department of Microwave, China Academy of Space Technology, Xi\u2019an, China"],"firstName":"Fei","lastName":"Yang","id":"37538167300"},{"name":"Dawei Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Microwave, China Academy of Space Technology, Xi\u2019an, China"],"firstName":"Dawei","lastName":"Zhang","orcid":"0000-0001-6630-0872","id":"37085809472"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1531-1309"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-1764"}],"articleNumber":"8388290","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":745},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society","url":"http://www.mtt.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Broadband amplifiers","Impedance","Mathematical model","Bandwidth","Microwave circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["gallium compounds","III-V semiconductors","network synthesis","transmission lines","wideband amplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["broadband Doherty amplifier","efficiency enhancement","mathematical model","transmission line","Doherty output matching design"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Broadband Doherty","efficiency","GaN","linearity","quasi-lumped transmission line (TL)"]}],"abstract":"In this letter, a technique by distributing more power to the main amplifier of the Doherty amplifier is proposed to improve the overall efficiency of the back-off region for the first time.

The circuit measurement results prove that 44.3% fractional bandwidth is achieved, while drain efficiency within the frequency range at 6 dB back-off is greater than 59% with peak power output 46.5 dBm.","doi":"10.1109/LMWC.2018.2842684","publicationTitle":"IEEE Microwave and Wireless Components Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Microwave and Wireless Components Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/7260/8428547/08388290.pdf","startPage":"723","endPage":"725","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LMWC.2018.2842684","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8428547","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Broadband Doherty Amplifier With Back-Off Efficiency Enhancement","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8388290","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 June 2018","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8388290/","displayDocTitle":"A Broadband Doherty Amplifier With Back-Off Efficiency Enhancement","volume":"28","issue":"8","publicationDate":"Aug. 2018","accessionNumber":"17991295","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8388290/","dateOfInsertion":"07 August 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Broadband Doherty Amplifier With Back-Off Efficiency Enhancement","sourcePdf":"lmwc-jia-2842684-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.080389S","chronDate":"Aug.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"7260","isNumber":"8428547","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7260","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"8428547","articleId":"8388290","onlineDate":"19 June 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8388292,"authors":[{"name":"Agasthya Ayachit","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Wright State University, Dayton, OH, USA"],"firstName":"Agasthya","lastName":"Ayachit","orcid":"0000-0002-8532-6813","id":"38469582700"},{"name":"Marian K.

Each single-antenna user is equipped with a power splitter. Three crucial issues on resource management for this system include: 1) power-efficient improvement, 2) user-fairness guarantee, and 3) nonideal channel reciprocity effect mitigation. Potentially, a resource allocation scheme to address jointly such issues can be devised by using the framework of multiobjective optimization. However, the resulting problem might be complex to solve since the three issues hold different characteristics. Therefore, we propose a novel method to design the resource allocation scheme. In particular, the principle of our method relies on structuralizing mathematically the issues into a cross-layer multilevel optimization problem. On this basis, we then devise solving algorithms and closed-form solutions. Moreover, to instantly adapt the CSI changes in practice while reducing computational burdens, we propose a closed-form suboptimal solution to tackle the problem. Finally, we provide numerical results to show the achievable performance gains using the optimal and suboptimal solutions, and then validate the proposed resource allocation scheme.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2018.2848963","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/25/8466982/08388301.pdf","startPage":"8466","endPage":"8480","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8466982","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2018.2848963","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Resource Allocation in SWIPT Networks Under a Nonlinear Energy Harvesting Model: Power Efficiency, User Fairness, and Channel Nonreciprocity","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8388301","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2018","displayDocTitle":"Resource Allocation in SWIPT Networks Under a Nonlinear Energy Harvesting Model: Power Efficiency, User Fairness, and Channel Nonreciprocity","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8388301/","publicationDate":"Sept. 2018","dateOfInsertion":"17 September 2018","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"18095113","htmlLink":"/document/8388301/","volume":"67","issue":"9","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 June 2018","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000038","fundingName":"Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada","grantNumber":"435243\u20132013"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Resource Allocation in SWIPT Networks Under a Nonlinear Energy Harvesting Model: Power Efficiency, User Fairness, and Channel Nonreciprocity","sourcePdf":"tvt-tran-2848963-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.158115S","chronDate":"Sept.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"8466982","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"8466982","articleId":"8388301","onlineDate":"19 June 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8388310,"authors":[{"name":"Mehmet Tahir Ozden","affiliation":["Piri Reis Universitesi, Istanbul, TR"],"firstName":"Mehmet Tahir","lastName":"Ozden"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-4662-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-4663-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8388310","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":47},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Lattices","Cognitive radio","Program processors","Estimation error","Task analysis","Signal processing","Information technology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive filters","cognitive radio","filtering theory","lattice filters","least squares approximations","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiple adaptive lattice filters","sequential convex combinations","cognitive radio channel identification framework","sequential processing multichannel lattice stages","modified Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization","multiple filter combination task","regular filter structure","modular filter structure","exponential weighting factors","adaptive filter features","R-CMLF","D-CMLF","modified SPMLSs","decoupled combination of multiple lattice filters","regular combination of multiple lattice filters","multiple data channels","mean squared distortion performances","MSD performance","nonstationary conditions","stationary conditions","multiple combination of least mean square","M-CLMS","decoupled combination of least mean square scheme","D-CLMS schemes","low steady-state MSD levels"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cognitive radio","combining filters","channel identification","lattice filters","sequential processing"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8388310","doi":"10.1109/ISSPIT.2017.8388310","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Symposium on Signal Processing and Information Technology (ISSPIT)","abstract":"Sequential convex combinations of multiple adaptive lattice filters using different exponential weighting factors in cognitive radio channel identification framework have been considered in this presentation. First, the sequential processing multichannel lattice stages (SPMLSs) are modified so as to be used in filter combination task. Then, two different combination schemes, i.e., regular combination of multiple lattice filters (R-CMLF) and decoupled combination of multiple lattice filters (D-CMLF), that utilize modified SPMLSs as filter structure, have been proposed. A modified Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization of multiple channels of data, that is constituted in multiple filter combination task, is accomplished. A highly modular and regular filter structure, that is suitable for cognitive radios, is achieved with the combination processing implemented in an order-recursive fashion. The mean squared distortion (MSD) performances of the schemes under stationary and nonstationary conditions have been presented, and compared with the performances of multiple combination of least mean square (M-CLMS), decoupled combination of least mean square (D-CLMS) schemes, and individual filters. It has also been shown that the fault tolerances of the proposed schemes are better than component filters due to the redundancy introduced with combination processing, and that the proposed schemes bring together the desired adaptive filter features such as fast convergence and low steady-state MSD levels, which do not normally coexist.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISSPIT.2017.8388310","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8388305","startPage":"007","endPage":"012","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Symposium on Signal Processing and Information Technology (ISSPIT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8379924/8388305/08388310.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sequential combinations of multiple adaptive lattice filters in cognitive radio channel identification","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8388310/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-20 Dec. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8388310/","displayDocTitle":"Sequential combinations of multiple adaptive lattice filters in cognitive radio channel identification","conferenceDate":"18-20 Dec. 2017","publicationDate":"Dec. 2017","accessionNumber":"17859692","dateOfInsertion":"21 June 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sequential combinations of multiple adaptive lattice filters in cognitive radio channel identification","confLoc":"Bilbao, Spain","sourcePdf":"p7ozden.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.078183S","chronDate":"18-20 Dec. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8379924","isNumber":"8388305","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8379924","xplore-issue":"8388305","articleId":"8388310","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8388320,"authors":[{"name":"Zhilu Wu","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Information Engineering, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China"],"firstName":"Zhilu","lastName":"Wu","id":"37085489635"},{"name":"Yanlong Zhao","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Information Engineering, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China"],"firstName":"Yanlong","lastName":"Zhao","id":"37086406196"},{"name":"Zhendong Yin","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Information Engineering, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China"],"firstName":"Zhendong","lastName":"Yin","id":"37289711500"},{"name":"Haochen Luo","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Information Engineering, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China"],"firstName":"Haochen","lastName":"Luo","id":"37086406479"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-4662-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-4663-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8388320","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":639},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Jamming","Feature extraction","Interference","Narrowband","OFDM","Convolution","Training"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feedforward neural nets","jamming","signal classification"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["jamming signals classification","convolutional neural network","satellite communication links","deception jamming","suppression jamming","communication network interference","audio jamming","narrowband jamming","sweep jamming","communication link","automatic jamming signal classification method","pulse jamming","spectrum jamming","jamming noise rate","spread spectrum jamming"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8388320","abstract":"In the complex electromagnetic environment, satellite communication links will suffer kinds of interference and jamming, including deception jamming, suppression jamming, and communication network interference.

We use five types of jamming mode as input signals including audio jamming, narrowband jamming, pulse jamming, sweep jamming and spread spectrum jamming. Considering the characteristic of CNN, after verifying the feasibility of our method, it's easy to extend CNN training set and apply to more signals.

Lack of effective treatment can lead to vision impairment and even irreversible blindness. The disease can be diagnosed by examining digital color fundus photographs of retina. In this paper we propose deep learning approach to automated diabetic retinopathy screening. Deep convolutional neural networks (CNN) - the most popular kind of deep learning algorithms - enjoyed great success in the field of image analysis and recognition. Therefore, we leverage CNN networks to diagnose the diabetic retinopathy and its current stage, based on analysis of the photographs of retina. The utilized models were trained using dataset containing over 88000 retina photographs, labeled by specialist clinicians. To enhance the performance of the system, we proposed a special class coding technique that enabled to include the information about value of difference between predicted score and target score into the objective function being minimized during the neural networks training. To evaluate classification ability of employed models we used standard accuracy metrics and quadratic weighted Kappa score that is calculated between the predicted scores and scores provided in the dataset. The best tested model achieved an accuracy of about 82% in detecting the retinopathy and 51% in assessing its stage. Moreover, system obtained decent Kappa score equal 0.776. Achieved results showed that deep learning algorithms can be successfully employed to solve this very hard to analyze problem.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Deep CNN based decision support system for detection and assessing the stage of diabetic retinopathy","publicationTitle":"2018 International Interdisciplinary PhD Workshop (IIPhDW)","doi":"10.1109/IIPHDW.2018.8388337","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 International Interdisciplinary PhD Workshop (IIPhDW)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8381251/8388230/08388337.pdf","startPage":"111","endPage":"116","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IIPHDW.2018.8388337","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8388230","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8388337","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8388337/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-12 May 2018","displayDocTitle":"Deep CNN based decision support system for detection and assessing the stage of diabetic retinopathy","conferenceDate":"9-12 May 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8388337/","dateOfInsertion":"21 June 2018","publicationDate":"May 2018","accessionNumber":"17859911","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Deep CNN based decision support system for detection and assessing the stage of diabetic retinopathy","confLoc":"&#x15A;winou&#x15B;cie, Poland","sourcePdf":"039.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054373S","chronDate":"9-12 May 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8381251","isNumber":"8388230","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8381251","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"8388230","articleId":"8388337","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8388338,"authors":[{"name":"Agnieszka Miko\u0142ajczyk","affiliation":["Department of Control Systems Engineering, Gdansk University of Technology, Gdansk, Poland"],"firstName":"Agnieszka","lastName":"Miko\u0142ajczyk","id":"37085897344"},{"name":"Micha\u0142 Grochowski","affiliation":["Department of Control Systems Engineering, Gdansk University of Technology, Gdansk, Poland"],"firstName":"Micha\u0142","lastName":"Grochowski","id":"37085704280"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-6143-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-6142-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-6144-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8388338","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":95,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":9621},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image color analysis","Machine learning","Lesions","Image classification","Neural networks","Cancer","Task analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biomedical MRI","convolution","image classification","learning (artificial intelligence)","medical image processing","neural nets","skin"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["histopathological images","data augmentation","image classification problem","deep neural networks","DNN structures","image analysis","training data","image style transfer","deep learning","convolutional neural networks","learning algorithms","CNN","skin melanomas diagnosis","breast magnetic resonance imaging scans analysis","MRI","ML"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Machine learning","style transfer","data augmentation","deep learning","medical imaging"]}],"abstract":"These days deep learning is the fastest-growing field in the field of Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Neural Networks (DNN). Among many of DNN structures, the Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) are currently the main tool used for the image analysis and classification purposes. Although great achievements and perspectives, deep neural networks and accompanying learning algorithms have some relevant challenges to tackle. In this paper, we have focused on the most frequently mentioned problem in the field of machine learning, that is the lack of sufficient amount of the training data or uneven class balance within the datasets. One of the ways of dealing with this problem is so called data augmentation. In the paper we have compared and analyzed multiple methods of data augmentation in the task of image classification, starting from classical image transformations like rotating, cropping, zooming, histogram based methods and finishing at Style Transfer and Generative Adversarial Networks, along with the representative examples. Next, we presented our own method of data augmentation based on image style transfer. The method allows to generate the new images of high perceptual quality that combine the content of a base image with the appearance of another ones. The newly created images can be used to pre-train the given neural network in order to improve the training process efficiency. Proposed method is validated on the three medical case studies: skin melanomas diagnosis, histopathological images and breast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans analysis, utilizing the image classification in order to provide a diagnose. In such kind of problems the data deficiency is one of the most relevant issues. Finally, we discuss the advantages and disadvantages of the methods being analyzed.","doi":"10.1109/IIPHDW.2018.8388338","publicationTitle":"2018 International Interdisciplinary PhD Workshop (IIPhDW)","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 International Interdisciplinary PhD Workshop (IIPhDW)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8381251/8388230/08388338.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IIPHDW.2018.8388338","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8388230","startPage":"117","endPage":"122","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Data augmentation for improving deep learning in image classification problem","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8388338","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Data augmentation for improving deep learning in image classification problem","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-12 May 2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8388338/","conferenceDate":"9-12 May 2018","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2018","accessionNumber":"17859931","dateOfInsertion":"21 June 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8388338/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Data augmentation for improving deep learning in image classification problem","confLoc":"&#x15A;winou&#x15B;cie, Poland","sourcePdf":"040.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.08564S","chronDate":"9-12 May 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8381251","isNumber":"8388230","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8381251","citationCount":"95","xplore-issue":"8388230","articleId":"8388338","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-28"},{"_id":8388371,"authors":[{"name":"Wojciech Pietrowski","affiliation":["Institute of Electrical Engineering and Electronics, Poznan University of Technology, Poznan, Poland"],"firstName":"Wojciech","lastName":"Pietrowski","id":"37086133128"},{"name":"Konrad G\u00f3rny","affiliation":["Institute of Electrical Engineering and Electronics, Poznan University of Technology, Poznan, Poland"],"firstName":"Konrad","lastName":"G\u00f3rny","id":"37086125296"},{"name":"Grzegorz Wi\u015bniewski","affiliation":["Institute of Electrical Engineering and Electronics, Poznan University of Technology, Poznan, Poland"],"firstName":"Grzegorz","lastName":"Wi\u015bniewski","id":"37085595208"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-6143-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-6142-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-6144-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8388371","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":92},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8388371","abstract":"The paper presents a parallel computing algorithm with its implementation in software for diagnostic of line start permanent magnet synchronous motor (LSPMSM).

Based on this, a model was prepared that in response gives a recommendation for future increases. The system consists of two algorithms. The first of them uses the LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) artificial neural network. As inputs, information about the current closing price as well as technical analysis indicators along with the value of the current volume were used. The output has been specified as the closing price on the following day. In order to improve the response from the ANN (Artificial Neural Network), statistics of the occurrence of words in publications from last week were used. Subsequent signals gained much more importance if the volume of all transactions was much larger than the moving average of the last 15 periods and if the words that appeared in the last publication caused earlier increases. Additional information for the system are also data that come from Google Trends. This allows to verify the trend of interest and whether the published messages are important.","doi":"10.1109/IIPHDW.2018.8388375","publicationTitle":"2018 International Interdisciplinary PhD Workshop (IIPhDW)","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 International Interdisciplinary PhD Workshop (IIPhDW)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8381251/8388230/08388375.pdf","startPage":"288","endPage":"292","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8388230","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IIPHDW.2018.8388375","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Forward forecast of stock prices using LSTM neural networks with statistical analysis of published messages","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8388375/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-12 May 2018","displayDocTitle":"Forward forecast of stock prices using LSTM neural networks with statistical analysis of published messages","htmlLink":"/document/8388375/","dateOfInsertion":"21 June 2018","publicationDate":"May 2018","accessionNumber":"17859946","conferenceDate":"9-12 May 2018","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Forward forecast of stock prices using LSTM neural networks with statistical analysis of published messages","confLoc":"&#x15A;winou&#x15B;cie, Poland","sourcePdf":"090.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.078668S","chronDate":"9-12 May 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8381251","isNumber":"8388230","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8381251","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"8388230","articleId":"8388375","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8388393,"authors":[{"name":"Grzegorz Rybak","affiliation":["Institute of Applied Computer Science, Lodz University of Technology, L\u00f3d\u017e, Poland"],"firstName":"Grzegorz","lastName":"Rybak","id":"37086402394"},{"name":"Zbigniew Chaniecki","affiliation":["Institute of Applied Computer Science, Lodz University of Technology, L\u00f3d\u017e, Poland"],"firstName":"Zbigniew","lastName":"Chaniecki","id":"38197928300"},{"name":"Krzysztof Grudzie\u0144","affiliation":["Institute of Applied Computer Science, Lodz University of Technology, L\u00f3d\u017e, Poland"],"firstName":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Grudzie\u0144","id":"37284888700"},{"name":"Andrzej Romanowski","affiliation":["Institute of Applied Computer Science, Lodz University of Technology, L\u00f3d\u017e, Poland"],"firstName":"Andrzej","lastName":"Romanowski","id":"37949084400"},{"name":"Dominik Sankowski","affiliation":["Institute of Applied Computer Science, Lodz University of Technology, L\u00f3d\u017e, Poland"],"firstName":"Dominik","lastName":"Sankowski","id":"37284924000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-6143-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-6142-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-6144-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8388393","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":76},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Microsoft Windows","Iterative methods","Discrete Fourier transforms","Arrays","Feeds","Indexes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Fourier transforms","iterative methods","Java","optimisation","table lookup","tomography"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["unity lookup table","in-situ computing","bit-reversal permutation","feed forward method","metaprogramming approaches","Java programming language","iterative approach","twiddle factors","short-time Fourier transform algorithm","optimization methods","STFT","electrical capacitance tomography images processing"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Short-time Fourier transform","STFT","optimisation","feedforward","meta-programming","bit-reversal permutation","ECT"]}],"abstract":"The paper consists of well-known Fourier Transform algorithms review with its optimization methods.

In the light of the traditional signal acquisition process, Shannon sampling theorem need to be contented to prevent signal distortion, so the transmission of massive information requires large bandwidth. The timely and accurate transmission of real-time signal poses great challenges to multi-area power systems. This paper puts forward a novel signal processing means for the real-time reconstruction of multi-area power system signals via compressed sensing. Compressed sensing is an effective approach for acquiring compressed signals at a sampling rate remarkably below the Nyquist rate and accurately reconstructing signals from measurement vector. Multi-area power system signals needs to be sparsely transformed using sparse basis before being compressed. This paper uses an over-complete dictionary as the sparse basis.

Aiming at the shortcomings that minute load fluctuation is not considered, a new daily load curve forecasting using factor analysis and RBF neural network based on load segmentation is proposed. Based on the precise prediction of 288-point daily load curve, normalized load curve segmentation method is used to segment the original load curve which reduces the number of segments and the demand of samples. To reduce the dimension, factor analysis is utilized to develop a few and independent common factors which characterize common features of daily load curve. Considering the load correlation, the RBF neural network model is established for each common factor, and then the minute daily load curve can be restored from the forecasted common factors. Case studies based on the historical load data of the actual substation in Shantou are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.","doi":"10.1109/CIEEC.2017.8388514","startPage":"589","endPage":"594","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 China International Electrical and Energy Conference (CIEEC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8380352/8388404/08388514.pdf","publicationTitle":"2017 China International Electrical and Energy Conference (CIEEC)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CIEEC.2017.8388514","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8388404","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Daily load curve forecasting using factor analysis and RBF neural network based on load segmentation","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Fluctuations","Load forecasting","Loading","Forecasting","Correlation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["load forecasting","radial basis function networks","reactive power control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["factor analysis","load segmentation","load correlation","RBF neural network model","load fluctuation","daily load curve forecasting","power scheduling","power system","Shantou"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["daily load curve forecasting","factor analysis","normalized segmentation method","RBF neural network"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8388514/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-27 Oct. 2017","displayDocTitle":"Daily load curve forecasting using factor analysis and RBF neural network based on load segmentation","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8388514/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"21 June 2018","conferenceDate":"25-27 Oct. 2017","accessionNumber":"17859816","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Daily load curve forecasting using factor analysis and RBF neural network based on load segmentation","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"P290.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073027S","chronDate":"25-27 Oct. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8380352","isNumber":"8388404","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8380352","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8388404","articleId":"8388514","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-12"},{"_id":8388625,"authors":[{"name":"Miguel Heredia Conde","affiliation":["Universitat Siegen, Siegen, Nordrhein-Westfalen, DE"],"firstName":"Miguel Heredia","lastName":"Conde"},{"name":"Otmar Loffeld","affiliation":["Center for Sensorsystems (ZESS), University of Siegen, Siegen, Germany"],"firstName":"Otmar","lastName":"Loffeld","id":"37266868100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-4662-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-4663-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8388625","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":196},"abstract":"The advent of compressive sensing (CS) theory opened the possibility of linking the sensing effort, that is, the volume of data being produced by the sensor, to the amount of information it conveys, rather than to the desired sensor bandwidth, as traditional sampling theory suggests. Consequently, in the typical CS scenario, one ends up with a set of few measurements and the challenge is to recover a signal whose dimensionality is much higher than the number of measurements, typically under the assumption of being sparse.

Despite being ubiquitous in nature, finding the solution with lowest lo norm is known to be NP-hard. In this work we propose mimicking the nature to approach a solution. More specifically, we design a genetic algorithm (GA) that, despite being based on the rules of evolution of biological systems, is fully tailored to our specific problem. Adopting the terminology from genetics, our chromosomes are representations of different support configurations, with an associated restricted-support temporal solution. The fitness of each chromosome is measured in terms of reprojection error of the associated solution.

Thereby, herein this architecture is considered for the estimation of a correlated source vector in wireless sensor networks (WSN), where each sensor node amplifies and forwards its observation through a coherent Multiple Access Channel (MAC) channel. Namely, the fusion centre (FC) consists of a large number of distributed single antenna access points (AP) connected through a backhaul network to a central processing unit (CPU), where a Linear Minimum Mean Square Error (LMMSE) estimation is computed. Within this setting the exact and an approximated MSE, obtained by the LMMSE estimation, are derived. Bearing in mind these results, we address the design of the optimal power allocation, at each sensor node, to minimize the total transmitted power subject to an MSE estimation constraint. The approximation of the MSE paves the way to cast the optimal allocation problem as a Semidefinite Programming Problem (SDP). Finally, the numerical simulations show that our system permits to reduce significantly the total transmitted power compared to related work architectures proposing a massive MIMO system where all the antennas are collocated at the FC.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Distributed massive MIMO for estimation of a correlated source vector in sensor networks","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Symposium on Signal Processing and Information Technology (ISSPIT)","doi":"10.1109/ISSPIT.2017.8388635","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Symposium on Signal Processing and Information Technology (ISSPIT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8379924/8388305/08388635.pdf","startPage":"163","endPage":"167","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISSPIT.2017.8388635","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8388305","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8388635","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8388635/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-20 Dec. 2017","displayDocTitle":"Distributed massive MIMO for estimation of a correlated source vector in sensor networks","conferenceDate":"18-20 Dec. 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8388635/","dateOfInsertion":"21 June 2018","publicationDate":"Dec. 2017","accessionNumber":"17859699","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distributed massive MIMO for estimation of a correlated source vector in sensor networks","confLoc":"Bilbao, Spain","sourcePdf":"p163serra.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055951S","chronDate":"18-20 Dec. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8379924","isNumber":"8388305","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8379924","xplore-issue":"8388305","articleId":"8388635","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8388637,"authors":[{"name":"Roberto Hincapie","affiliation":["Universidad Pontificia Bolivariana Medell\u00edn, Colombia"],"firstName":"Roberto","lastName":"Hincapie","id":"37589376600"},{"name":"Cristina Gomez","affiliation":["Universidad Pontificia Bolivariana Medell\u00edn, Colombia"],"firstName":"Cristina","lastName":"Gomez","id":"37085481719"},{"name":"Leonardo Betancur","affiliation":["Universidad Pontificia Bolivariana Medell\u00edn, Colombia"],"firstName":"Leonardo","lastName":"Betancur","id":"37542858500"},{"name":"Anastasia Lavrenko","affiliation":["Inst. for Information Technology, Technische Universit\u00e4t Ilmenau, Ilmenau, Germany"],"firstName":"Anastasia","lastName":"Lavrenko","id":"37085370188"},{"name":"Johannes Schmitz","affiliation":["Inst. for Theoretical Inf.

We formulate the localization task as a joint block-sparse recovery problem and develop a framework that allows to accommodate different types of measures, such as the beamformer outputs in case of DoAs or cross-correlation functions in case of TDoAs. We then propose a reduced-size location recovery approach in which we perform multiple location estimations from partial combinations of measures that are later fused together. Our results indicate that in doing so we can achieve estimation performance superior to that of the fully joint recovery, while keeping a lower computational complexity.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8388637/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-20 Dec. 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"21 June 2018","accessionNumber":"17859706","htmlLink":"/document/8388637/","conferenceDate":"18-20 Dec. 2017","displayDocTitle":"Sparse framework for hybrid TDoA/DoA multiple emitter localization","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sparse framework for hybrid TDoA/DoA multiple emitter localization","confLoc":"Bilbao, Spain","sourcePdf":"p174hincapie.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065057S","chronDate":"18-20 Dec. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8379924","isNumber":"8388305","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8379924","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8388305","articleId":"8388637","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8388638,"authors":[{"name":"Hasan Abu Hilal","affiliation":["Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Higher College of Technology, Abu Dhabi - UAE"],"firstName":"Hasan Abu","lastName":"Hilal"},{"name":"Tariq Abu Hilal","affiliation":["Computer Information Sciences, Higher College of Technology, Abu Dhabi - UAE"],"firstName":"Tariq Abu","lastName":"Hilal"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-4662-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-4663-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8388638","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":111},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Peak to average power ratio","Signal to noise ratio","AWGN","Information technology","Uplink"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["3G mobile communication","4G mobile communication","frequency division multiple access","Gaussian channels","Gaussian noise","impulse noise","Long Term Evolution","OFDM modulation","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["impulsive noise","common noise models","wireless channels","wireless systems detection devices","SCFDMA PAPR","noise channel","single carrier frequency division multiple access","cellular systems","uplink multiple access scheme","SCFDA system","orthogonal frequency division multiple access","4G OFDM","nonGaussian noise channel","high data rate uplink communications","peak-to-average power ratio","Long Term Evolution","LTE","Third Generation Partnership Project","3GPP","throughput performance"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Non Gaussian noise","Wireless Channels","OFDM and SCFDMA"]}],"abstract":"Non-Gaussian noise is one of the most common noise models observed in wireless channels. This type of noise has severe impact on wireless systems detection devices. In this paper, the issue of OFDM and SCFDMA PAPR in non-Gaussian noise channel is addressed. Single carrier frequency division multiple access (SCFDMA) is developed form the Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple access, (OFDM), and is a promising technique for high data rate uplink communications in the cellular systems. SCFDMA has similar throughput performance and essentially the same overall complexity as OFDM. One of the most important advantages of SCFDMA is the peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR), which is lower than that of OFDM. SCFDMA is employed in the uplink multiple access scheme in the Long Term Evolution (LTE) of cellular systems, and identified by the Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP). In this paper, we show the performance differences of the OFDM and SCFDA system under different noise scenarios. The performance measure is the PAPR.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Impact of impulsive noise on 4G OFDM and SCFDMA systems","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Symposium on Signal Processing and Information Technology (ISSPIT)","doi":"10.1109/ISSPIT.2017.8388638","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Symposium on Signal Processing and Information Technology (ISSPIT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8379924/8388305/08388638.pdf","startPage":"180","endPage":"185","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISSPIT.2017.8388638","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8388305","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8388638","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8388638/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-20 Dec. 2017","displayDocTitle":"Impact of impulsive noise on 4G OFDM and SCFDMA systems","conferenceDate":"18-20 Dec. 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8388638/","dateOfInsertion":"21 June 2018","publicationDate":"Dec. 2017","accessionNumber":"17859682","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Impact of impulsive noise on 4G OFDM and SCFDMA systems","confLoc":"Bilbao, Spain","sourcePdf":"p180abuhilal.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.034393S","chronDate":"18-20 Dec. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8379924","isNumber":"8388305","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8379924","xplore-issue":"8388305","articleId":"8388638","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8388645,"authors":[{"name":"Alastair Turl","affiliation":["School of Computer Science, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, UK"],"firstName":"Alastair","lastName":"Turl","id":"37086405777"},{"name":"Ata Kab\u00e1n","affiliation":["School of Computer Science, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, UK"],"firstName":"Ata","lastName":"Kab\u00e1n","id":"37418754200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-4662-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-4663-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8388645","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":42},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optimization","Mathematical model","Estimation","Quantization (signal)","Minimization","Information technology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["blind source separation","convex programming"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["time disjoint sources","clipping distortion","clipped mixtures","convex optimization problem","clipping geometry","blind source separation"]}],"abstract":"Source separation remains a challenging problem, made even more challenging when the mixtures are distorted.

We report that error in the delay estimator is generally less than 5% of a sample, when the true delay is up to 10 samples for three source mixtures.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Tiled time delay estimation in mobile cloud computing environments","doi":"10.1109/ISSPIT.2017.8388656","startPage":"282","endPage":"287","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISSPIT.2017.8388656","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8388305","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Symposium on Signal Processing and Information Technology (ISSPIT)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Symposium on Signal Processing and Information Technology (ISSPIT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8379924/8388305/08388656.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8388656","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8388656/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-20 Dec. 2017","displayDocTitle":"Tiled time delay estimation in mobile cloud computing environments","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8388656/","dateOfInsertion":"21 June 2018","publicationDate":"Dec. 2017","accessionNumber":"17859724","conferenceDate":"18-20 Dec. 2017","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Tiled time delay estimation in mobile cloud computing environments","confLoc":"Bilbao, Spain","sourcePdf":"p282defrein.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06261S","chronDate":"18-20 Dec. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8379924","isNumber":"8388305","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8379924","xplore-issue":"8388305","articleId":"8388656","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8388658,"authors":[{"name":"Miguel Heredia Conde","affiliation":["Universitat Siegen, Siegen, Nordrhein-Westfalen, DE"],"firstName":"Miguel Heredia","lastName":"Conde","id":"37085521139"},{"name":"Dunja Hage","affiliation":["Center for Sensorsystems (ZESS), University of Siegen, Siegen, Germany"],"firstName":"Dunja","lastName":"Hage","id":"37086408077"},{"name":"Otmar Loffeld","affiliation":["Center for Sensorsystems (ZESS), University of Siegen, Siegen, Germany"],"firstName":"Otmar","lastName":"Loffeld","id":"37266868100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-4662-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-4663-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8388658","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":62},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8388658","abstract":"Compressive sensing (CS) theory enables linking the sensing effort, that is, the volume of data that a sensor produces, to the amount of information this data conveys, rather than to the desired bandwidth, as prescribed by classical sampling theory. As a consequence, in the typical CS scenario, one ends up with a set of m measurements and the objective is to recover a signal whose dimensionality is n \u226b m, typically under the assumption of being sparse. Recovering the sparsest solution that satisfies the measurements is an NP-hard problem and a common workaround is relaxing it to a linearly-constrained l\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">i</sub>\n minimization. In this work we introduce a novel algorithm for solving this problem that exhibits the structure of a genetic algorithm, but fully operates in null-space domain. This allows reducing the dimensionality of the chromosomes to the minimum, i. e., n-m. Crossover follows a deterministic scheme, with adjustable number of parents and children per pairing. Furthermore, mutations are not random, but guided along the direction of the negative gradient of the fitness function. Numerical simulation revealed that the proposed algorithm performs better than comparable alternatives in terms of reconstruction error when the number of iterations is to be kept very low. This, together with its high parallelization potential, paves the way for faster CS reconstruction.","doi":"10.1109/ISSPIT.2017.8388658","startPage":"294","endPage":"299","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Symposium on Signal Processing and Information Technology (ISSPIT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8379924/8388305/08388658.pdf","publicationTitle":"2017 IEEE International Symposium on Signal Processing and Information Technology (ISSPIT)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISSPIT.2017.8388658","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8388305","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A null-space-based genetic algorithm for constrained l<inf>1</inf> minimization","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Genetic algorithms","Biological cells","Sensors","Signal processing algorithms","Sociology","Statistics","Minimization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compressed sensing","computational complexity","genetic algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compressive sensing theory","null-space-based genetic algorithm","linearly-constrained li minimization","deterministic scheme","fitness function","high parallelization potential","mutations","NP-hard problem","sparsest solution","classical sampling theory","sensing effort","faster CS reconstruction","dimensionality","null-space domain"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8388658/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-20 Dec. 2017","displayDocTitle":"A null-space-based genetic algorithm for constrained l<inf>1</inf> minimization","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8388658/","publicationDate":"Dec. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"21 June 2018","conferenceDate":"18-20 Dec. 2017","accessionNumber":"17859671","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A null-space-based genetic algorithm for constrained l<inf>1</inf> minimization","confLoc":"Bilbao, Spain","sourcePdf":"p294herediaconde.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.078836S","chronDate":"18-20 Dec. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8379924","isNumber":"8388305","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8379924","xplore-issue":"8388305","articleId":"8388658","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-12"},{"_id":8388661,"authors":[{"name":"Amr A.

reduced complexity MFCC-based deep neural network approach for speech enhancement","abstract":"This paper focuses on a regression-based deep neural network (DNN) approach for single-channel speech enhancement. While DNN can lead to improved speech quality compared to classical approaches, it is afflicted by high computational complexity in the training stage. The main contribution of this work is to reduce the DNN complexity by introducing a spectral feature mapping from noisy mel frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCC) to enhanced short-time Fourier transform (STFT) spectrum. This approach requires much fewer input features and consequently lead to reduced DNN complexity. Exploiting the frequency domain speech features obtained from this mapping also avoids the information loss in reconstructing the speech signal back to time domain from its MFCC. Compared to the STFT-based DNN approach, the complexity of our approach for the training phase is reduced by a factor of 4.75. Moreover, experimental results of perceptual evaluation of speech quality (PESQ) and source-to-distortion ratio (SDR) show that the proposed approach outperforms the benchmark algorithms and this for various noise types, and different SNR levels.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8388664/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-20 Dec. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"21 June 2018","publicationDate":"Dec. 2017","accessionNumber":"17859732","htmlLink":"/document/8388664/","conferenceDate":"18-20 Dec. 2017","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A reduced complexity MFCC-based deep neural network approach for speech enhancement","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A reduced complexity MFCC-based deep neural network approach for speech enhancement","confLoc":"Bilbao, Spain","sourcePdf":"p331razani.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062338S","chronDate":"18-20 Dec. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8379924","isNumber":"8388305","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8379924","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"8388305","articleId":"8388664","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":8388669,"authors":[{"name":"Anderson R.

A new modulation spectral feature pooling scheme is proposed to mitigate the detrimental effects of background noise. On top of these features, two DNN-based architectures are tested for the prediction of arousal and valence emotional primitives: a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) and a recurrent neural network based on Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM). Experiments are conducted using the RECOLA dataset of spontaneous interactions. In order to simulate data collected in-the-wild, the clean speech files were corrupted with different levels of background noise and room impulse responses collected using a mobile device. Both stationary and non-stationary noise types (fan and babble) were considered in our experiments. Three distinct scenarios were explored: noise only, reverberation only and noise-plus-reverberation. Experimental results have shown that, in most of the scenarios, the proposed SER system achieved better performance in terms of concordance correlation coefficients (CCC) compared to the benchmark algorithm described in the 2016 Audio/Visual Emotion Challenge. The proposed feature system also showed to be more robust when noise-plus-reverberation is considered.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-20 Dec. 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8388669/","accessionNumber":"17859739","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8388669/","publicationDate":"Dec. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"21 June 2018","conferenceDate":"18-20 Dec. 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Speech emotion recognition on mobile devices based on modulation spectral feature pooling and deep neural networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Speech emotion recognition on mobile devices based on modulation spectral feature pooling and deep neural networks","confLoc":"Bilbao, Spain","sourcePdf":"p360avila.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061224S","chronDate":"18-20 Dec. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8379924","isNumber":"8388305","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8379924","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"8388305","articleId":"8388669","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-12"},{"_id":8388678,"authors":[{"name":"Abdullah-Al Nahid","affiliation":["School of Engineering, Macquarie University, Sydney, Australia"],"firstName":"Abdullah-Al","lastName":"Nahid","id":"37086272419"},{"name":"Mohamad Ali Mehrabi","affiliation":["Macquarie University, Sydney, NSW, AU"],"firstName":"Mohamad Ali","lastName":"Mehrabi","id":"37703623800"},{"name":"Yinan Kong","affiliation":["School of Engineering, Macquarie University, Sydney, Australia"],"firstName":"Yinan","lastName":"Kong","id":"37287137100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-4662-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-4663-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8388678","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":181},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Discrete cosine transforms","Cancer","Biomedical imaging","Biological system modeling","Logic gates","Data models","Frequency-domain analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cancer","image classification","medical image processing","recurrent neural nets","statistical analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image dataset","raw images","frequency-domain information","GRU methods","histopathological breast-image classification","biomedical image classification","deep neural network","long short term memory","LSTM methods","advanced engineering","gated recurrent unit","DNN"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Breast Cancer","DFT","DCT","GRU","LSTM"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8388678","abstract":"Biomedical image classification has always been a challenging and critical task which has the highest level of importance.

A low power embedded implementation of the method, which combines the asynchronous time-based image sensor with IBM's TrueNorth Neurosynaptic System, is presented. The sensor generates spikes with submillisecond resolution in response to scene illumination changes. These spike are processed by a spiking neural network running on TrueNorth with a 1-ms resolution to accurately determine the order and time difference of spikes from neighbouring pixels, and therefore infer the velocity. The spiking neural network is a variant of the Barlow Levick method for optical flow estimation. The system is evaluated on two recordings for which ground truth motion is available, and achieves an average endpoint error of 11% at an estimated power budget of under 80 mW for the sensor and computation.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Spiking Optical Flow for Event-Based Sensors Using IBM's TrueNorth Neurosynaptic System","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Circuits and Systems","doi":"10.1109/TBCAS.2018.2834558","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/4156126/8436463/08388703.pdf","startPage":"860","endPage":"870","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TBCAS.2018.2834558","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8436463","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8388703","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8388703/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 June 2018","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2018","displayDocTitle":"Spiking Optical Flow for Event-Based Sensors Using IBM's TrueNorth Neurosynaptic System","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"12","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/8388703/","dateOfInsertion":"14 August 2018","publicationDate":"Aug. 2018","accessionNumber":"18001050","pubMedId":"29994132","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spiking Optical Flow for Event-Based Sensors Using IBM's TrueNorth Neurosynaptic System","sourcePdf":"tbcas-haessig-2834558-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.066745S","chronDate":"Aug.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"4156126","isNumber":"8436463","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4156126","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"8436463","articleId":"8388703","onlineDate":"19 June 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8388706,"authors":[{"name":"Yanping Xiao","affiliation":["National Key Laboratory of Science and Technology on Communications, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/8274985/8388706/xiao-2849098-small.gif","p":["Yanping Xiao received the B.S. degree in communication engineering from the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China in 2015, where she is currently pursuing the M.S. degree with the National Key Laboratory of Science and Technology on Communications.

However, conventional DM approaches cannot guarantee the transmission security when eavesdroppers are located close to the legitimate user. In this paper, to mitigate this problem, a new DM scheme with cooperative receivers (DM-CR) is proposed for secrecy communications. Specifically, the legitimate user employs multiple cooperative receivers, and a predefined distortion factor set is introduced to the beamforming vector. The proposed DM-CR scheme is able to guarantee transmission security regardless of the direction or location of the eavesdroppers. Furthermore, the average bit error probability of the proposed DM-CR scheme is investigated. Both analytical and simulation results are presented to show that the proposed DM-CR scheme significantly outperforms the benchmark in terms of the bit error rate, so as to provide secure transmission toward future wireless communications.","topic":"Secure Modulations for Future Wireless Communications and Mobile

To this end, several methods have been developed to predict the new location of the moving Pareto set (PS) so that the population can be reinitialized around the predicted location. In this paper, we present a multidirectional prediction strategy to enhance the performance of EAs in solving a dynamic multiobjective optimization problem (DMOP). To more accurately predict the moving location of the PS, the population is clustered into a number of representative groups by a proposed classification strategy, where the number of clusters is adapted according to the intensity of the environmental change. To examine the performance of the developed algorithm, the proposed prediction strategy is compared with four state-of-the-art prediction methods under the framework of particle swarm optimization as well as five popular EAs for dynamic multiobjective optimization. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can effectively tackle DMOPs.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8388721/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 June 2018","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2019","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","publicationDate":"Sept. 2019","accessionNumber":"18756863","pubMedId":"29994141","htmlLink":"/document/8388721/","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 June 2019","volume":"49","issue":"9","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Multidirectional Prediction Approach for Dynamic Multiobjective Optimization Problems","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61473299, 61573361 and 61773384"},{"fundingName":"National Key Research and Development Program of China","grantNumber":"2018YFB1003802-01"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100012166","fundingName":"National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program)","grantNumber":"2014CB046306-2"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multidirectional Prediction Approach for Dynamic Multiobjective Optimization Problems","sourcePdf":"tcyb-rong-2842158-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.125316S","chronDate":"Sept.  2019","xplore-pub-id":"6221036","isNumber":"8732614","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6221036","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"8732614","articleId":"8388721","onlineDate":"19 June 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8388723,"authors":[{"name":"Yusuke Yano","affiliation":["Graduate School of Natural Science and Technology, Okayama University, Okayama, Japan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/15/8798899/8388723/yano-2841424-small.gif","p":["Yusuke Yano received the B.S. degree in communication and network engineering and the M.S. degree in electronic and information systems engineering from Okayama University, Okayama, Japan, in 2010 and 2012, respectively.

The Q factor of the resonance is used as the design criteria. Optimum snubber parameters are determined analytically and uniquely by using a simplified equivalent circuit of the resonant loop and deriving an analytical formula for the Q factor as a function of the snubber parameters. The optimally designed snubbers can adequately adjust the Q factor to any design target. They can also minimize the increases in the negative effects of the snubbers, i.e., overshoot and power loss. The method was applied to RL and RC snubbers to be added to a synchronous buck converter. The effects of the snubbers were reproduced by simulation program with integrated circuit emphasis (SPICE) simulation to validate the method from the perspective of resonance damping, overshoot, and power loss. The results showed that the damping effects obtained with the optimized snubbers met the Q factor design targets. They also demonstrate that the parameters are optimum in terms of suppressing overshoot and power loss. These results indicate that the method is suitable for optimizing RL and RC snubbers to damp parasitic LC resonance.","doi":"10.1109/TEMC.2018.2841424","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TEMC.2018.2841424","startPage":"1217","endPage":"1225","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electromagnetic Compatibility","pdfPath":"/iel7/15/8798899/08388723.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electromagnetic Compatibility","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8798899","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Method for Optimally Designing Snubber Circuits for Buck Converter Circuits to Damp <i>LC</i> Resonance","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 June 2018","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2019","displayDocTitle":"A Method for Optimally Designing Snubber Circuits for Buck Converter Circuits to Damp <i>LC</i> Resonance","publicationDate":"Aug. 2019","dateOfInsertion":"14 August 2019","volume":"61","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8388723/","accessionNumber":"18905327","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8388723/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Method for Optimally Designing Snubber Circuits for Buck Converter Circuits to Damp <italic>LC</italic> Resonance","sourcePdf":"temc-pt1-yano-2841424-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.07736S","chronDate":"Aug.  2019","xplore-pub-id":"15","isNumber":"8798899","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"15","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"8798899","articleId":"8388723","onlineDate":"19 June 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":8388726,"authors":[{"name":"Jianping Weng","affiliation":["Institute for Network Sciences and Cyberspace, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/90/8438336/8388726/weng-2843805-small.gif","p":["Jianping Weng received the B.Sc. degree from the Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications in 2015 and the M.Sc. degree from Tsinghua University in 2018.

If the performance of a multitier service degrades, we need to find out the root causes precisely to recover the service as soon as possible. In this paper, we argue that the cloud providers are in a better position than the tenants to solve this problem, and the solution should be non-intrusive to tenants' services or applications. Based on these two considerations, we propose a solution for cloud providers to help tenants to localize root causes of any anomaly. With the help of our solution, cloud operators can find out root causes of any anomaly no matter the root causes are in the same tenant as the anomaly or from other tenants. Particularly, we elaborate a non-intrusive method to capture the dependency relationships of components, which improves the feasibility. During localization, we exploit measurement data of both application layer and underlay infrastructure, and our two-step localization algorithm also includes a random walk procedure to model anomaly propagation probability. These techniques improve the accuracy of our root causes localization. Our small-scale real-world experiments and large-scale simulation experiments show a 15%-71% improvement in mean average precision compared with the current methods in different scenarios.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Root Cause Analysis of Anomalies of Multitier Services in Public Clouds","publicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on

The data-retention lifetime of 3D-TLC NAND flash memory is extended by 700-times to achieve over 10-year lifetime of IoT edge devices such as automobiles and infrastructures. Proposed SSD combines reliability enhancement techniques for 3D-TLC NAND flash memories with unique characteristics of DNN weights, which have values of near 0. This paper proposes two techniques for SSD controller. The 1st proposal, One-State Error Recovery, removes all of 1-state errors of important bits in DNN weights even when error-correcting code (ECC) cannot correct errors. The 2nd proposal, DNN Weight Data Mapping, assigns frequently used \"0\" to the highly reliable VTH-state of memory cells. Due to error tolerance of DNN weights, acceptable bit error rate (BER) increases by 9.8-times.","doi":"10.1109/IMW.2018.8388776","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IMW.2018.8388776","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","publicationTitle":"2018 IEEE International Memory Workshop (IMW)","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 IEEE International Memory Workshop (IMW)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8385224/8388765/08388776.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8388765","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"3D-NAND Flash Solid-State Drive (SSD) for Deep Neural Network Weight Storage of IoT Edge Devices with 700x Data-Retention Lifetime Extention","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8388776/","conferenceDate":"13-16 May 2018","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 May 2018","displayDocTitle":"3D-NAND Flash Solid-State Drive (SSD) for Deep Neural Network Weight Storage of IoT Edge Devices with 700x Data-Retention Lifetime Extention","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"21 June 2018","accessionNumber":"17874459","publicationDate":"May 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8388776/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"3D-NAND Flash Solid-State Drive (SSD) for Deep Neural Network Weight Storage of IoT Edge Devices with 700x Data-Retention Lifetime Extention","confLoc":"Kyoto, Japan","sourcePdf":"pid1211608.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.128771S","chronDate":"13-16 May 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8385224","isNumber":"8388765","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8385224","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"8388765","articleId":"8388776","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8388777,"authors":[{"name":"Igor Kouznetsov","affiliation":["Cypress Semiconductor, San Jose, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Igor","lastName":"Kouznetsov","id":"37566102500"},{"name":"Krishnaswamy Ramkumar","affiliation":["Cypress Semiconductor, San Jose, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Krishnaswamy","lastName":"Ramkumar","id":"37266021400"},{"name":"Venkatraman Prabhakar","affiliation":["Cypress Semiconductor, San Jose, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Venkatraman","lastName":"Prabhakar","id":"37073261500"},{"name":"Long Hinh","affiliation":["Cypress Semiconductor, San Jose, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Long","lastName":"Hinh","id":"37268815500"},{"name":"H.M.

The 16Gb MRAM and 32Gb ReRAM show negligible refresh power (<;1mW) when retention time is longer than 100s.","doi":"10.1109/IMW.2018.8388780","publicationTitle":"2018 IEEE International Memory Workshop (IMW)","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 IEEE International Memory Workshop (IMW)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8385224/8388765/08388780.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IMW.2018.8388780","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8388765","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Comprehensive Study on DDR4 MRAM and ReRAM Power Estimation Using a Parameterized NVM Power Calculator","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"13-16 May 2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8388780/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 May 2018","displayDocTitle":"A Comprehensive Study on DDR4 MRAM and ReRAM Power Estimation Using a Parameterized NVM Power Calculator","dateOfInsertion":"21 June 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8388780/","accessionNumber":"17861151","publicationDate":"May 2018","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Comprehensive Study on DDR4 MRAM and ReRAM Power Estimation Using a Parameterized NVM Power Calculator","confLoc":"Kyoto, Japan","sourcePdf":"pid1212152.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057654S","chronDate":"13-16 May 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8385224","isNumber":"8388765","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8385224","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"8388765","articleId":"8388780","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8388781,"authors":[{"name":"Toshitsugu Sakamoto","affiliation":["NEC Corporation, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan"],"firstName":"Toshitsugu","lastName":"Sakamoto","id":"37275852400"},{"name":"Yukihide Tsuji","affiliation":["NEC Corporation, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan"],"firstName":"Yukihide","lastName":"Tsuji","id":"37410797400"},{"name":"Xu Bai","affiliation":["NEC Corporation, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan"],"firstName":"Xu","lastName":"Bai","id":"37085718423"},{"name":"Makoto Miyamura","affiliation":["Nihon Denki Kabushiki Kaisha, Minato-ku, Tokyo, JP"],"firstName":"Makoto","lastName":"Miyamura"},{"name":"Ayuka Morioka","affiliation":["NEC Corporation, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan"],"firstName":"Ayuka","lastName":"Morioka","id":"37297621700"},{"name":"Ryusuke Nebashi","affiliation":["NEC Corporation, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan"],"firstName":"Ryusuke","lastName":"Nebashi","id":"37294561200"},{"name":"Naoki Banno","affiliation":["NEC Corporation, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan"],"firstName":"Naoki","lastName":"Banno","id":"37394478200"},{"name":"Koichiro Okamoto","affiliation":["NEC Corporation, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan"],"firstName":"Koichiro","lastName":"Okamoto","id":"37537803500"},{"name":"Noriyuki Iguchi","affiliation":["NEC Corporation, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan"],"firstName":"Noriyuki","lastName":"Iguchi","id":"37385488900"},{"name":"Hiromitsu Hada","affiliation":["NEC Corporation, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan"],"firstName":"Hiromitsu","lastName":"Hada","id":"37294548900"},{"name":"Tadahiko Sugibayashi","affiliation":["NEC Corporation, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan"],"firstName":"Tadahiko","lastName":"Sugibayashi","id":"37300124900"},{"name":"Munehiro Tada","affiliation":["NEC Corporation, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan"],"firstName":"Munehiro","lastName":"Tada","id":"37272858100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-5247-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-5248-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2573-7503"}],"articleNumber":"8388781","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":147},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8388781","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Switches","Field programmable gate arrays","Electrodes","Nonvolatile memory","Routing","Energy efficiency","Random access memory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["copper","field programmable gate arrays","Internet of Things","low-power electronics","random-access storage","switches","system-on-chip"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["improved cycle endurance","nonvolatile SoC","multiusage atom switch","nonvolatile routing switch","nonvolatile memory","ultra-low power SoC","IoT applications","electric field enhancement","nonvolatile FPGA macro","NVM macro","single SoC","copper electrode structure","time 10 year","Cu"]}],"abstract":"Multi-usage atom switch as \"nonvolatile routing switch in FPGA\" and \"nonvolatile memory (NVM)\" is newly developed for ultra-low power SoC in IoT applications.

Millimeter-wave radiometer is a high-sensitivity noise power receiver that can detect the microwave radiation from objects. Millimeter wave radiometer is one of the key technologies in millimeter wave passive detection and imaging. The novel system this paper proposed using compressed sensing is a focal plane system, which simultaneously receives signals through multiple feeds. Each feed receives the corresponding pixel point of millimeter wave radiation energy. The system achieves the similar function of the dam-board by on-off the switch. The system reduces the number of receiver channels via the use of compressed sensing. The proposed system not only overcomes the shortcomings of the traditional systems, but also recovers the image according to the theory of compressed sensing. The system performance is validated through simulations.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Simulations of novel radiometer systems using compressed sensing","publicationTitle":"2017 9th International Conference on Advanced Infocomm Technology (ICAIT)","doi":"10.1109/ICAIT.2017.8388817","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 9th International Conference on Advanced Infocomm Technology (ICAIT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8379735/8388809/08388817.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICAIT.2017.8388817","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8388809","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8388817","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8388817/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 Nov. 2017","displayDocTitle":"Simulations of novel radiometer systems using compressed sensing","conferenceDate":"22-24 Nov. 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8388817/","dateOfInsertion":"21 June 2018","publicationDate":"Nov. 2017","accessionNumber":"17858948","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Simulations of novel radiometer systems using compressed sensing","confLoc":"Chengdu, China","sourcePdf":"07T023ICAIT.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041023S","chronDate":"22-24 Nov. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8379735","isNumber":"8388809","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8379735","xplore-issue":"8388809","articleId":"8388817","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8388821,"authors":[{"name":"Liu Zhen","affiliation":["Electronics Department, Engineering University of the Armed Police Force, Xi\u2019 an, China"],"firstName":"Liu","lastName":"Zhen","id":"37086398430"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-3628-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"DVD ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-3626-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-3629-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8388821","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":70},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Compressed sensing","Galois fields","Sparse matrices","Encryption","Lattices"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compressed sensing","public key cryptography"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["public key encryption scheme","compressed sensing","concrete CSPKE algorithm","lattice-based cryptography"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["component","data collection security","encryption algorithm","compressed sensing","LWE hypothesis","quantum attack resistant"]}],"abstract":"In order to improve the security of Compressed Sensing, this paper put forward a new idea-Compressed Sensing Public Key Encryption (CSPKE), realized a concrete CSPKE algorithm by combing Lattice-based Cryptography with Compressed Sensing, and proved its security of indistinguishability against chosen plaintext attack (IND-CPA) on standard model based on Learning With Error (LWE) assumptions.

DRAM operated at a temperature between room temperature and the temperature of the CPU might be one possible memory solution. To utilize DRAM at cryogenic temperatures, understanding of its retention behavior is required. We have tested the functionality and retention behavior of unmodified commercially available DRAM parts at temperatures between 360K and 77K. All parts are functional in the temperature range. The retention time increases strongly when reducing the temperature from 360K to a temperature between 260K and 290K. At lower temperatures, all devices except one continue to show a small number of single cell retention fails. Activation energy analysis shows that the main distribution of retention are junction and subthreshold leakage. The residual fails occurring down to 77K are likely due to a tunneling process like gate-induced-drain leakage (GIDL). The number of these residual fails is small enough that redundancy or error correcting codes will make the use of DRAM at temperatures down to 77K feasible.","doi":"10.1109/IMW.2018.8388826","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IMW.2018.8388826","publicationTitle":"2018 IEEE International Memory Workshop (IMW)","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 IEEE International Memory Workshop (IMW)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8385224/8388765/08388826.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8388765","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"DRAM Retention at Cryogenic Temperatures","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8388826/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 May 2018","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"DRAM Retention at Cryogenic Temperatures","conferenceDate":"13-16 May 2018","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"21 June 2018","publicationDate":"May 2018","accessionNumber":"17861121","htmlLink":"/document/8388826/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"DRAM Retention at Cryogenic Temperatures","confLoc":"Kyoto, Japan","sourcePdf":"pid1212148.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.036055S","chronDate":"13-16 May 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8385224","isNumber":"8388765","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8385224","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"8388765","articleId":"8388826","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8388827,"authors":[{"name":"Marinela Barci","affiliation":["Dep. of Electrical Engineering, KU Leuven, Leuven, Belgium"],"firstName":"Marinela","lastName":"Barci","id":"37085431765"},{"name":"Andrea Fantini","affiliation":["Imec, Leuven, Belgium"],"firstName":"Andrea","lastName":"Fantini","id":"37270602400"},{"name":"Augusto Redolfi","affiliation":["Imec, Leuven, Belgium"],"firstName":"Augusto","lastName":"Redolfi","id":"38483626400"},{"name":"Shreya Kundu","affiliation":["Imec, Leuven, Belgium"],"firstName":"Shreya","lastName":"Kundu","id":"37086172097"},{"name":"Attilio Belmonte","affiliation":["Imec, Leuven, Belgium"],"firstName":"Attilio","lastName":"Belmonte","id":"37944533000"},{"name":"Wouter Devulder","affiliation":["Imec, Leuven, Belgium"],"firstName":"Wouter","lastName":"Devulder","id":"37085682033"},{"name":"Karl Opsomer","affiliation":["Interuniversitair Micro-Elektronica Centrum, Leuven, Vlaams-Brabant, BE"],"firstName":"Karl","lastName":"Opsomer","id":"37294032300"},{"name":"Romain Delhougne","affiliation":["Interuniversitair Micro-Elektronica Centrum, Leuven, Vlaams-Brabant, BE"],"firstName":"Romain","lastName":"Delhougne","id":"37322808300"},{"name":"Ludovic Goux","affiliation":["Imec, Leuven, Belgium"],"firstName":"Ludovic","lastName":"Goux","id":"37293864600"},{"name":"Gouri Sankar Kar","affiliation":["Imec, Leuven, Belgium"],"firstName":"Gouri","lastName":"Sankar Kar","id":"37088086320"},{"name":"Thomas Witters","affiliation":["Imec, Leuven, Belgium"],"firstName":"Thomas","lastName":"Witters","id":"37268114400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-5247-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-5248-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2573-7503"}],"articleNumber":"8388827","dbTime":"33 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":257},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Engineering and Stack Optimization of Cu -Based Selector Devices for Low Power SCM Applications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8388827","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hafnium compounds","Switches","Electrodes","Voltage measurement","Bridge circuits","Standards"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["copper","germanium compounds","integrated circuit reliability","leakage currents","random-access storage"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Cu-based selector devices","VCB nonlinearity","HfO2-Cu-based stacks","good switching temperature stability","good endurance behavior","initial current leakage","interfacial layer","standard stack","material properties","volatile conductive bridge concept","unipolar selector","low power SCM applications","stack optimization","current 1.0 nA","voltage 2.5 V","temperature 125.0 degC","size 1.0 nm"]}],"abstract":"In this paper we demonstrate a unipolar selector based on Cu-based active layer.

We have developed a two-terminal bi-directional threshold switching selector and integrated the selector with a perpendicular MTJ to form a 1S1R device. The write operations between \"AP\" and \"P\" resistance state have been demonstrated for 1S1R STT-MRAM devices. A simulation model has been developed to simulate conductive filament growth and dissolution process, and dynamic switching of coupled pMTJ and selector devices. The simulation results show the importance of optimal matching of pMTJ magnetic properties with selector resistive properties to achieve high performance.","doi":"10.1109/IMW.2018.8388833","publicationTitle":"2018 IEEE International Memory Workshop (IMW)","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 IEEE International Memory Workshop (IMW)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8385224/8388765/08388833.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IMW.2018.8388833","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8388765","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High Density 3D Cross-Point STT-MRAM","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"High Density 3D Cross-Point STT-MRAM","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"21 June 2018","accessionNumber":"17861120","publicationDate":"May 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8388833/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8388833/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 May 2018","conferenceDate":"13-16 May 2018","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High Density 3D Cross-Point STT-MRAM","confLoc":"Kyoto, Japan","sourcePdf":"pid1212510.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047671S","chronDate":"13-16 May 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8385224","isNumber":"8388765","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8385224","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"8388765","articleId":"8388833","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8388836,"authors":[{"name":"Manan Suri","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi"],"firstName":"Manan","lastName":"Suri","id":"37902980300"},{"name":"Supriya Chakraborty","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi"],"firstName":"Supriya","lastName":"Chakraborty","id":"37086402553"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-5247-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-5248-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2573-7503"}],"articleNumber":"8388836","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":389},"abstract":"Emerging Non-Volatile Memory (NVM) based Physically Unclonable Function (PUF) can be used for hardware security applications such as: intellectual property (IP) protection, encryption key generation, IoT device security, cryptography etc. In this paper, we demonstrate for the first time extraction of highquality PUF signatures from commercial RRAM ICs.

The challenge to achieve a high temperature data retention without compromising the device programming speed can be addressed by material engineering. We show that volume and thermal confinement improvement of the phase-change material enables a high (10-fold) reduction of the programming current, achieved also by the optimization of the device architecture, in particular in the case of a confined structure. It leads to a higher cell efficiency proven by a 6\u00d7 reduction of the programming current density wrt a standard PCM structure. Furthermore, we demonstrate the reduction of thermal losses by the tuning of the thermal conductivity of the dielectrics surrounding the phase-change material. Finally, we propose some considerations about the PCM ultimate scaling and the reliability at such dimensions, showing that the engineering of the bottom electrode/phase-change material interface can lead to a reduced variability in scaled devices.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8388845/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 May 2018","publicationDate":"May 2018","conferenceDate":"13-16 May 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8388845/","dateOfInsertion":"21 June 2018","accessionNumber":"17861149","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Phase-Change Memory: Performance, Roles and Challenges","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Phase-Change Memory: Performance, Roles and Challenges","confLoc":"Kyoto, Japan","sourcePdf":"pid1212380.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.093344S","chronDate":"13-16 May 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8385224","isNumber":"8388765","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8385224","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"8388765","articleId":"8388845","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-09"},{"_id":8388846,"authors":[{"name":"Satoru Ito","affiliation":["Panasonic Semiconductor Solutions Co., Ltd., Kyoto, Japan"],"firstName":"Satoru","lastName":"Ito","id":"38466823400"},{"name":"Yukio Hayakawa","affiliation":["Panasonic Semiconductor Solutions Co., Ltd., Kyoto, Japan"],"firstName":"Yukio","lastName":"Hayakawa","id":"38238491000"},{"name":"Zhiqiang Wei","affiliation":["Panasonic Semiconductor Solutions Co., Ltd., Kyoto, Japan"],"firstName":"Zhiqiang","lastName":"Wei","id":"37086022390"},{"name":"Shunsaku Muraoka","affiliation":["Panasonic Semiconductor Solutions Co., Ltd., Kyoto, Japan"],"firstName":"Shunsaku","lastName":"Muraoka","id":"37323288200"},{"name":"Koichi Kawashima","affiliation":["Panasonic Semiconductor Solutions Co., Ltd., Kyoto, Japan"],"firstName":"Koichi","lastName":"Kawashima","id":"37088723750"},{"name":"Hideto Kotani","affiliation":["Panasonic Semiconductor Solutions Co., Ltd., Kyoto, Japan"],"firstName":"Hideto","lastName":"Kotani","id":"37088728096"},{"name":"Kazuyuki Kouno","affiliation":["Panasonic Semiconductor Solutions Co., Ltd., Kyoto, Japan"],"firstName":"Kazuyuki","lastName":"Kouno","id":"37085829562"},{"name":"Masayoshi Nakamura","firstName":"Masayoshi","lastName":"Nakamura","id":"37088729095"},{"name":"Guo An Du","affiliation":["United Microelectronics Corporation, Singapore"],"firstName":"Guo An","lastName":"Du","id":"37088726916"},{"name":"Jiann Fu Chen","affiliation":["United Microelectronics Corporation, Singapore"],"firstName":"Jiann Fu","lastName":"Chen","id":"37088730291"},{"name":"Stanley PL Yeoh","affiliation":["United Microelectronics Corporation, Singapore"],"firstName":"Stanley PL","lastName":"Yeoh","id":"37088743404"},{"name":"Mars HY Chen","firstName":"Mars HY","lastName":"Chen","id":"37088739101"},{"name":"Takumi Mikawa","affiliation":["Panasonic Semiconductor Solutions Co., Ltd., Kyoto, Japan"],"firstName":"Takumi","lastName":"Mikawa","id":"37607329000"},{"name":"Shinichi Yoneda","affiliation":["Panasonic Semiconductor Solutions Co., Ltd., Kyoto, Japan"],"firstName":"Shinichi","lastName":"Yoneda","id":"38235888000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-5247-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-5248-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2573-7503"}],"articleNumber":"8388846","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1011},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sensors","Metals","Electrodes","Reliability","Switches","Hydrogen","Etching"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS memory circuits","embedded systems","integrated circuit reliability","low-power electronics","resistive RAM"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ReRAM technology","embedded memory","low-power embedded applications","resistive switching element process technologies","filament characterization methods","low-power neural network processors","ReRAM array characteristics","temperature 85.0 degC","size 40.0 nm"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8388846","abstract":"We have developed 40nm ReRAM for low-power embedded applications.

DRAM technology is breaking the 20nm wall and it is near to produce 4F2 cell. This evolutionary thrust widens the space in the memory hierarchy thus allowing access to Emerging Memory (EM) technologies with performances in between NAND and DRAM. Actual access, however, depends on the level of reliability achieved by the specific EM. In particular, consistency of writing and reading mechanisms is a necessary condition for large scale production. In general, the voltage distribution of logical ones and logical zeros move with time, temperature, number of cycles, and possibly, other parameters, sometimes unknown. We propose an architectural solution applicable to a wide class of memory technologies to structurally provide a solid and reliable reading mechanism. During the reading itself, we produce, directly from the pattern stored in the cells, an adaptive reading reference able to follow these changes. Ensuring, by a proper encoding, a limited weight range for the admissible patterns, and moving the problem in the time domain, we first produce a time event to estimate the position of the lower distribution, and next, by adding an appropriate delay, a reference event to distinguish ones from zeros. Statistical simulations confirm the effectiveness of the methodology.","doi":"10.1109/IMW.2018.8388849","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IMW.2018.8388849","publicationTitle":"2018 IEEE International Memory Workshop (IMW)","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 IEEE International Memory Workshop (IMW)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8385224/8388765/08388849.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8388765","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8388849/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 May 2018","displayDocTitle":"Self-Referenced Read Methodology for EMs","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"13-16 May 2018","accessionNumber":"17861150","htmlLink":"/document/8388849/","dateOfInsertion":"21 June 2018","publicationDate":"May 2018","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Self-Referenced Read Methodology for EMs","confLoc":"Kyoto, Japan","sourcePdf":"pid1212204.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.074804S","chronDate":"13-16 May 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8385224","isNumber":"8388765","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8385224","xplore-issue":"8388765","articleId":"8388849","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8388850,"authors":[{"name":"Yung Chun Lee","affiliation":["Macronix International Co., Ltd, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Yung Chun","lastName":"Lee","id":"38185585300"},{"name":"Wei-Chen Chen","affiliation":["Macronix Int.

However, direct experimental evidence for its switching and failure mechanism is still missing. In this work, we proposed the resistive switching and failure model of TaOX/HfO2 bilayer device in 3D vertical RRAM by RTN-based defect tracking technique. After extracting the locations and energy levels (XT, ET) of defects in both HRS and LRS, Defect-less Region in TaOX layer was directly observed which corresponded to the resistive switching. Furthermore, by monitoring the Defect-less Region in different cycling number and retention time, the main reason of the ON/OFF ratio degradation was revealed. This provides a useful tool for improving the non-filament RRAM technology.","doi":"10.1109/IMW.2018.8388852","publicationTitle":"2018 IEEE International Memory Workshop (IMW)","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 IEEE International Memory Workshop (IMW)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8385224/8388765/08388852.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IMW.2018.8388852","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8388765","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Switching and Failure Mechanism of Self-Selective Cell in 3D VRRAM by RTN-Based Defect Tracking Technique","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"13-16 May 2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8388852/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 May 2018","displayDocTitle":"Switching and Failure Mechanism of Self-Selective Cell in 3D VRRAM by RTN-Based Defect Tracking Technique","dateOfInsertion":"21 June 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8388852/","accessionNumber":"17861148","publicationDate":"May 2018","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Switching and Failure Mechanism of Self-Selective Cell in 3D VRRAM by RTN-Based Defect Tracking Technique","confLoc":"Kyoto, Japan","sourcePdf":"pid1211616.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.075838S","chronDate":"13-16 May 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8385224","isNumber":"8388765","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8385224","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"8388765","articleId":"8388852","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8388853,"authors":[{"name":"Hung-Sheng Chang","affiliation":["Macronix International Co., Ltd., Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Hung-Sheng","lastName":"Chang","id":"37085672906"},{"name":"Hang-Ting Lue","affiliation":["Macronix International Co., Ltd., Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Hang-Ting","lastName":"Lue","id":"37275349600"},{"name":"Yuan-Hao Chang","affiliation":["Institute of Information Science, Academia Sinica, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Yuan-Hao","lastName":"Chang","id":"37537830500"},{"name":"Hsiang-Pang Li","affiliation":["Macronix International Co., Ltd., Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Hsiang-Pang","lastName":"Li","id":"37072955000"},{"name":"Keh-Chung Wang","affiliation":["Macronix International Co., Ltd., Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Keh-Chung","lastName":"Wang","id":"37086057384"},{"name":"Chih-Yuan Lu","affiliation":["Macronix International Co., Ltd., Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chih-Yuan","lastName":"Lu","id":"37085463898"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-5247-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-5248-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2573-7503"}],"articleNumber":"8388853","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":453},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Three-dimensional displays","Flash memories","Programming","Junctions","Performance evaluation","Layout","System performance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["flash memories","NAND circuits","storage management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["block size","bit-alterable 3D NAND device","dual-channel floating-body 3D NAND devices","system performance analysis","high-performance solid-state drive applications","erase operation","FN erasing","FN programming","garbage collection","effective programming time","write amplification effect","bit-alterable 3D NAND Flash"]}],"abstract":"NAND Flash is not bit-alterable in the erase operation, and the erase is often carried out in a very large block size. This deteriorates the overall system performances. In this work, we propose a novel bit-alterable 3D NAND Flash that can overcome the drawback of large block size for erase. Such bit-alterable 3D NAND device is possible by adopting novel dual-channel floating-body 3D NAND devices, where both +FN programming and -FN erasing are selectable with suitable inhibit methods. Because erase can be carried out in a much smaller page unit rather than a large block, our evaluation indicates significant improvements in garbage collection (GC) and effective programming time.

We examine a channel state information (CSI) acquisition strategy that exploits both the spatial and temporal correlations among the channels of adjacent base station antennas. The proposed strategy solely collects CSI for a subset of antennas and time frames. Then full CSI is approximated using the CSI of adjacent antennas and previous frames. This critically reduces the CSI acquisition complexity while sacrificing the CSI quality and, hence, introduces a scalable performance-complexity tradeoff. The numerical results demonstrate that, for practical mobile speeds, the proposed scheme reduces the computational complexity and enhances the energy efficiency of massive MIMO base stations against systems with complete CSI, while approximately preserving performance.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/25/8466982/08388873.pdf","startPage":"9016","endPage":"9020","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2018.2849263","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2018.2849263","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8466982","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8388873","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Partial CSI Acquisition for Size-Constrained Massive MIMO Systems With User Mobility","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Channel estimation","Correlation","MIMO communication","Downlink","Manganese","Antenna arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","communication complexity","correlation methods","MIMO communication","mobile radio","telecommunication network reliability","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["user mobility","physically constrained massive multiple-input multiple-output systems","channel state information acquisition strategy","adjacent base station antennas","scalable performance-complexity tradeoff","computational complexity","spatial channel correlations","temporal channel correlations","size-constrained massive MIMO base station systems","partial CSI acquisition complexity"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Massive MIMO","partial CSI","temporal and spatial correlations","energy efficiency"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8388873/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2018","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 June 2018","displayDocTitle":"Partial CSI Acquisition for Size-Constrained Massive MIMO Systems With User Mobility","volume":"67","issue":"9","htmlLink":"/document/8388873/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2018","accessionNumber":"18095091","dateOfInsertion":"06 May 2019","isOpenAccess":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000266","fundingName":"Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council","grantNumber":"EP/M014150/1"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Partial CSI Acquisition for Size-Constrained Massive MIMO Systems With User Mobility","sourcePdf":"tvt-qian-2849263-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.078638S","chronDate":"Sept.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"8466982","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"8466982","articleId":"8388873","onlineDate":"20 June 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8388874,"authors":[{"name":"Tian Wang","affiliation":["Institute of Microelectronics, Peking University, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/92/8472222/8388874/wang-2842067-small.gif","p":["Tian Wang received the B.Sc. degree in microelectronics from Peking University, Beijing, China, in 2013.

DATS makes use of the intrinsic advantage of the IG-mode FinFET to adjust the threshold of the front gate with the back-gate bias adaptively according to the operating frequency. Consequently, the power consumption, especially leakage power of the circuit, would be reduced effectively without circuit performance deterioration. By further comparing the circuits where the DATS scheme is employed with the circuits that do not adopt the scheme, the power optimization levels with different path delays in different operating frequency ranges are discussed in detail. A design instance of DATS based on digitally controlled phase-locked loop is implemented with an ASAP 7-nm FinFET model. Simulation results illustrate that by employing DATS the power reduction could be up to 30% in the best case.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8388874/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 June 2018","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2018","volume":"26","issue":"10","accessionNumber":"18129640","dateOfInsertion":"26 September 2018","publicationDate":"Oct. 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8388874/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Evaluation of Dynamic-Adjusting Threshold-Voltage Scheme for Low-Power FinFET Circuits","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004826","fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of Beijing Municipality","grantNumber":"4152020"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61306040"},{"fundingName":"State Key Development Program for Basic Research of China (973)","grantNumber":"2015CB057201"},{"fundingName":"Shenzhen Science and Technology Innovation Committee","grantNumber":"20170412150411676"},{"fundingName":"Guangdong Science and Technology Project","grantNumber":"2014B090913001"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Evaluation of Dynamic-Adjusting Threshold-Voltage Scheme for Low-Power FinFET Circuits","sourcePdf":"tvlsi-wang-2842067-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.075562S","chronDate":"Oct.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"92","isNumber":"8472222","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","xplore-issue":"8472222","articleId":"8388874","onlineDate":"20 June 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8388875,"authors":[{"name":"Xian Li","affiliation":["Washington State University, Pullman, WA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/92/8472222/8388875/li-2843282-small.gif","p":["Xian Li (S\u201915) received the Ph.D. degree from the School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Washington State University, Pullman, WA, USA.","His current research interests include hardware accelerator for biocomputing and cyber-physical systems."]},"firstName":"Xian","lastName":"Li","id":"37085417593"},{"name":"Karthi Duraisamy","affiliation":["Washington State University, Pullman, WA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/92/8472222/8388875/durai-2843282-small.gif","p":["Karthi Duraisamy (S\u201914) received the Ph.D. degree in computer engineering from Washington State University, Pullman, WA, USA.","His current research interests include network-on-chips, low-power system-on-chips, and passive optical networks."]},"firstName":"Karthi","lastName":"Duraisamy","orcid":"0000-0003-3848-6344","id":"37085353151"},{"name":"Paul Bogdan","affiliation":["University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/92/8472222/8388875/bogda-2843282-small.gif","p":["Paul Bogdan (M\u201912) is currently an Assistant Professor at the Ming Hsieh Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, USA.

Communication between the brain and external hardware using neural stimulation and recordings has also been demonstrated recently. Such systems are usually analyzed by employing the brain-machine-body interface (BMBI) model. However, owing to the high complexity of the human brain activity, modeling and analyzing the neural-signals is a resource-intensive task. Moreover, coupling neural signals from different physical entities inevitably leads to large input data sets and hence, also making it data- and computationally intensive. Hence, here we employ a spatiotemporal fractal parallel algorithm to efficiently generate and analyze the BMBI models. However, such an algorithm can lead to demanding on-chip traffic patterns requiring an efficient communication infrastructure among different computing cores. To address this issue, we propose a machine-learning-inspired wireless network-on-chip (WiNoC)-based manycore architecture for handling the compute- and communication-intensive nature of the BMBI applications. The experimental results show that, compared with the traditional wireline mesh NoC, WiNoC achieves up to 55% savings in energy delay product for a system size of 1024 cores.","doi":"10.1109/TVLSI.2018.2843282","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVLSI.2018.2843282","startPage":"1895","endPage":"1907","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/92/8472222/08388875.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8472222","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Scalable Network-on-Chip Architectures for Brain\u2013Machine Interface Applications","chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/92/8472222/8388875-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8388875/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2018","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 June 2018","displayDocTitle":"Scalable Network-on-Chip Architectures for Brain\u2013Machine Interface Applications","volume":"26","issue":"10","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"26 September 2018","accessionNumber":"18114913","publicationDate":"Oct. 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8388875/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"CNS-1564014 and CCF 1514269"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000183","fundingName":"Army Research Office","grantNumber":"W911NF-17-1-0485"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000185","fundingName":"Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency","grantNumber":"W911NF-17-1-0076"},{"fundingName":"DARPA Young Faculty Award","grantNumber":"N66001-17-1-4044"},{"fundingName":"National Science Foundation CAREER Award","grantNumber":"CPS-1453860"},{"fundingName":"Okawa foundation support"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","chorusFlag":"true","title":"Scalable Network-on-Chip Architectures for Brain\u2013Machine Interface Applications","sourcePdf":"tvlsi-pande-2843282-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.17195S","chronDate":"Oct.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"92","isNumber":"8472222","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"8472222","articleId":"8388875","onlineDate":"20 June 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8388892,"authors":[{"name":"Haocheng Cai","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Information Engineering, Tianjin University, Tianjin, China"],"firstName":"Haocheng","lastName":"Cai","id":"37086399152"},{"name":"Luhong Mao","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Information Engineering, Tianjin University, Tianjin, China"],"firstName":"Luhong","lastName":"Mao","id":"37325187600"},{"name":"Jia Cong","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Information Engineering, Tianjin University, Tianjin, China"],"firstName":"Jia","lastName":"Cong","id":"37086400046"},{"name":"Yifei Zhang","affiliation":["Faculty of Vehicle Engineering and Mechanics, Dalian University of Technology, Dalian, China"],"firstName":"Yifei","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37086398798"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-3628-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"DVD ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-3626-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-3629-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8388892","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":323},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8388892","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Dual band","Power amplifiers","Harmonic analysis","Impedance","Power generation","Impedance matching","Transistors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["microwave power amplifiers","transmission lines","UHF power amplifiers","wideband amplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dual band Class-J power amplifiers","large-signal transistor model","Class-J impedance","two-section transmission line","dual band Class-J PA","device output parasitic elements","power added efficiency","PAE","frequency 0.6 GHz to 1.0 GHz","frequency 2.6 GHz to 3.0 GHz"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["component","GaN","dual-band","class-J","high efficiency"]}],"abstract":"Structure in the design of a dual band Class-J power amplifiers (PA) for obtaining high efficiency is presented in this work.

However, there are no recognition criteria to specify the pilot patterns in channel estimation. In order to improve the accuracy of the estimation, this paper proposes a pilot routing algorithm based on minimizing the adjusted mutual coherence of the measurement matrix in the recovery algorithm of compressed sensing theory. Each pilot symbol location is determined by calculating the adjusted mutual coherence of the corresponding measurement matrix. The matrix is produced by fixing other pilot location indexes and replacing the index of the current pilot location with all optional indexes. The simulation results show that the BER is 2dB and 8dB lower when SNR is 5dB and 30dB respectively, and the MSE is 2dB lower compared with the results of algorithm 1. Comparing with the results of algorithm 2, the BER is 2dB better, and the MSE is 3dB lower when SNR is 30dB.

However, traditional works require more than Nyquist sampling rate for HOCs extraction. In this work, a HOCs-based method based on compressive sensing (CS-HOC) is introduced. Without reconstructing the original signal, we propose a scheme to estimate the fourth-order and sixth-order cumulants of unknown signals based on received compressive samples, which greatly reduces the number of samples. In order to deduce the sparse representation of fourth-order and sixth-order statistic, the Walsh-Hadamard Transform is brought in. From the simulations we can see that the CS-HOC method distinctly promotes the classification rate compared with traditional sampling schemes.","doi":"10.1109/ICAIT.2017.8388900","publicationTitle":"2017 9th International Conference on Advanced Infocomm Technology (ICAIT)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 9th International Conference on Advanced Infocomm Technology (ICAIT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8379735/8388809/08388900.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICAIT.2017.8388900","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8388809","startPage":"120","endPage":"126","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Automatic modulation classification using compressive sensing based on High-Order Cumulants","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8388900","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Automatic modulation classification using compressive sensing based on High-Order Cumulants","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 Nov. 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8388900/","conferenceDate":"22-24 Nov. 2017","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2017","accessionNumber":"17858891","dateOfInsertion":"21 June 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8388900/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Automatic modulation classification using compressive sensing based on High-Order Cumulants","confLoc":"Chengdu, China","sourcePdf":"30T043ICAIT.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.087315S","chronDate":"22-24 Nov. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8379735","isNumber":"8388809","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8379735","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8388809","articleId":"8388900","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8388904,"authors":[{"name":"Bingfeng Liu","affiliation":["Luoyang Electronic Equipment Test Center, Luoyang, China"],"firstName":"Bingfeng","lastName":"Liu","id":"37085633320"},{"name":"Yanfei Wei","affiliation":["Luoyang Electronic Equipment Test Center, Luoyang, China"],"firstName":"Yanfei","lastName":"Wei","id":"37085610300"},{"name":"Li Liu","affiliation":["Luoyang Electronic Equipment Test Center, Luoyang, China"],"firstName":"Li","lastName":"Liu","id":"37086399398"},{"name":"Ran Hu","affiliation":["Luoyang Electronic Equipment Test Center, Luoyang, China"],"firstName":"Ran","lastName":"Hu","id":"37086400316"},{"name":"Guanyu Qiao","affiliation":["Luoyang Electronic Equipment Test Center, Luoyang, China"],"firstName":"Guanyu","lastName":"Qiao","id":"37086400282"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-3628-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"DVD ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-3626-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-3629-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8388904","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":106},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Uplink","Downlink","Resource management","Wireless networks","Optimization","Quality of service","Artificial neural networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["frequency division multiple access","OFDM modulation","optimisation","radio links","resource allocation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["joint uplink/downlink resource allocation algorithm","orthogonal frequency division multiple access wireless networks","OFDMA wireless networks"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["joint uplink/downlink","OFDMA wireless networks","resource allocation","interactive service"]}],"abstract":"As the uplink resource and the downlink resource are separated to some extent, conventional resource allocation algorithms usually treat the total system resource allocation independently in wireless networks.

In this paper, we propose a new joint uplink/downlink resource allocation algorithm in orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) wireless networks with interactive service. The uplink and downlink resource are allocated jointly to improve the system performance, and the issue is formulated as an optimization problem.

We consider the case that two independent information sources both desire to send two types of delay-sensitive message to a common destination. One type is generated periodically, and is expected to be delivered with sufficient transmission reliability. The other type is generated randomly, and is expected to have finite transmission delay. Utilizing the Lyapunov optimization theory, we design a transmission strategy to achieve high energy efficiency based on both imperfect channel state information (CSI) at the physical layer and queue state information (QSI) at the Media Access Control layer. Simulation results show that the performance of the proposed strategy can be balanced through tuning optimization parameters. The capability of being adaptive to both CSI and QSI also permits the proposed method to outperform the transmission design based on only CSI.","pdfPath":"/iel7/8379735/8388809/08388911.pdf","startPage":"182","endPage":"188","publicationTitle":"2017 9th International Conference on Advanced Infocomm Technology (ICAIT)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8388809","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICAIT.2017.8388911","doi":"10.1109/ICAIT.2017.8388911","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 9th International Conference on Advanced Infocomm Technology (ICAIT)","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8388911","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Energy efficiency","Delays","Wireless communication","Optimization","Channel estimation","Reliability","Estimation error"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["delays","Lyapunov methods","quality of service","queueing theory","radio networks","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["energy efficient cross-layer transmission design","two-user wireless systems","imperfect channel state information","multiuser wireless network","delay-sensitive message","finite transmission delay","Lyapunov optimization theory","queue state information","Media Access Control layer"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["energy efficiency","imperfect CSI","lyapunov optimization"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 Nov. 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8388911/","displayDocTitle":"Energy efficient cross-layer transmission design for two-user wireless systems with imperfect channel state information","accessionNumber":"17858921","dateOfInsertion":"21 June 2018","publicationDate":"Nov. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8388911/","conferenceDate":"22-24 Nov. 2017","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy efficient cross-layer transmission design for two-user wireless systems with imperfect channel state information","confLoc":"Chengdu, China","sourcePdf":"41T033ICAIT.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.088353S","chronDate":"22-24 Nov. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8379735","isNumber":"8388809","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8379735","xplore-issue":"8388809","articleId":"8388911","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8388914,"authors":[{"name":"Xin Li","affiliation":["Shanghai Institute of Satellite Engineering, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Xin","lastName":"Li","id":"37085669733"},{"name":"Yuan Chen","affiliation":["Institute of Optical Communication Engineering, Nanjing University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Yuan","lastName":"Chen","id":"37086399756"},{"name":"Jinfang Wang","affiliation":["Shanghai Xin Yue Lian Hui Electronic Technology Co., LTD, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Jinfang","lastName":"Wang","id":"37086399443"},{"name":"Yang Liu","affiliation":["Shanghai Institute of Satellite Engineering, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Yang","lastName":"Liu","id":"37085677570"},{"name":"Xun Sun","affiliation":["Institute of Optical Communication Engineering, Nanjing University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Xun","lastName":"Sun","id":"37086398686"},{"name":"Mi Li","affiliation":["Institute of Optical Communication Engineering, Nanjing University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Mi","lastName":"Li","id":"37085550068"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-3628-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"DVD ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-3626-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-3629-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8388914","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":57},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optical fiber communication","Receivers","Modulation","Apertures","Spectral efficiency","Satellites","Uplink"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["differential phase shift keying","error statistics","free-space optical communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["m-ary differential phase shift","phase modulation technology","MDPSK free space optical communication system","MDPSK system","MDPSK modulation format","point error effect","MDPSK space optical communication system"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["free space optical communication","bit error rate","point error","MDPSK"]}],"abstract":"Bit error rate (BER) performance is an important indicator to measure the quality of a space optical communication system.

M-ary differential phase shift keying (MDPSK) is a new format of phase modulation technologies. In this paper, we discuss a situation that point error is the only mechanical system effect on a MDPSK free space optical communication system. We give the BER expression of a MDPSK system under the effect of point error. Then we numerically analyze several link parameters such as transmission power, transmission aperture, divergence angle and receiver diameter. We concentrate on analyzing how each parameter influences the BER performance of the MDPSK system.

Usually the on-board signal processor is customized for the satellite which it is implemented on, with high processing ability but also with high construction cost and difficulty of reconfiguration. Thus a reconfigurable on-board processor is required to fulfill the demand of more frequent and periodic configuration update. This paper presents a computing task allocation scheme based on general purpose processor, (GPP)-digital signal processor (DSP) signal processing system, in which GPP handles the generic algorithms such as channel coding, modulation, time and frequency synchronization while DSP is in charge of special mathematic operations. We first introduce a low earth orbit (LEO) orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) satellite physical layer system as an example with an analysis of the system's calculation characteristics. After that, a computing task allocation scheme corresponding to the system is derived based on the computation characteristic of all the modules in the system. Finally, the processing time with and without the scheme algorithm is tested on a system consist of a PC and a DSP board. Experiment results show that the processing time of the DSP-GPP system is shortened using the proposed scheme, compared to the GPP-only system without the task allocation scheme.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A GPP-DSP based computing task allocation scheme for on-board signal processing in OFDM satellite system","publicationTitle":"2017 9th International Conference on Advanced Infocomm Technology (ICAIT)","doi":"10.1109/ICAIT.2017.8388932","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 9th International Conference on Advanced Infocomm Technology (ICAIT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8379735/8388809/08388932.pdf","startPage":"290","endPage":"296","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICAIT.2017.8388932","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8388809","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8388932","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8388932/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 Nov. 2017","displayDocTitle":"A GPP-DSP based computing task allocation scheme for on-board signal processing in OFDM satellite system","conferenceDate":"22-24 Nov. 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8388932/","dateOfInsertion":"21 June 2018","publicationDate":"Nov. 2017","accessionNumber":"17858945","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A GPP-DSP based computing task allocation scheme for on-board signal processing in OFDM satellite system","confLoc":"Chengdu, China","sourcePdf":"62T025ICAIT.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056482S","chronDate":"22-24 Nov. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8379735","isNumber":"8388809","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8379735","xplore-issue":"8388809","articleId":"8388932","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8388941,"authors":[{"name":"Jiaqi Lin","affiliation":["School of Information and Electronics, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Jiaqi","lastName":"Lin","id":"37086399285"},{"name":"Yuan Feng","affiliation":["School of Information and Electronics, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yuan","lastName":"Feng","id":"38001269300"},{"name":"Shengheng Liu","affiliation":["IDCom, The University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, United Kingdom"],"firstName":"Shengheng","lastName":"Liu","id":"37085444217"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-3628-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"DVD ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-3626-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-3629-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8388941","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":86},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Imaging","Scattering","Azimuth","Computational complexity","Frequency-domain analysis","Time-domain analysis","Image resolution"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","Fourier transforms","frequency modulation","image resolution","radar imaging","synthetic aperture radar"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["scattering points","imaging resolution","fast ISAR imaging","Range-Doppler algorithm","inverse synthetic aperture radars","high-resolution images","linear frequency modulated signals","long-range detection","fast RD imaging algorithm","sparse Fourier Transform","echo signals"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["uniformly rotating targets","inverse synthetic aperture radar (ISAR)","sparse Fourier transform (SFT)","computational complexity"]}],"abstract":"Range-Doppler (RD) algorithm is conventionally a favorable choice in inverse synthetic aperture radars to generate high-resolution images of the uniformly rotating targets. However, when waveforms with a large time-bandwidth product, such as the linear frequency modulated signals, are adopted to achieve a long-range detection with high resolution, the resulted computational complexity in the imaging process becomes unbearable. Taking into account the fact that the scattering points generally exhibit sparsity in both range and azimuth dimension, we present a fast RD imaging algorithm based on sparse Fourier Transform in this paper. The echo signals from the scattering points are processed in a two-dimensional manner, and a novel coherent integration method is developed to enhance the algorithm robustness in low signal-to-noise ratio scenarios. The overall computational complexity is significantly reduced without compromising the imaging resolution. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is validated by numerical simulation results.","doi":"10.1109/ICAIT.2017.8388941","publicationTitle":"2017 9th International Conference on Advanced Infocomm Technology (ICAIT)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 9th International Conference on Advanced Infocomm Technology (ICAIT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8379735/8388809/08388941.pdf","startPage":"334","endPage":"339","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICAIT.2017.8388941","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8388809","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fast ISAR imaging based on sparse fourier transform algorithm","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8388941","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 Nov. 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8388941/","displayDocTitle":"Fast ISAR imaging based on sparse fourier transform algorithm","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2017","accessionNumber":"17858959","htmlLink":"/document/8388941/","conferenceDate":"22-24 Nov. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"21 June 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fast ISAR imaging based on sparse fourier transform algorithm","confLoc":"Chengdu, China","sourcePdf":"71T051ICAIT.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06411S","chronDate":"22-24 Nov. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8379735","isNumber":"8388809","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8379735","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8388809","articleId":"8388941","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8388942,"authors":[{"name":"Jing Chen","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Jing","lastName":"Chen","id":"37086401043"},{"name":"Yao Shen","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Yao","lastName":"Shen","id":"37086381605"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-3628-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"DVD ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-3626-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-3629-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8388942","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":336},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The effect of kernel size of CNNs for lung nodule classification","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 9th International Conference on Advanced Infocomm Technology (ICAIT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8379735/8388809/08388942.pdf","startPage":"340","endPage":"344","publicationTitle":"2017 9th International Conference on Advanced Infocomm Technology (ICAIT)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICAIT.2017.8388942","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8388809","doi":"10.1109/ICAIT.2017.8388942","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Kernel","Convolution","Lung","Sensitivity","Solid modeling","Feature extraction","Computed tomography"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CAD","cancer","computerised tomography","convolution","feature extraction","feedforward neural nets","image classification","learning (artificial intelligence)","lung","medical image processing","object recognition","patient diagnosis","visual databases"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["kernel size","lung cancer diagnosis","pulmonary nodules","lung nodules classification","CNN architectures","computer aided detection system","CAD","lung nodule detection system","thoracic computed tomography scans","deep learning","object recognition","convolutional neural network","LIDC","convolution layers","lung image database consortium dataset"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["computer-aided detection(CAD)","lung nodule classification","convolutional neural network","convolution kernel size"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8388942","abstract":"Early detection in lung nodule will be helpful for lung cancer diagnosis.

However, the network transmission delay of multiple video streams from certain video sources to the base station via the core network are different, which results in the asynchronous among the video streams when users switch streams. It tremendously degrades user Quality of Experience (QoE). Considering the social characteristics of MVV users in terms of spatially clustering and the similarity of interests on MVV streams, we introduce the edge caching technology in fog computing into the application of MVV in mobile social networks (MSNs), with which the MVV streams can be synchronized with the assistance of edge caching among local users. Besides, we model the spatial distribution of edge caching users to calculate their capability of edge caching and D2D communication, as well as the coverage probability and Ergodic rate of the multicast groups. Moreover, the edge caching user selection is formulated as an optimization problem to maximize the system throughput, and a greedy based edge caching algorithm is proposed to find the suboptimal solution. Simulation results indicate that the proposed edge caching scheme can significantly increase the QoE of MVV and the system throughput.","doi":"10.1109/ICAIT.2017.8388946","publicationTitle":"2017 9th International Conference on Advanced Infocomm Technology (ICAIT)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 9th International Conference on Advanced Infocomm Technology (ICAIT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8379735/8388809/08388946.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICAIT.2017.8388946","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8388809","startPage":"361","endPage":"366","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fog computing aided multi-view video in mobile social networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8388946","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Fog computing aided multi-view video in mobile social networks","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 Nov. 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8388946/","conferenceDate":"22-24 Nov. 2017","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2017","accessionNumber":"17858890","dateOfInsertion":"21 June 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8388946/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fog computing aided multi-view video in mobile social networks","confLoc":"Chengdu, China","sourcePdf":"76T3018ICAIT.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.077791S","chronDate":"22-24 Nov. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8379735","isNumber":"8388809","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8379735","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8388809","articleId":"8388946","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8388953,"authors":[{"name":"Weiguo Yang","affiliation":["Shandong Normal University, Jinan, China"],"firstName":"Weiguo","lastName":"Yang","id":"37086399196"},{"name":"Chunxing Wang","affiliation":["Shandong Normal University, Jinan, China"],"firstName":"Chunxing","lastName":"Wang","id":"37086400122"},{"name":"Bing Xue","affiliation":["Shandong Normal University, Jinan, China"],"firstName":"Bing","lastName":"Xue","id":"37086399082"},{"name":"Jianping Qiao","affiliation":["Shandong Normal University, Jinan, China"],"firstName":"Jianping","lastName":"Qiao","id":"37288458500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-3628-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"DVD ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-3626-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-3629-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8388953","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":91},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image reconstruction","Dictionaries","Image resolution","Feature extraction","Signal resolution","Interpolation","Training"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer vision","image representation","image resolution","image restoration","singular value decomposition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["high-resolution image quality","sparse representation coefficients","LR dictionary","HR training image feature blocks","computer vision systems","image super-resolution reconstruction method","sparse dictionary learning","nonlocal self-similarity regularization","K-SVD algorithm","edge detail restoration"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["image super-resolution","adaptive regularization","non-local similarity","sparse representation"]}],"abstract":"Image super-resolution reconstruction plays an important role in computer vision systems.

Firstly, we assume that HR and low-resolution (LR) image blocks have the same sparse representation coefficients. The LR dictionary and sparse representation coefficients are obtained by using the K-SVD algorithm. Then an intermediate HR result is reconstructed by utilizing the HR training image feature blocks.

In this technique, by exploiting the concept of NOMA, unlike the conventional method of cooperative relaying, the second time slot is also utilized for the realization of information sent from the transmitter end. Moreover, as the data symbols are transmitted by nodes with full power, the compulsion of complex power allocation coefficients is precluded. In conventional cooperative relaying systems, the receiver is only able to receive a single bit of information, while the receiver can reliably bring in two data symbols in two-time slots. In this regard, this scheme is able to acquire higher achievable rate performance than existing cooperative relaying schemes for larger channel powers over most of the transmit SNR regime. Furthermore, a mathematical expression is also derived for the total achievable rate of CRS-NOMA. The results are verified through Monte-Carlo simulations which validate accuracy and consistency of the derived analytical results.","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 4th International Conference on Recent Advances in Information Technology (RAIT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8376941/8388962/08388972.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","publicationTitle":"2018 4th International Conference on Recent Advances in Information Technology (RAIT)","doi":"10.1109/RAIT.2018.8388972","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RAIT.2018.8388972","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8388962","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8388972","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Achievable rate analysis of relay assisted cooperative NOMA over Rician fading channels","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["NOMA","Relays","Rician channels","Resource management","Signal to noise ratio","5G mobile communication","Information technology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["amplify and forward communication","cooperative communication","fading channels","MIMO communication","multi-access systems","Rayleigh channels","relay networks (telecommunication)","Rician channels","statistical analysis","telecommunication network reliability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Rician fading channels","nonorthogonal multiple access","performance gain","complex power allocation coefficients","total achievable rate","achievable rate analysis","relay assisted cooperative NOMA","cooperative fixed decode-and-forward relay system"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access","Cooperative Relaying System","Superposition Coding","Rician Fading Channels","Achievable Rate","Decode and Forward Relay"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8388972/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-17 March 2018","displayDocTitle":"Achievable rate analysis of relay assisted cooperative NOMA over Rician fading channels","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8388972/","publicationDate":"March 2018","accessionNumber":"17858749","dateOfInsertion":"21 June 2018","conferenceDate":"15-17 March 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Achievable rate analysis of relay assisted cooperative NOMA over Rician fading channels","confLoc":"Dhanbad, India","sourcePdf":"105PAPER96.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.09283S","chronDate":"15-17 March 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8376941","isNumber":"8388962","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8376941","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"8388962","articleId":"8388972","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8388973,"authors":[{"name":"Pranav Kumar Jha","affiliation":["Department of ECE, National Institute of Technology, Tiruchirappalli, Tamil Nadu, India"],"firstName":"Pranav Kumar","lastName":"Jha","id":"37086404452"},{"name":"S.

In this paper, the achievable average rate of an Opportunistic Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access (O-NOMA) based Cooperative Relaying System (CRS) is studied under Rician fading channels with Channel State Information (CSI) available at the source terminal. Based on CSI, for opportunistic transmission, the source immediately chooses either the direct transmission or the cooperative NOMA transmission using the relay, which can provide better achievable average rate performance than the existing Conventional-NOMA (C-NOMA) based CRS with no CSI at the source node. Furthermore, a mathematical expression is also derived for the achievable average rate and the results are compared with C-NOMA based CRS with no CSI at the transmitter end, over a range of increasing power allocation coefficients, transmit Signal-to-Noise Ratios (SNRs) and average channel powers. Numerical results show that the CRS using O-NOMA with CSI achieves better spectral efficiency in terms of the achievable average rate than the Conventional-NOMA based CRS without CSI. To check the consistency of the derived analytical results, Monte Carlo simulations are performed which verify that the results are consistent and matched well with the simulation results.","doi":"10.1109/RAIT.2018.8388973","publicationTitle":"2018 4th International Conference on Recent Advances in Information Technology (RAIT)","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 4th International Conference on Recent Advances in Information Technology (RAIT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8376941/8388962/08388973.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RAIT.2018.8388973","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8388962","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An opportunistic-non orthogonal multiple access based cooperative relaying system over Rician fading channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8388973","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"An opportunistic-non orthogonal multiple access based cooperative relaying system over Rician fading channels","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-17 March 2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8388973/","conferenceDate":"15-17 March 2018","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"March 2018","accessionNumber":"17858777","dateOfInsertion":"21 June 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8388973/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An opportunistic-non orthogonal multiple access based cooperative relaying system over Rician fading channels","confLoc":"Dhanbad, India","sourcePdf":"106PAPER97.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.076034S","chronDate":"15-17 March 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8376941","isNumber":"8388962","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8376941","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"8388962","articleId":"8388973","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8388977,"authors":[{"name":"Prabhjot Kaur","affiliation":["M.

Other classification algorithm needs to extract the feature of an image using feature extraction algorithm like Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix. Convolutional neural network is a class of deep, feed-forward artificial neural networks that have successfully been applied to recognizing image. It is also widely used in video recognition, image classification, recommender systems, natural language processing and speech recognition. In this paper, a dataset of 7909 breast cancer histopathology images acquired on 82 patients are taken. These images are of two different classes benign and malignant. We extract the patches of the image to train the network and finally we give the image as an input to classify the image.

Multi-focus image fusion techniques can be adopted to solve the above issue because this technique precisely selects every focused point from all parent images to create final fused image. So, the final fused image contains significantly more information regarding every salient objects. In this paper, we have proposed a novel image fusion technique for fusion of multi-focused images using non-sub sampled contourlet transform. Here, we have adopted contourlet transform due to its high edge discrimination property which enables us to capture all salient object edges from different parent images. In this approach first we have generated noise free gray scale parent images using non-linear anisotropic diffusion technique. Further, in all noise free images we have employed contourlet transform to discover all salient object edges. Later, we have used 4 neighborhood entropy calculation technique based winner-take-all approach to generate final fused image. We have also used different multi-focused image sets for experimental analysis. The outcomes of all the image fusion experiments show better performance as compared to the current-sate-of-arts.","doi":"10.1109/RAIT.2018.8389036","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RAIT.2018.8389036","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 4th International Conference on Recent Advances in Information Technology (RAIT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8376941/8388962/08389036.pdf","publicationTitle":"2018 4th International Conference on Recent Advances in Information Technology (RAIT)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8388962","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multi-scale image fusion scheme based on non-sub sampled contourlet transform and four neighborhood Shannon entropy scheme","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"15-17 March 2018","displayDocTitle":"Multi-scale image fusion scheme based on non-sub sampled contourlet transform and four neighborhood Shannon entropy scheme","conferenceDate":"15-17 March 2018","publicationDate":"March 2018","dateOfInsertion":"21 June 2018","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8389036/","accessionNumber":"17858716","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8389036/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multi-scale image fusion scheme based on non-sub sampled contourlet transform and four neighborhood Shannon entropy scheme","confLoc":"Dhanbad, India","sourcePdf":"46PAPER279.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.077789S","chronDate":"15-17 March 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8376941","isNumber":"8388962","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8376941","xplore-issue":"8388962","articleId":"8389036","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":8389045,"authors":[{"name":"Nirmal Kumar Gupta","affiliation":["Department of CSE, Jaypee University, Anoopshahr, India"],"firstName":"Nirmal Kumar","lastName":"Gupta","id":"37086403680"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-3039-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-3038-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-3040-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8389045","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":252},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cloud computing","Software testing","Software as a service","Computational modeling","Task analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","program testing","storage management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computing resources","data storage","application services","cloud applications","cloud computing environment","cloud computing software testing research"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Software Testing","Cloud Computing","Cloud Testing","TaaS","SaaS","PaaS"]}],"abstract":"Cloud computing has changed the way to use computing resources which include computers, network, data storage and application services.

In the propose approach, a potential solution of a TSP is represented by an order of nodes in which a salesman visits all the nodes and named as path. Interchange of the positions of any two nodes of any path is named as swap operation (SO). A set of SOs applied on a path in a particular order is defined as swap sequence(SS). Using this structure of representation of a probable solution, different perturbed rules of PSO are modified using SO and SS to find out the solutions of TSPs in crisp and fuzzy environments. During search process, to improve any static path a strong perturbation technique (K-Opt) is applied. Five different rules are proposed to determine update velocities of a solution in the algorithm. Following roulette wheel selection process, one rule from the rule set is randomly selected each time and is used for updating a solution in the algorithm. K-opt operation is again used at the end of the algorithm for the possible improvement of the best path found so far. The algorithm is capable of solving any TSP with crisp or fuzzy cost matrix. Different sizes benchmark test problems available in TSPLIB are used to test the capability of the algorithm. It is found that success rate of the algorithm is nearly 100% for TSPs with considerably large sizes crisp cost matrix. Due to the absence of test problems on TSP with fuzzy cost matrix in the literature, here, few such problems are randomly generated from some crisp test problems of TSPLIB and are applied to test the capability of the algorithm for solving such problems. It is found form numerical experiments that, efficiency of the said algorithm for solving such problems (Symmetric TSP and Asymmetric TSP) in respect of accuracy and run time is better than some other well established algorithms for TSPs.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-17 March 2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8389060/","accessionNumber":"17858695","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8389060/","publicationDate":"March 2018","dateOfInsertion":"21 June 2018","conferenceDate":"15-17 March 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A modified particle swarm optimization algorithm for solving traveling salesman problem with imprecise cost matrix","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A modified particle swarm optimization algorithm for solving traveling salesman problem with imprecise cost matrix","confLoc":"Dhanbad, India","sourcePdf":"68PAPER6.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.122285S","chronDate":"15-17 March 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8376941","isNumber":"8388962","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8376941","xplore-issue":"8388962","articleId":"8389060","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8389067,"authors":[{"name":"Omprakash W.

The particle swarm optimization is used to search the optimal endmember combination in the feasible solution space, where the movement of each particle has been influenced by its local and global best positions. The proposed method has advantages such as high efficiency, rapid convergence, and a strong capability of global search. In addition, the proposed approach is also equipped with an advantage of the simplex geometry by initializing one of the initial random population using minimum volume simplex analysis algorithm (MVSA). The adaptive strategy not only improves the result in terms of overall accuracy but also maintains the physical constraints on the values of the resultant endmember set. The proposed method has been evaluated using the simulated and real hyperspectral scenes. The experimental results on the hyperspectral scenes, having a high number of endmembers, shows that EEA-PSO obtains a higher extraction precision than the traditional and existing evolutionary endmember extraction algorithms.","doi":"10.1109/RAIT.2018.8389067","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","publicationTitle":"2018 4th International Conference on Recent Advances in Information Technology (RAIT)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RAIT.2018.8389067","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8388962","displayPublicationTitle":"2018 4th International Conference on Recent Advances in Information Technology (RAIT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8376941/8388962/08389067.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"EEA-PSO: Endmember extraction using advance particle swarm optimization","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8389067/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"EEA-PSO: Endmember extraction using advance particle swarm optimization","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8389067/","accessionNumber":"17858779","publicationDate":"March 2018","dateOfInsertion":"21 June 2018","conferenceDate":"15-17 March 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-17 March 2018","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"EEA-PSO: Endmember extraction using advance particle swarm optimization","confLoc":"Dhanbad, India","sourcePdf":"74PAPER104.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.118771S","chronDate":"15-17 March 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8376941","isNumber":"8388962","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8376941","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8388962","articleId":"8389067","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8389068,"authors":[{"name":"Ekaansh Khosla","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology (ISM), Dhanbad, India"],"firstName":"Ekaansh","lastName":"Khosla","id":"37086029782"},{"name":"Dharavath Ramesh","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology (ISM), Dhanbad, India"],"firstName":"Dharavath","lastName":"Ramesh","id":"38546859500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-3039-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-3038-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-3040-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8389068","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":127},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8389068","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Training","Convolution","Acceleration","Cancer","Neural networks","Blood","Machine learning"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cancer","diseases","feedforward neural nets","image classification","learning (artificial intelligence)","medical image processing","natural language processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["phase classification","chronic myeloid leukemia","convolution neural network","disseminate state","human health","commonly identified disease","CML phases","chronic phase","accelerated phase","crisis phase","machine learning field","Artificial Neural Networks","machine learning tasks","Convolutional Neural Network","cancers","ANN architecture"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML)","Treatment","Convolution neural network (CNN)","Classification"]}],"abstract":"In the disseminate state of human health, there are over 100 types of different cancers in which Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is a commonly identified disease. Identification of CML phases such as chronic phase, accelerated phase, and blast crisis phase plays an important role in determining what kind of treatment the patient should receive. In recent times, the machine learning field has taken a spectacular twist with the acclivity of the Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs). These computational models which are biologically inspired are able to give a satisfactory performance in comparison with previous forms of artificial intelligence among various machine learning tasks. From the variants of ANN architecture, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is considered as one of the massive computational paradigm. Currently, CNN is used in various applications like image and video recognition, natural language processing and recommendation systems.

Currently, during in the technology era, the internet is the only real exigent that delivers a glut of services like businesses, banking, communication, education, e-commerce, etc. Distributed Denial of Service attack aims to deny access by legitimate users to shared services or resources. Because of the vulnerability of the initial style of the web, attackers can merely mimic the patterns of legitimate network traffic. The prevailing fingerprint or feature-based methods are not appropriate to detect a recent DDoS attack. In this paper our goal is to detect a DDoS attack as well as Flash Crowd using various information distance measures such as Kullbeck-Leibler, Hellinger and Manhattan distance to measure the flow similarity among the traffic. Further the detection parameters such as Detection Rate, Classification Rate, Precision Rate and False Positive Rate is computed and shows that the Kullbeck-Leibler detection metric effectively detects the attack as compared to the other two.","doi":"10.1109/ICATCCT.2017.8389143","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8389095","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICATCCT.2017.8389143","publicationTitle":"2017 3rd International Conference on Applied and Theoretical Computing and Communication Technology (iCATccT)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 3rd International Conference on Applied and Theoretical Computing and Communication Technology (iCATccT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8376942/8389095/08389143.pdf","startPage":"251","endPage":"258","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An information divergence based approach to detect flooding DDoS attacks and Flash Crowds","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"21-23 Dec. 2017","displayDocTitle":"An information divergence based approach to detect flooding DDoS attacks and Flash Crowds","isConference":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"21-23 Dec. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"21 June 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8389143/","publicationDate":"Dec. 2017","accessionNumber":"17858864","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8389143/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An information divergence based approach to detect flooding DDoS attacks and Flash Crowds","confLoc":"Tumkur, India","sourcePdf":"RP047142.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.079559S","chronDate":"21-23 Dec. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8376942","isNumber":"8389095","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8376942","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8389095","articleId":"8389143","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":8389151,"authors":[{"name":"K.

It is usually carried out through the auctions held by the spectrum licensees themselves or by the designated third parties that collect the vacant channel information from the licensed users. In most of the standard auction methods, range of bidding prices can be very wide, with no restriction on maximum and minimum bidding values. This situation can create instability in channel pricing that can lead to underutilization of vacant bandwidths. An auction scheme, in which predefined maximum and minimum bid values can be used, is proposed in this work. It also proposes to offer reduction in allocation prices, based on the prevailing demand and supply of vacant channels, at various times. Simulation results indicate that the proposed scheme offers better performance in comparison with other existing auction methods, in supporting the Quality of Service (QoS) of cognitive radio users, and in stabilizing the pricing of channels.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"21-23 Dec. 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8389151/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"17858862","publicationDate":"Dec. 2017","conferenceDate":"21-23 Dec. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8389151/","dateOfInsertion":"21 June 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Range-bound pricing of channels in multichannel multiuser cognitive radio networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Range-bound pricing of channels in multichannel multiuser cognitive radio networks","confLoc":"Tumkur, India","sourcePdf":"RP055011.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.090199S","chronDate":"21-23 Dec. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8376942","isNumber":"8389095","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8376942","xplore-issue":"8389095","articleId":"8389151","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8389160,"authors":[{"name":"Deepa Saini","affiliation":["Department of ECE, R.I.E.T, Jaipur, India"],"firstName":"Deepa","lastName":"Saini"},{"name":"Ajay Rupani","affiliation":["Department of ECE R.I.E.T, Jaipur, India"],"firstName":"Ajay","lastName":"Rupani","id":"37086100830"},{"name":"Gajendra Sujediya","affiliation":["Department of ECE, J.I.E.T, Jodhpur, India"],"firstName":"Gajendra","lastName":"Sujediya","id":"37086097599"},{"name":"Tushar Sharma","affiliation":["Amity School of Engineering and Technology, Amity University, Uttar Pradesh, India"],"firstName":"Tushar","lastName":"Sharma","id":"37086400126"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1144-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1143-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1145-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8389160","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":227},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8389160","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Communications technology","Handheld computers","Conferences"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["analogue-digital conversion","calibration","chemical sensors","computerised instrumentation","digital-analogue conversion","field programmable gate arrays","ion sensitive field effect transistors","Matlab","neural nets","pH measurement","table lookup"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["pH measurement","ISFET automated output calibration system","TPS","water quality measurement","ION sensitive chemical measurement","artificial intelligence","ADC","LUT","look up table","DAC","artificial neural network","fly calibration system","reconfigurable FPGA hardware architecture","ISFET pH sensor","biological measurements","ion based sensing applications","MATLAB artificial intelligence interfacing","reconfigurable FPGA device"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Artificial Intelligence","ISFET pH Sensor","Semiconductor pH SensorAuto Calibration"]}],"abstract":"ISFET area is a promising technology developed recently, with widespread application in ion based sensing applications such as PH measurement, TPS & water quality measurement & other ION sensitive chemical and biological measurements.

With the advent of deep learning, several approaches for monocular depth estimation have been proposed, all of which have inherent limitations due to the scarce depth cues that exist in a single image. Moreover, these methods are very demanding computationally, which makes them inadequate for systems with limited processing power. In this paper, a phase-coded aperture camera for depth estimation is proposed. The camera is equipped with an optical phase mask that provides unambiguous depth-related color characteristics for the captured image. These are used for estimating the scene depth map using a fully convolutional neural network. The phase-coded aperture structure is learned jointly with the network weights using backpropagation. The strong depth cues (encoded in the image by the phase mask, designed together with the network weights) allow a much simpler neural network architecture for faster and more accurate depth estimation. Performance achieved on simulated images as well as on a real optical setup is superior to the state-of-the-art monocular depth estimation methods (both with respect to the depth accuracy and required processing power), and is competitive with more complex and expensive depth estimation methods such as light-field cameras.","doi":"10.1109/TCI.2018.2849326","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCI.2018.2849326","startPage":"298","endPage":"310","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computational Imaging","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computational Imaging","pdfPath":"/iel7/6745852/8436466/08389203.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8436466","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Depth Estimation From a Single Image Using Deep Learned Phase Coded Mask","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8389203/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2018","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 June 2018","displayDocTitle":"Depth Estimation From a Single Image Using Deep Learned Phase Coded Mask","volume":"4","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"14 August 2018","accessionNumber":"18025477","publicationDate":"Sept. 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8389203/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"NVIDIA's"},{"fundingName":"ERC-StG SPADE"},{"fundingName":"ERC-StG RAPID"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Depth Estimation From a Single Image Using Deep Learned Phase Coded Mask","sourcePdf":"tci-elmalem-2849326-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.080754S","chronDate":"Sept.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"6745852","isNumber":"8436466","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6745852","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"8436466","articleId":"8389203","onlineDate":"20 June 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":8389206,"authors":[{"name":"Ziqiang Zheng","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Ocean University of China, Qingdao, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/8274985/8389206/zzhen-2849108-small.gif","p":["Ziqiang Zheng is currently pursuing the bachelor\u2019s degree with the Ocean University of China.

How to enhance the synthesis image equality while maintaining the stochasticity of the GAN remains a challenge. We propose a novel denoising framework to handle this problem. The generation of overlapping objects is another challenging task when synthesizing images from a semantic layout to a realistic RGB photograph. To overcome this deficiency, we include a one-hot semantic label map to force the generator to pay more attention to the generation of overlapping objects. Furthermore, we improve the loss function of the discriminator by considering the perturbed loss and cascade layer loss to guide the generation process. We applied our methods to the Cityscapes, photo-sketch, day-night, facades, and NYU datasets to demonstrate the image generation ability of our model.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8389206/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 June 2018","chronOrPublicationDate":"2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","publicationDate":"2018","accessionNumber":"17886080","htmlLink":"/document/8389206/","isJournal":true,"isOpenAccess":true,"dateOfInsertion":"04 July 2018","volume":"6","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Instance Map Based Image Synthesis With a Denoising Generative Adversarial Network","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61701463"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002858","fundingName":"China Postdoctoral Science Foundation","grantNumber":"2017M622277"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100007129","fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of Shandong Province","grantNumber":"ZR2017BF011"},{"fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities","grantNumber":"201713019"},{"fundingName":"Qingdao Postdoctoral Science Foundation of China"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100007065","fundingName":"Nvidia"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Instance Map Based Image Synthesis With a Denoising Generative Adversarial Network","sourcePdf":"access-yu-2849108-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.109867S","chronDate":"2018","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"8274985","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"8274985","articleId":"8389206","onlineDate":"20 June 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8389211,"authors":[{"name":"Anthony Ngozichukwuka Uwaechia","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University of Science Malaysia, Nibon Terbal, Malaysia"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4267003/8811839/8389211/uwaec-2837353-small.gif","p":["Anthony Ngozichukwuka Uwaechia received the B.Eng. and M.Sc. degrees from Ahmadu Bello University, Zaria, Nigeria, in 2006 and 2013, respectively.

Since tractable recovery algorithm is a crucial and major issue of CS, the greedy pursuit (GP) algorithms are generally preferred to enable accurate reconstruction of sparse or compressible signals from very few noisy incoherent measurements. While selecting multiple \u201ccorrect\u201d indices per iteration to improve the running time of orthogonal matching pursuit algorithm, the chosen indices are usually not the optimal one due to the iterative short-sighted decisions. In this paper, since the demand for fast reconstruction algorithms-possibly operating in linear time-is of significant interest, an algorithm namely, stage-determined matching pursuit (SdMP) is proposed. The SdMP algorithm exploits the selection of few indices (below the target signal sparsity level) per iteration, and then combines a backtracking or pruning step in some later iterations-albeit after satisfying a sparsity level conditions to refine the selected set. Using the restricted isometry property, the theoretical analysis of the SdMP algorithm and the sufficient conditions (guarantees) for realizing an improved reconstruction performance are presented. Through numerical simulations, it is shown that SdMP outperforms many GP algorithms that select multiple indices per iteration in terms of reconstruction accuracy and the running speed.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Systems Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/4267003/8811839/08389211.pdf","startPage":"2240","endPage":"2251","publicationTitle":"IEEE Systems Journal","doi":"10.1109/JSYST.2018.2837353","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSYST.2018.2837353","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8811839","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8389211","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Stage-Determined Matching Pursuit for Sparse Channel Estimation in OFDM Systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Matching pursuit algorithms","OFDM","Signal processing algorithms","Sparse matrices","Discrete Fourier transforms","Optimization","Channel estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","compressed sensing","greedy algorithms","iterative methods","OFDM modulation","signal reconstruction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["sampling paradigm","incoherent linear measurements","compressed sensing","tractable recovery algorithm","greedy pursuit algorithms","sparse signals","compressible signals","noisy incoherent measurements","multiple correct indices","orthogonal matching pursuit algorithm","SdMP algorithm","target signal sparsity level","sparsity level conditions","improved reconstruction performance","GP algorithms","reconstruction accuracy","stage-determined matching pursuit","sparse channel estimation","OFDM systems","fast reconstruction algorithms","iterative short-sighted decisions","restricted isometry property"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Channel estimation (CE)","compressed sensing (CS)","greedy algorithms","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM)","signal reconstruction","signal representations","sparse matrices"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8389211/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2019","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 June 2018","displayDocTitle":"Stage-Determined Matching Pursuit for Sparse Channel Estimation in OFDM Systems","volume":"13","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/8389211/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2019","accessionNumber":"18937393","dateOfInsertion":"23 August 2019","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004595","fundingName":"Universiti Sains Malaysia","grantNumber":"FRGS 203/PELECT/6071373"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Stage-Determined Matching Pursuit for Sparse Channel Estimation in OFDM Systems","sourcePdf":"jsyst-uwaechia-2837353-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.121481S","chronDate":"Sept.  2019","xplore-pub-id":"4267003","isNumber":"8811839","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4267003","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"8811839","articleId":"8389211","onlineDate":"20 June 2018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":8389240,"authors":[{"name":"Karuna B.

It combines MIMO technology, which multiplies capacity by transmitting different signals over multiple antennas, and OFDM which divides a radio channel into a large number of closely spaced sub-channels to provide more reliable communications at high speeds. Nevertheless, MIMO system experiences the inter-symbol interference (ISI) effects particularly in high data rate transmissions in which the system performance is extremely degraded. Thus far, Space Time Block coded (STBC) orthogonal frequency division multiplexing is a most reliable technique to attain bandwidth efficiency and ISI suppression ability. In our present work, the performance of different adaptive modulation scheme is analyzed. Also the theoretical and simulated result of BER (Bit error rate) is analyzed for different antenna configuration and finally it is investigated that the simulation result for MIMO-OFDM configuration with Alamouti STBC gives better performance where the SNR gain is 10dB at the BER value 10\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">-4</sup>\n and 7dB at the BER value of 10\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">-3</sup>\n.

The D2D users reuse the resource block of cellular users (CU) which create interference to each other. This reduces the network throughput. In the dynamic network condition, the D2D communicating devices leave their positions and direct D2D communication is not possible, devices required another device (relay) for further communication in D2D mode. This makes a two hop D2D communication (source-to-relay and relay-to-destination). In the random resource allocation scheme, the eNodeB/base station (BS) allocates the resource block without considering the interference at the relay and destination end. This reduces the network throughput. In order to reduce the interference, a resource allocation method with minimum interference for two-hop D2D communications for the 5G cellular network has been proposed. In this scheme, initially, the BS calculates the interference over each resource block at the relay and destination side. Once, the BS calculates the interference, it allocates that resource block that creates less interference compared to other resource block. In case of resource allocation, the BS gives the high priority to that resource block that creates less interference. Our analysis and result demonstrate that our scheme perform better compared to random allocation scheme.","doi":"10.1109/ISS1.2017.8389375","publicationTitle":"2017 International Conference on Intelligent Sustainable Systems (ICISS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 International Conference on Intelligent Sustainable Systems (ICISS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8376163/8389225/08389375.pdf","startPage":"1191","endPage":"1196","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISS1.2017.8389375","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8389225","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Minimum interference based resource allocation method in two-hop D2D communication for 5G cellular networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8389375/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-8 Dec. 2017","displayDocTitle":"Minimum interference based resource allocation method in two-hop D2D communication for 5G cellular networks","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2017","accessionNumber":"17858462","htmlLink":"/document/8389375/","dateOfInsertion":"21 June 2018","conferenceDate":"7-8 Dec. 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Minimum interference based resource allocation method in two-hop D2D communication for 5G cellular networks","confLoc":"Palladam, India","sourcePdf":"233.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.083029S","chronDate":"7-8 Dec. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8376163","isNumber":"8389225","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8376163","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"8389225","articleId":"8389375","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-09"},{"_id":8389437,"authors":[{"name":"Carlin C.F.

Previous studies were always based on shallow network structures (i.e. 3-5 layers) and used time-lagged data from the localized region as model inputs. Recent ecological studies have shown that the coastal ocean current circulation is one of the key factors for the formation of algae bloom (red tide), hence the level of chlorophyll-a concentration increases. This suggests that the data from nearby regions should be included in the modeling process along with the localized data. This study investigates the classification performance among models with and without the use of data from nearby regions under deep neural network learning models. Networks with 3 to 12 layers are employed in two distinct structures respectively for conducting the empirical analysis on 1990-2016 monthly marine water quality data obtained from the Hong Kong Environmental Protection Department. The deep networks are shown to be able to extract useful information from 108 input attributes consolidated from 5 nearby coastal regions in Deep Bay water control zone. The 5-fold cross valuation results indicated that the use of additional layers tends to improve the classification performance and the optimal result is achieved by using 11 layers under the two proposed network structures.","doi":"10.1109/ISS1.2017.8389437","startPage":"389","endPage":"394","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 International Conference on Intelligent Sustainable Systems (ICISS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8376163/8389225/08389437.pdf","publicationTitle":"2017 International Conference on Intelligent Sustainable Systems (ICISS)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISS1.2017.8389437","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8389225","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Deep neural network for marine water quality classification with the consideration of coastal current circulation effect","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Conferences"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ecology","environmental science computing","learning (artificial intelligence)","neural nets","oceanographic techniques","tides","water quality"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["marine water quality classification","coastal current circulation effect","shallow network structures","localized region","model inputs","coastal ocean current circulation","algae bloom","red tide","chlorophyll-a concentration increases","localized data","classification performance","deep neural network learning models","distinct structures","Hong Kong Environmental Protection Department","deep networks","5 nearby coastal regions","Deep Bay water control zone","5-fold cross valuation results","ecological studies","monthly marine water quality data"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Deep Network","Machine Learning","Red tide","Chlorophyll-a prediction","Coastal ocean current circulation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8389437/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-8 Dec. 2017","displayDocTitle":"Deep neural network for marine water quality classification with the consideration of coastal current circulation effect","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8389437/","publicationDate":"Dec. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"21 June 2018","conferenceDate":"7-8 Dec. 2017","accessionNumber":"17858559","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Deep neural network for marine water quality classification with the consideration of coastal current circulation effect","confLoc":"Palladam, India","sourcePdf":"72.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062218S","chronDate":"7-8 Dec. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8376163","isNumber":"8389225","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8376163","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"8389225","articleId":"8389437","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-12"},{"_id":8389441,"authors":[{"name":"Sharath Chandra Inguva","affiliation":["GITAM University, Visakhapatnam, Andhra Pradesh, IN"],"firstName":"Sharath Chandra","lastName":"Inguva"},{"name":"J.

In the recent era, the internet infrastructure relies on the cloud for their business and the cloud deployment model is inevitable. The important aspects of the cloud infrastructure are confidentiality, integrity, availability and accessibility. Availability is one of the major concern in providing services to the cloud users without disruption. There exists security and privacy issues in the cloud that affects the cloud utilities. Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack is one of the major cloud security attack that needs utmost consideration. The cloud resources are degraded and the access to critical services are denied to genuine users leading to severe financial loss, data theft and non-repudiation. The article provides an overview of the DDoS attacks in cloud, recent trends and the existing methodologies that are adopted for ensuring cloud security. The threats alarming the security in cloud and the DDoS detection and mitigation methods are discussed and compared to comprehend the significance of the current deployed solutions.

The MIMO-OFDM technology aims at providing bandwidth efficient, higher capacity and higher data rate services to the customers. But, the major hindrance for OFDM is its high Peak to Average Power Ratio (PAPR). PAPR is the ratio of the high peak power to the average power of OFDM symbols. Various techniques have been deployed to reduce the PAPR such as Toning, Selective Level Mapping (SLM), Partial Transmit Sequence (PTS), Clipping and Filtering and Windowing. In this paper we present our optimized precoding and companding technique to optimize the PAPR and Bit Error Rate (BER) for WiMAX system. From the result, it is shown that the combination of precoding and Mu-law companding with QAM mapping technique provides better PAPR reduction. Simulations are carried out in MATLAB tool for different systems. From the results, it is observed that our proposed algorithm gives PAPR value of 1.7 dB which is 0.6 dB lesser than 2.3 dB.","doi":"10.1109/ICECDS.2017.8389508","publicationTitle":"2017 International Conference on Energy, Communication, Data Analytics and Soft Computing (ICECDS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 International Conference on Energy, Communication, Data Analytics and Soft Computing (ICECDS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8379907/8389494/08389508.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICECDS.2017.8389508","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8389494","startPage":"603","endPage":"607","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"PAPR optimization in MIMO-OFDM system for WiMAX","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8389508","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"PAPR optimization in MIMO-OFDM system for WiMAX","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-2 Aug. 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8389508/","conferenceDate":"1-2 Aug. 2017","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2017","accessionNumber":"17859087","dateOfInsertion":"21 June 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8389508/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"PAPR optimization in MIMO-OFDM system for WiMAX","confLoc":"Chennai, India","sourcePdf":"110.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.126894S","chronDate":"1-2 Aug. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8379907","isNumber":"8389494","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8379907","xplore-issue":"8389494","articleId":"8389508","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8389533,"authors":[{"name":"Limnd T.

There are various proven LDPC decoder algorithms such as Log domain sum product algorithm(LDSPA), Min sum decoder (MSD), Single scan min sum decoder(SSMSD) and normalized single scan min sum decoder(NSSMSD) which are currently in use. Each of these algorithm have its own distinct pros and cons from implementation point of view that comes to support various transmission standards. In this paper four LDPC decoding algorithms are implemented to test and support CDTMB standard for its three code rates viz. 0.4, 0.6 and 0.8. The performance evaluation of all four decoder algorithms mentioned above are carried out with Additive White Gaussian Noise(AWGN) channel with BPSK modulation scheme. The software implementation of these algorithms show that min sum decoder algorithm reduces complexity when compared to LDSPA. Also SSMSD and NSSMSD contributes to conservation of memory to 23% and take at least 35% less computation time compared to LDSPA and MSD. LDSPA is preferred for low data rate applications for its good BER performance, but it has the drawback of increase in hardware complexity due to the presence of tanh and log functions. SSMSD and NSSMSD is preferable for high data rate applications as this showed low memory requirement and faster performance.","doi":"10.1109/ICECDS.2017.8389609","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICECDS.2017.8389609","startPage":"1092","endPage":"1097","publicationTitle":"2017 International Conference on Energy, Communication, Data Analytics and Soft Computing (ICECDS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 International Conference on Energy, Communication, Data Analytics and Soft Computing (ICECDS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8379907/8389494/08389609.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8389494","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A comparison and simulation of LDPC decoders for Chinese digital television multimedia broadcasting(CDTMB) standard","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8389609/","conferenceDate":"1-2 Aug. 2017","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-2 Aug. 2017","displayDocTitle":"A comparison and simulation of LDPC decoders for Chinese digital television multimedia broadcasting(CDTMB) standard","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"21 June 2018","accessionNumber":"17859228","publicationDate":"Aug. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8389609/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A comparison and simulation of LDPC decoders for Chinese digital television multimedia broadcasting(CDTMB) standard","confLoc":"Chennai, India","sourcePdf":"201.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061824S","chronDate":"1-2 Aug. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8379907","isNumber":"8389494","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8379907","xplore-issue":"8389494","articleId":"8389609","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-21"},{"_id":8389641,"authors":[{"name":"N Praveen Kumar","affiliation":["Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham, Coimbatore, Tamil Nadu, IN"],"firstName":"N Praveen","lastName":"Kumar","id":"37086830995"},{"name":"R Sreemathi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Amrita University, Coimbatore, India"],"firstName":"R","lastName":"Sreemathi","id":"37086398526"},{"name":"K P Ragul Chandar","affiliation":["Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham, Coimbatore, Tamil Nadu, IN"],"firstName":"K P Ragul","lastName":"Chandar","id":"37087574648"},{"name":"V Vaijayanthi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Amrita University, Coimbatore, India"],"firstName":"V","lastName":"Vaijayanthi","id":"37086400236"},{"name":"S Praveen Kumar","affiliation":["Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham, Coimbatore, Tamil Nadu, IN"],"firstName":"S Praveen","lastName":"Kumar","id":"37087414360"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1887-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1888-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8389641","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":205},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Circuit faults","Inverters","Switching circuits","Pulse width modulation","Finite element analysis","Insulated gate bipolar transistors","Torque"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["finite element analysis","induction motor drives","power semiconductor switches","PWM invertors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["PWM inverter switch open- circuit fault analysis","FEM","electromagnetic field parameter","IGBT switch","PWM inverter leg","flux distribution","healthy & single switch open circuit faulty condition","three phase induction motor drive","pulse width modulated voltage source inverter","finite element method","three phase IM","ANSYS MAXWELL finite element analysis tool","power 7.5 kW"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Induction Motor (IM)","Finite Element Method (FEM)","pulse width modulation (PWM)","IGBT switch","voltage source fed(VSI)"]}],"abstract":"This paper examines the switch open circuit fault in a Pulse Width Modulated (PWM) Voltage Source Inverter (VSI) fed three phase induction motor (IM) using Finite Element Method (FEM).

However, Inter Carrier Interference (ICI) caused by time varying wireless channel and Peak to Average Power Ratio (PAPR) due to the presence of a large number of subcarriers with varying amplitude are the critical issues faced in OFDM. One of the efficient ICI self-cancellation scheme is correlative precoder but it introduces increased PAPR. To overcome this shortcoming a new form of circulantly precoded OFDM system is implemented to enhance ICI reduce and also employed with Selective Mapping (SLM) which is effective in PAPR reduction and uncomplicated. BER performance of correlative and circulantly precoded OFDM system is evaluated for LMMSE and OLMMSE equalizers. Simulation results show that circulantly precoded OFDM with SLM can achieve jointly better ICI self cancellation and PAPR reduction than correlative precoding technique over time varying channel.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint ICI cancellation and PAPR reduction using circulantly precoded OFDM with SLM","publicationTitle":"2017 International Conference on Energy, Communication, Data Analytics and Soft Computing (ICECDS)","doi":"10.1109/ICECDS.2017.8389643","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 International Conference on Energy, Communication, Data Analytics and Soft Computing (ICECDS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8379907/8389494/08389643.pdf","startPage":"1253","endPage":"1258","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICECDS.2017.8389643","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8389494","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8389643","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8389643/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-2 Aug. 2017","displayDocTitle":"Joint ICI cancellation and PAPR reduction using circulantly precoded OFDM with SLM","conferenceDate":"1-2 Aug. 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8389643/","dateOfInsertion":"21 June 2018","publicationDate":"Aug. 2017","accessionNumber":"17874373","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint ICI cancellation and PAPR reduction using circulantly precoded OFDM with SLM","confLoc":"Chennai, India","sourcePdf":"232.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070757S","chronDate":"1-2 Aug. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8379907","isNumber":"8389494","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8379907","xplore-issue":"8389494","articleId":"8389643","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8389648,"authors":[{"name":"M M Anas","affiliation":["ASSISTANT PROFESSOR ECE DEPARTMENT, MITS, VARIKOLI ERNAKULAM, KERALA"],"firstName":"M M","lastName":"Anas","id":"37086399896"},{"name":"R Sikha Padiyar","affiliation":["Madhav Institute of Technology and Science, Gwalior, Madhya Pradesh, IN"],"firstName":"R Sikha","lastName":"Padiyar"},{"name":"Alisiya Sara Boban","affiliation":["ECE DEPARTMENT, MITS, VARIKOLI ERNAKULAM, KERALA"],"firstName":"Alisiya Sara","lastName":"Boban","id":"37086398863"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1887-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1888-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8389648","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":192},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8389648","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Signal processing algorithms","Adders","Hardware","Logic gates","Data analysis","Transforms","Field programmable gate arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adders","carry logic","logic design","logic gates"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power consumption","ripple carry adder/subtractor","high speed CORDIC algorithm","DSP algorithms"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["CORDIC","sine","cosine","optimised XOR gate"]}],"abstract":"Compared to DSP algorithms, a set of shift or add algorithm collectively called CORDIC algorithm is better both in terms of area and power consumption.

One of the drawbacks of OFDM has been proved to be its high sensitivity to frequency offset which results in Inter carrier Interference. Second problem is to find exact timing of OFDM symbol at the receiver. This is called timing offset estimation. In this paper, an effort has been made to increase the overall performance of MIMO with OFDM system by combating the above mentioned problems of MIMO OFDM. Existing approaches for the frequency-offset estimation using the preamble data, Maximum Likely estimation of frequency and time offsets in OFDM systems using the two sets of identical cyclic prefix data of the received signals have been already proposed. In this paper an interference cancelling algorithm for cancelling time-selectivity induced ICI due to both carrier frequencies in SFBC OFDM systems is proposed to improve the performance.","doi":"10.1109/ICECDS.2017.8389682","publicationTitle":"2017 International Conference on Energy, Communication, Data Analytics and Soft Computing (ICECDS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 International Conference on Energy, Communication, Data Analytics and Soft Computing (ICECDS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8379907/8389494/08389682.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICECDS.2017.8389682","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8389494","startPage":"1437","endPage":"1442","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"ICI cancellation in SFBC-MIMO OFDM with carrier frequency/timing offset over Rayleigh fading channel","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8389682","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"ICI cancellation in SFBC-MIMO OFDM with carrier frequency/timing offset over Rayleigh fading channel","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-2 Aug. 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8389682/","conferenceDate":"1-2 Aug. 2017","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2017","accessionNumber":"17859105","dateOfInsertion":"21 June 2018","htmlLink":"/document/8389682/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"ICI cancellation in SFBC-MIMO OFDM with carrier frequency/timing offset over Rayleigh fading channel","confLoc":"Chennai, India","sourcePdf":"268.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058435S","chronDate":"1-2 Aug. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8379907","isNumber":"8389494","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8379907","xplore-issue":"8389494","articleId":"8389682","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8389690,"authors":[{"name":"Sarala Patchala","affiliation":["Jawaharlal Nehru Technological University, Hyderabad, Telangana, IN"],"firstName":"Sarala","lastName":"Patchala"},{"name":"M.

In this paper, a threshold facial region of an image is detected and preprocessing is done based through the image excellence. If the selected face is frontal face with good lighting, extract the prerequisite features and do the necessary comparison steps to recognize the faces. In case, if the selected face is in bad lighting, then perform histogram equalization and normalization to increase the contrast. Different Poses and expressions are the very challenging zones which require surplus pre-processing to improve the performance of the face recognition system. Hence an enhanced normalization method called 3D Morphable Model are used as a pre- processing technique to create a frontal view from a non-frontal view and also merge images with different views in to a single frontal view. Next to diminish the number of features used for recognition process; we emulate the linear discriminant analysis method for further classification. Eventually, we used an open-source Hadoop Image Processing Interface (HIPI) to act as an interface for MapReduce technology for recognition.","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 International Conference on Energy, Communication, Data Analytics and Soft Computing (ICECDS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8379907/8389494/08389776.pdf","startPage":"1882","endPage":"1885","publicationTitle":"2017 International Conference on Energy, Communication, Data Analytics and Soft Computing (ICECDS)","doi":"10.1109/ICECDS.2017.8389776","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICECDS.2017.8389776","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8389494","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8389776","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"3D face recognition using Hadoop","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Face","Face recognition","Three-dimensional displays","Lighting","Feature extraction","Solid modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biometrics (access control)","face recognition","feature extraction","parallel processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["frontal face","biometric technique","3D face recognition method","histogram equalization","surplus preprocessing","enhanced normalization method","3D morphable model","single frontal view","nonfrontal view","linear discriminant analysis method","open-source Hadoop image processing interface","HIPI","MapReduce technology"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Hadoop","Image Processing","Map Reduce","Linear Discriminant analysis"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8389776/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-2 Aug. 2017","displayDocTitle":"3D face recognition using Hadoop","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8389776/","publicationDate":"Aug. 2017","accessionNumber":"17859481","dateOfInsertion":"21 June 2018","conferenceDate":"1-2 Aug. 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"3D face recognition using Hadoop","confLoc":"Chennai, India","sourcePdf":"352.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.080268S","chronDate":"1-2 Aug. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8379907","isNumber":"8389494","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8379907","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"8389494","articleId":"8389776","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8389778,"authors":[{"name":"Jicy Ann Thomas","affiliation":["Dept. of Electronics and Communication Engineering FISAT Angamaly, India"],"firstName":"Jicy Ann","lastName":"Thomas","id":"37086401784"},{"name":"P R.

These requirements can be fulfilled by using a Smart antenna system. Beamforming is a technique which is used in smart antennas for enhanced signal transmission and reception. This paper deals with the MUSIC algorithm for estimating the unknown direction of arrival (DOA) of incoming signals and three adaptive beamforming techniques namely Least Mean Square (LMS), Normalized Least Mean Square (NLMS) and Recursive Least Square (RLS). These algorithms are simulated in MATLAB and a Graphical User Interface (GUI) is created for better analysis.","doi":"10.1109/ICECDS.2017.8389778","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 International Conference on Energy, Communication, Data Analytics and Soft Computing (ICECDS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8379907/8389494/08389778.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8389494","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICECDS.2017.8389778","publicationTitle":"2017 International Conference on Energy, Communication, Data Analytics and Soft Computing (ICECDS)","startPage":"1890","endPage":"1896","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"DOA estimation and adaptive beamforming using MATLAB and GUI","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8389778","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-2 Aug. 2017","displayDocTitle":"DOA estimation and adaptive beamforming using MATLAB and GUI","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8389778/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/8389778/","publicationDate":"Aug. 2017","accessionNumber":"17859202","dateOfInsertion":"21 June 2018","conferenceDate":"1-2 Aug. 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"DOA estimation and adaptive beamforming using MATLAB and GUI","confLoc":"Chennai, India","sourcePdf":"354.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065245S","chronDate":"1-2 Aug. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8379907","isNumber":"8389494","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8379907","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"8389494","articleId":"8389778","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8389822,"authors":[{"name":"Rajendra Bahadur Singh","affiliation":["Dept. of Electronics & Communication, Gautam Buddha University, Greater Noida, INDIA"],"firstName":"Rajendra Bahadur","lastName":"Singh","id":"37085906155"},{"name":"Anurag Singh Baghel","affiliation":["Gautam Buddha University, Greater Noida, Uttar Pradesh, IN"],"firstName":"Anurag Singh","lastName":"Baghel","id":"37085384301"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1887-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1888-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8389822","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":343},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8389822","abstract":"In the VLSI physical design, Floorplanning is very important step as it optimizes the circuit.

To reduce the power consumption, we can consider multiple supply voltages. In this paper, we propose the radiation-hardened Static Random Access Memory (SRAM) bit cell targeted at low-voltage functionality, while maintaining high soft-error robustness. The proposed SRAM employs a novel dual-driven separated-feedback mechanism with multiple supply voltages to tolerate upsets with charge deposits at a scaled 500-mV supply voltage. In this paper, a novel modified Static Random Access Memory (SRAM) cell based CMOS Schmitt trigger inverter designed for memory architectures which maintain high soft-error robustness is proposed. The Stability of CMOS Schmitt trigger inverter is more compared to basic CMOS inverter. The Proposed SRAM cell reduces delay by 65-70% and power by 80-85% and increases read stability by 60-70% compared to 13T SRAM cell based memory architecture.

In this study, different classification algorithms are established to classify the different medical datasets and compared the results obtained by using the particle swarm optimization (PSO), the classification accuracy. Particle swarm optimization is a developed algorithm that explains the movement of group of birds in space in mathematical terms. In PSO, each potential problem is viewed as an element with specific velocity that flies through a problem space as if it was a flock of bird. In this paper we present a literary review of papers on PSO and record its way through inception and implementing it in different physical problems. We present a comparative table of implementation for PSO and review PSO success in various fields of science. The suggested method is tested on several standard data sets at UCI database and its performance is compared with those of Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) using classifiers.

This entire work is performed on Xilinx ISE 14.7 and implemented on FPGA Xilinx vertex6 xc6vlx760-2ff1760.","doi":"10.1109/ICECDS.2017.8389955","publicationTitle":"2017 International Conference on Energy, Communication, Data Analytics and Soft Computing (ICECDS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 International Conference on Energy, Communication, Data Analytics and Soft Computing (ICECDS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8379907/8389494/08389955.pdf","startPage":"2748","endPage":"2753","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICECDS.2017.8389955","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8389494","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Impact of datapath unit for an efficient implementation of FFT processor","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8389955","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-2 Aug. 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8389955/","displayDocTitle":"Impact of datapath unit for an efficient implementation of FFT processor","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2017","accessionNumber":"17859428","htmlLink":"/document/8389955/","conferenceDate":"1-2 Aug. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"21 June 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Impact of datapath unit for an efficient implementation of FFT processor","confLoc":"Chennai, India","sourcePdf":"513.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.075762S","chronDate":"1-2 Aug. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8379907","isNumber":"8389494","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8379907","xplore-issue":"8389494","articleId":"8389955","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":8389957,"authors":[{"name":"Ankita Lasod","affiliation":["Dept. of CSE, Rajasthan Technical University, Kota, India"],"firstName":"Ankita","lastName":"Lasod","id":"37086400531"},{"name":"Dinesh Soni","affiliation":["Dept. of CSE, Rajasthan Technical University, Kota, India"],"firstName":"Dinesh","lastName":"Soni","id":"37086403055"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1887-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1888-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8389957","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":266},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image recognition","Artificial neural networks","Biological neural networks","Feature extraction","Machine learning","Neurons"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image recognition","learning (artificial intelligence)","neural nets","support vector machines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["efficiency enhancement","food recognition","artificial neural network","deep learning","food location","publically available food-logging framework","food image discovery","image recognition system","ANN","support-vector-machine","food pictures recognization","handmade choices","convolution bits"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Artificial neural network","SVM","Food image recognition"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8389957","abstract":"In this paper, we have a tendency to apply a artificial neural network (ANN) to the tasks of detective work and recognizing food pictures. Be- explanation for the wide diversity of styles of food, image recognition of food things is usually terribly difficulties. Be that as it may, deep learning has been indicated as of late to be a truly intense image recognition system, and ANN could be a dynamic way to deal with deep learning. We tend to connected ANN to the errands of food location and recognition through parameter change. We tend to made a dataset of the preeminent incessant food things in a publically available food-logging framework, and utilized it to recognition execution. ANN demonstrated fundamentally higher accuracy than did antiquated support-vector-machine-based routes with handmade choices. Furthermore, we tend to establish that the convolution bits demonstrate that shading commands the component extraction strategy. For food image discovery, ANN also indicated fundamentally higher accuracy than a customary procedure. Fundamentally higher accuracy than a customary strategy.","doi":"10.1109/ICECDS.2017.8389957","pdfPath":"/iel7/8379907/8389494/08389957.pdf","startPage":"2758","endPage":"2762","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 International Conference on Energy, Communication, Data Analytics and Soft Computing (ICECDS)","publicationTitle":"2017 International Conference on Energy, Communication, Data Analytics and Soft Computing (ICECDS)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICECDS.2017.8389957","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8389494","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficiency enhancement of food recognition using artificial neural network","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8389957/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-2 Aug. 2017","displayDocTitle":"Efficiency enhancement of food recognition using artificial neural network","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"21 June 2018","accessionNumber":"17859016","publicationDate":"Aug. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/8389957/","conferenceDate":"1-2 Aug. 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficiency enhancement of food recognition using artificial neural network","confLoc":"Chennai, India","sourcePdf":"515.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073668S","chronDate":"1-2 Aug. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8379907","isNumber":"8389494","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8379907","xplore-issue":"8389494","articleId":"8389957","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":8389977,"authors":[{"name":"Arjun Ghule","affiliation":["Department of ECE, Jawaharlal Nehru Technological University, Hyderabad, India"],"firstName":"Arjun","lastName":"Ghule","id":"37086401280"},{"name":"Prabhu Benakop","affiliation":["Indur Institute of Engineering & Technology, Siddipet Telangana, India"],"firstName":"Prabhu","lastName":"Benakop"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1887-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5386-1888-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"8389977","dbTime":"16 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":33},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Network coding","Packet loss","Delays","Data analysis","Monitoring","Internet telephony"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["network coding","speech recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["performance evaluation","packet erasure network","speech data","packet combinations","PEN","speech recognition quality","Network Coding simulations","butterfly network","transmitted packets","received packet pattern","Automatic Speech Recognition systems","ASR","network coding simulations"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Butterfly Network","Speech Quality","Packet Erasure Network(PEN)","Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) etc"]}],"abstract":"In Packet Erasure network large amount of data is getting lost during transmission. This may pose question on the quality of received data which is severely degraded. Its a major concern in communication systems, especially in Automatic Speech Recognition systems(ASR), Where loosing of speech data over such network will affect the accuracy of ASR. In this paper author has proposed to choose optimized total number of packet combinations per generation for the transmission via Packet Erasure Network (PEN)[21]. The Problem of evaluation of the speech recognition quality over PEN has been addressed in this paper. The author has proposed to perform the automated task, and its implementation automatically over PEN[1]. Network Coding simulations are being performed on a butterfly network. Parameters such as packet, generation size and number of transmitted packets can be changed. Received packet pattern and packet loss rate at each sink node are given as the output.","doi":"10.1109/ICECDS.2017.8389977","publicationTitle":"2017 International Conference on Energy, Communication, Data Analytics and Soft Computing (ICECDS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2017 International Conference on Energy, Communication, Data Analytics and Soft Computing (ICECDS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/8379907/8389494/08389977.pdf","startPage":"2855","endPage":"2859","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICECDS.2017.8389977","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8389494","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance evaluation of packet erasure network","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8389977","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-2 Aug. 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/8389977/","displayDocTitle":"Performance evaluation of packet erasure network","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2017","accessionNumber":"17859376","htmlLink":"/document/8389977/","conferenceDate":"1-2 Aug. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"21 June 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance evaluation of packet erasure network","confLoc":"Chennai, India","sourcePdf":"533.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065148S","chronDate":"1-2 Aug. 2017","xplore-pub-id":"8379907","isNumber":"8389494","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"8379907","xplore-issue":"8389494","articleId":"8389977","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"}]
