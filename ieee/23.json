These filters consist of two cascaded parts. The first part is a parallel connection of two or three branches with transfer function of the form A/sub k/(z)B/sub k/) (z/sup D/), where D is the sampling rate conversion ratio. The second part has a transfer function of the form C(z/sup D/). The advantage of these designs is that they provide a significant reduction in the multiplication and addition rates as well as in the number of required multipliers over the equivalent conventional direct-form designs also in cases where D is a prime number. In these cases, the sampling rate conversion cannot be performed in several stages and many of the other existing designs lose their advantages. Special multiplier-free solutions are generated for implementing the filters A/sub k/(z), resulting in dramatic savings. Several examples are included showing the efficiency of the proposed filters compared to other existing designs.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Finite impulse response filter","Sampling methods","Delay","Passband","Niobium","USA Councils","Baseband","Shape","Transfer functions","Interpolation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["digital filters","filtering and prediction theory","transfer functions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FIR filters","sampling rate conversion","linear-phase","finite impulse response","digital filters","cascaded parts","transfer function","multiplier-free solutions"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.1992.230049","publicationTitle":"[Proceedings] 1992 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"[Proceedings] 1992 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel2/640/5936/00230049.pdf","startPage":"1007","endPage":"1010 vol.2","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5936","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.1992.230049","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multiple branch FIR filters for sampling rate conversion","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=230049","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Multiple branch FIR filters for sampling rate conversion","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/230049/","isConference":true,"volume":"2","publicationDate":"1992","accessionNumber":"4411739","conferenceDate":"10-13 May 1992","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-13 May 1992","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multiple branch FIR filters for sampling rate conversion","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00230049.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.026505S","chronDate":"10-13 May 1992","isNumber":"5936","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"640","citationCount":"4","articleId":"230049","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":230052,"authors":[{"name":"T.

Such a multiscale edge detector is important not only for the usual applications such as pattern recognition and image segmentation, but also for object-based image coding where the reconstruction of the original image from the edges at different scales is made possible by wavelet analysis-synthesis.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.1992.230059","publicationTitle":"[Proceedings] 1992 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"[Proceedings] 1992 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel2/640/5936/00230059.pdf","startPage":"967","endPage":"970 vol.2","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.1992.230059","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5936","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal ramp edge detection by orthogonal wavelet transform","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=230059","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-13 May 1992","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/230059/","displayDocTitle":"Optimal ramp edge detection by orthogonal wavelet transform","volume":"2","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1992","accessionNumber":"4407450","conferenceDate":"10-13 May 1992","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal ramp edge detection by orthogonal wavelet transform","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00230059.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.037599S","chronDate":"10-13 May 1992","isNumber":"5936","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"640","articleId":"230059","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":230063,"authors":[{"name":"H.

They also use these methods to give designs with different p in different frequency bands.<<ETX>>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/230134/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-13 May 1992","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"2","publicationDate":"1992","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4407375","conferenceDate":"10-13 May 1992","displayDocTitle":"Least p-power error design of FIR filters","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Least p-power error design of FIR filters","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00230134.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.029227S","chronDate":"10-13 May 1992","isNumber":"5936","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"640","citationCount":"22","articleId":"230134","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":230136,"authors":[{"name":"Ming Lu","affiliation":["DSP Division, Department of Radio Engineering, South-East University, Nanjing, China"],"lastName":"Ming Lu","id":"37382982700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-0593-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"230136","dbTime":"14 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":92},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Array signal processing","Interpolation","Multiple signal classification","Digital signal processing","Navigation","Radar applications","Sonar applications","High performance computing","Military computing","Filtering"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","interference (signal)","interpolation","matrix algebra"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["synthetic array","virtual linear equispaced array","beamspace Root-MUSIC","algebraic direction-finding","interpolation","matrix beamforming preprocessor","error","SNR resolution threshold","main-lobe beam pattern"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Matrix beamforming preprocessor for beamspace Root-MUSIC","doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.1992.230136","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5936","endPage":"540 vol.2","publicationTitle":"[Proceedings] 1992 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"[Proceedings] 1992 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel2/640/5936/00230136.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.1992.230136","startPage":"537","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=230136","abstract":"The author considers the problem of interpolating a synthetic or virtual linear equispaced (LES) array from a real irregular array to effect some algebraic direction-finding technique such as Root-MUSIC. The interpolation of a virtual LES array can be accomplished through the use of a matrix beamforming preprocessor connected to the output of the real array. The author has considered how to place the 'sensor' of the virtual LES array and the design of the matrix beamforming preprocessor, i.e. the interpolation matrix. In terms of error of the interpolation, the loss of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and SNR resolution threshold, the construction of the virtual LES array is investigated. It is shown that the virtual LES array should have the same main-lobe beam pattern as the real array over an interpolation sector. Numerical results are presented to illustrate virtual LES array interpolation.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/230136/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-13 May 1992","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"2","publicationDate":"1992","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4407373","conferenceDate":"10-13 May 1992","displayDocTitle":"Matrix beamforming preprocessor for beamspace Root-MUSIC","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Matrix beamforming preprocessor for beamspace Root-MUSIC","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00230136.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.020847S","chronDate":"10-13 May 1992","isNumber":"5936","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"640","articleId":"230136","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":230137,"authors":[{"name":"K.

The method is based on two-dimensional filtering for the outputs of a linear array of sensors. To beamform in the broadside of the array, a symmetrical 90 degrees /n filter is employed. The filter in which the angle of fan is more acute can form the narrower beam over the full band while the order of the filter becomes higher. To beamform in the direction along the array, an asymmetrical 45 degrees fan filter is used. As aliasing occurs in this beamforming, the band which is available is limited a little in width. A general implementation of the FIR fan filter beamformer is given as the parallel connection of one-dimensional FIR filters.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-13 May 1992","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/230137/","isConference":true,"volume":"2","accessionNumber":"4407372","publicationDate":"1992","conferenceDate":"10-13 May 1992","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Wideband beamforming using fan filter","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Wideband beamforming using fan filter","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00230137.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060709S","chronDate":"10-13 May 1992","isNumber":"5936","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"640","citationCount":"38","articleId":"230137","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":230142,"authors":[{"name":"W.

Unlike the conventional row-column decomposition method, the proposed system involves no matrix transposition problems. In addition, the system possesses the features of regularity, modularity, and concurrency. As a consequence, it is well suited to VLSI implementation and has a very high throughput of one 2-D transition per N cycles. Moreover, the utilization efficiency of the proposed system is 100%, and the latency (processing time for a single 2-D transform) is 4N-1 cycles.

The memory, where the weights are stored, is implemented digitally to avoid the reliability and long-term preservation problems associated with the current analog storage schemes. The discrete nature of digital weights does not produce any problem in the application considered here, since the weights are pretrained. The number of connections to any layer is reduced to the same number as the neurons in the preceding layer without any loss in generality. The building blocks have been fabricated and tested. A proof-of-concept chip has also been designed in a double metal, single polysilicon, p-well CMOS process. With modest clocking speeds, the circuit will have latency times on the order of microseconds for practical problems.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-13 May 1992","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/230205/","accessionNumber":"4417355","isConference":true,"volume":"3","publicationDate":"1992","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"10-13 May 1992","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A hybrid architecture for feed-forward multi-layer neural networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A hybrid architecture for feed-forward multi-layer neural networks","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00230205.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066745S","chronDate":"10-13 May 1992","isNumber":"5937","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"640","citationCount":"5","articleId":"230205","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":230206,"authors":[{"name":"S.

Components for a delta-sigma modulator are designed and fabricated in a depletion-mode GaAs MESFET technology. They are individually characterized and are integrated together into a second-order delta-sigma modulator. Valuable design principles are recommended for future GaAs delta-sigma modulators. Although it did not meet its initial goals, the first attempt demonstrates the modulator's noise shaping ability, which enables it to perform beyond the precision of the individual GaAs components. The modulator achieved 9-10-b performance for a 200-MHz sampling rate and 2-MHz output word rate. Components such as the comparator and 1-b DAC (digital-to-analog converter) limited the performance of the modulator. Nevertheless, corrections and improvements were identified for future GaAs delta-sigma modulator components.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Gallium arsenide","Delta modulation","Analog-digital conversion","Filters","Dynamic range","Noise shaping","Baseband","MESFETs","Quantization","Bandwidth"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["analogue-digital conversion","delta modulation","field effect integrated circuits","gallium arsenide","III-V semiconductors","modulators","Schottky gate field effect transistors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["oversampled ADC","delta-sigma modulator","depletion-mode","MESFET technology","second-order","noise shaping ability","comparator","DAC","200 MHz","2 MHz","GaAs"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.1992.230266","publicationTitle":"[Proceedings] 1992 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"[Proceedings] 1992 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel2/640/5937/00230266.pdf","startPage":"1300","endPage":"1303 vol.3","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5937","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.1992.230266","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Components for a GaAs delta-sigma modulator oversampled analog-to-digital converter","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=230266","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Components for a GaAs delta-sigma modulator oversampled analog-to-digital converter","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/230266/","isConference":true,"volume":"3","publicationDate":"1992","accessionNumber":"4411777","conferenceDate":"10-13 May 1992","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-13 May 1992","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Components for a GaAs delta-sigma modulator oversampled analog-to-digital converter","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00230266.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.02626S","chronDate":"10-13 May 1992","isNumber":"5937","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"640","citationCount":"9","articleId":"230266","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":230286,"authors":[{"name":"K.

Multirate SC filter design is an effective means of minimizing silicon area for bandpass systems. The theory derived allows designs to achieve maximal area savings by employing sampling rates approaching the minimum allowed by sampling theory. Designing filters to simultaneously operate at different sampling rates can require numerical optimization to correct for the effects of multirate operation, filtorX, a computer-aided filter design tool, was employed to design a CCITT V.22 high-band modem filter as a test of the derived design methodology. The result was an improvement of the uncorrected multirate filter, which had exceeded passband tolerances, to one which was within tolerances. The multirate filter, operating at sampling rates of 128 kHz and 8 kHz, required 70% less capacitor area than the equivalent single-rate filter operating at a sampling rate of 128 kHz.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Capacitors","Sampling methods","Frequency","Band pass filters","Clocks","Passband","Poles and zeros","Transfer functions","Electronic mail","Silicon"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["band-pass filters","circuit CAD","sampled data systems","switched capacitor filters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multirate SC filter","switched capacitor filter design","aggressive sampling-rates","filtorX","silicon area","bandpass systems","computer-aided filter design tool","CCITT V.22 high-band modem filter","passband tolerances"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.1992.230314","publicationTitle":"[Proceedings] 1992 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"[Proceedings] 1992 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel2/640/5937/00230314.pdf","startPage":"1183","endPage":"1186 vol.3","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5937","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.1992.230314","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multi-rate switched capacitor filter design with aggressive sampling-rates: filtorX in action","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=230314","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Multi-rate switched capacitor filter design with aggressive sampling-rates: filtorX in action","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/230314/","isConference":true,"volume":"3","publicationDate":"1992","accessionNumber":"4407468","conferenceDate":"10-13 May 1992","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-13 May 1992","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multi-rate switched capacitor filter design with aggressive sampling-rates: filtorX in action","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00230314.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.031433S","chronDate":"10-13 May 1992","isNumber":"5937","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"640","citationCount":"1","articleId":"230314","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":230315,"authors":[{"name":"P.J.

An algorithm for the approximation of symbolic formulas obtained via hierarchical symbolic analysis approaches is also outlined.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-13 May 1992","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/230323/","isConference":true,"volume":"3","accessionNumber":"4407459","conferenceDate":"10-13 May 1992","publicationDate":"1992","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"On simplification techniques for symbolic analysis of analog integrated circuits","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On simplification techniques for symbolic analysis of analog integrated circuits","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00230323.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045621S","chronDate":"10-13 May 1992","isNumber":"5937","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"640","citationCount":"18","articleId":"230323","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":230324,"authors":[{"name":"P.M.

Existing methods for calculating these derivatives include the sensitivity network method, the adjoint network method, and the symbolic network function method. In recent years, several new methods have been developed for symbolic analysis of large linear networks. The new methods express the symbolic answer in the form of a sequence of expressions. The author investigates the calculation of the derivatives based on the sequence of expressions. Two methods are presented. The first method derives another sequence of expressions for each sensitivity function. The second method utilizes a 3-point formula to determine the coefficients in the bilinear function from which the sensitivity function is calculated.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.1992.230324","publicationTitle":"[Proceedings] 1992 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"[Proceedings] 1992 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel2/640/5937/00230324.pdf","startPage":"1145","endPage":"1148 vol.3","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.1992.230324","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5937","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sensitivity analysis of large linear networks using symbolic programs","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=230324","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-13 May 1992","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/230324/","displayDocTitle":"Sensitivity analysis of large linear networks using symbolic programs","volume":"3","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1992","accessionNumber":"4407458","conferenceDate":"10-13 May 1992","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sensitivity analysis of large linear networks using symbolic programs","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00230324.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.035117S","chronDate":"10-13 May 1992","isNumber":"5937","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"640","citationCount":"22","articleId":"230324","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":230345,"authors":[{"name":"H.H.

This system uses a hierarchical architecture which coupled an expert system (ES) with a set of neural networks (NNs) for assessing power system contingencies. The rule-based ES is used to examine various approximate measures to perform a preliminary coarse screening and direct the potentially harmful contingencies for further analysis by the NNs in a two-level structure. The first-level NN, called the severity evaluator, performs a finer screening by classifying the contingencies according to the severity of limit violations. The second-level NN, called the postcontingency predictor, estimates the postcontingency voltage drops and line flows. The proposed system is particularly useful for power systems which must rely on offline load flow results for voltage limit violations. A 17-bus power system model example is used to demonstrate the applicability of the system.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-13 May 1992","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/230345/","accessionNumber":"4417395","isConference":true,"volume":"4","publicationDate":"1992","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"10-13 May 1992","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Power system security assessment using a hybrid expert system/neural network architecture","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Power system security assessment using a hybrid expert system/neural network architecture","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00230345.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.038664S","chronDate":"10-13 May 1992","isNumber":"5938","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"640","citationCount":"1","articleId":"230345","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":230346,"authors":[{"name":"Y.

Diversified CORDIC schemes such as nonredundant or redundant arithmetic are examined, among which a specific scheme for a processor, utilizing full pipelining at the micro level, is assessed to produce a single-chip VLSI for 50-Mpixel/s applications under the current state-of-the-art MOS technology.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Very large scale integration","Image processing","Symmetric matrices","Computer architecture","Application software","Pixel","Digital arithmetic","Digital images","Digital TV","Image generation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["digital arithmetic","digital signal processing chips","image processing equipment","parallel architectures","pipeline processing","VLSI"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["nonredundant arithmetic","homogeneous coordinates","image processing","address mapping","VLSI architectures","geometrical mapping problems","geometric transformation","two-dimensional Cartesian coordinates","augmented CORDIC","redundant arithmetic","full pipelining","single-chip VLSI","MOS technology"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=230356","doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.1992.230356","startPage":"1668","endPage":"1671 vol.4","publicationTitle":"[Proceedings] 1992 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"[Proceedings] 1992 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel2/640/5938/00230356.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5938","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.1992.230356","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/230356/","displayDocTitle":"VLSI architectures for image processing and address mapping","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-13 May 1992","volume":"4","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1992","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4417384","conferenceDate":"10-13 May 1992","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"VLSI architectures for image processing and address mapping","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00230356.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043699S","chronDate":"10-13 May 1992","isNumber":"5938","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"640","articleId":"230356","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":230357,"authors":[{"name":"A.J.

Significant hardware reduction is achieved in three ways. First, the number of biquads is reduced by biquad-sharing such that each channel consists of three biquads in parallel, and a n-channel filter bank requires only n+2 biquads and n sum-gain amplifiers for implementation. Secondly, area-efficient SC biquads are used, and the capacitor spread of each biquad is approximately 1/ square root Omega /sub 0/T, where Omega /sub 0/ is the pole frequency and T is the sampling period. Finally, a lowpass notch biquad is used to avoid a zero at z=-1, which results in a very small capacitor in each biquad. Simulation results for a 32-channel filter bank are given to demonstrate the validity of this design.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/230371/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-13 May 1992","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"10-13 May 1992","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1992","accessionNumber":"4411843","volume":"4","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Cochlear filters design using a parallel dilating-biquads switched-capacitor filter bank","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cochlear filters design using a parallel dilating-biquads switched-capacitor filter bank","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00230371.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.030702S","chronDate":"10-13 May 1992","isNumber":"5938","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"640","citationCount":"5","articleId":"230371","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":230372,"authors":[{"name":"F.

In the low temperature limit, a legal data assignment solution is obtained, which seeks to minimize the desired objective function. The method was implemented on the two-dimensional module placement problem. For the minimum squared wire length objective, the algorithm outperformed several other methods on module placement examples from the literature.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Temperature","Digital audio players","Simulated annealing","Constraint optimization","Clustering algorithms","Wire","Law","Legal factors","Traveling salesman problems","Cities and towns"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["circuit layout CAD","modules","optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data assignment problems","module placement","constrained clustering","clustering algorithm","deterministic annealing method","low temperature limit","objective function","minimum squared wire length objective"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.1992.230430","publicationTitle":"[Proceedings] 1992 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"[Proceedings] 1992 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel2/640/5938/00230430.pdf","startPage":"1937","endPage":"1940 vol.4","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5938","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.1992.230430","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Constrained clustering for data assignment problems with examples of module placement","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=230430","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Constrained clustering for data assignment problems with examples of module placement","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/230430/","isConference":true,"volume":"4","publicationDate":"1992","accessionNumber":"4407505","conferenceDate":"10-13 May 1992","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-13 May 1992","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Constrained clustering for data assignment problems with examples of module placement","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00230430.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.027292S","chronDate":"10-13 May 1992","isNumber":"5938","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"640","citationCount":"5","articleId":"230430","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":230434,"authors":[{"name":"A.

It is shown that the overall recursion can be split into loosely coupled parts which can be computed in an interleaved way. A formal method is given to introduce various degrees of interleaving into the recursion making use of the topological equivalence of various different trellis representations. Conventional high speed Viterbi decoder architectures are coarse-grain pipelined at the ACS level. Using TPI far more efficient solutions are obtained by using fewer processing elements than states. The additional concurrency available through TPI is exploited by fine-grain pipelined architectures. The results agree with the general concept of first introducing pipelining to the maximum possible extent before introducing parallelism to achieve the most efficient solutions.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.1992.230446","publicationTitle":"[Proceedings] 1992 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"[Proceedings] 1992 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel2/640/5938/00230446.pdf","startPage":"1875","endPage":"1878 vol.4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.1992.230446","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5938","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Trellis pipeline-interleaving: a novel method for efficient Viterbi decoder implementation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=230446","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-13 May 1992","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/230446/","displayDocTitle":"Trellis pipeline-interleaving: a novel method for efficient Viterbi decoder implementation","volume":"4","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1992","accessionNumber":"4407489","conferenceDate":"10-13 May 1992","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Trellis pipeline-interleaving: a novel method for efficient Viterbi decoder implementation","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00230446.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059571S","chronDate":"10-13 May 1992","isNumber":"5938","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"640","citationCount":"8","articleId":"230446","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":230484,"authors":[{"name":"Z.

The design is based on an order recursive variant of the delayed least mean squares (DLMS) algorithm. The order recursive nature of this algorithm allows the use of pipelining techniques to design high speed adaptive filters whose sampling rates are independent of the filter order. It is shown that this algorithm can be vectorized so that an arbitrary number of outputs can be computed simultaneously using parallel hardware. The proposed system is shown to be capable of implementing transversal adaptive filters at sampling rates which are theoretically without bound. The performance of the proposed system is analyzed and simulation results are presented to verify the convergence properties of the algorithm.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.1992.230560","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.1992.230560","startPage":"2176","endPage":"2179 vol.5","displayPublicationTitle":"1992 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems (ISCAS)","pdfPath":"/iel2/640/5939/00230560.pdf","publicationTitle":"1992 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems (ISCAS)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5939","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An arbitrarily high sampling rate DLMS adaptive filter","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-13 May 1992","displayDocTitle":"An arbitrarily high sampling rate DLMS adaptive filter","conferenceDate":"10-13 May 1992","publicationDate":"1992","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isConference":true,"volume":"5","accessionNumber":"4411868","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/230560/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An arbitrarily high sampling rate DLMS adaptive filter","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00230560.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.039661S","chronDate":"10-13 May 1992","isNumber":"5939","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"640","citationCount":"2","articleId":"230560","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-20"},{"_id":230563,"authors":[{"name":"V.F.

The Sigma Delta modulator example is used to illustrate how the block diagram of a system is converted into the input file format. The means by which new functional blocks can be added to MIDAS are presented. All functional blocks in MIDAS are defined in model files, which are compiled directly into the program.

The approach uses the two step DCT algorithm of P. Duhamel and H. H'Mida (1987). The first step is a cyclic convolution. It is followed by a multiplication with a matrix filled with 0 and +or-1. This algorithm is realized in residue arithmetic. Because the residue arithmetic is carry-free and the chosen DCT algorithm allows a hardware implementation with local interconnections and great regularity, the proposed architecture for an 8*8 DCT can reach throughput rates over 150 MSamples/s, which meets the requirements for HDTV applications.

The first is a simulation kernel, whose underlying base model is a layer of units, processing inputs to outputs. The core model has no knowledge of the ANN, but serves as a base for specialized layers. The second is the interactive counterpart, where by means of several windows, the actual state of the simulation can be visualized with variable amounts of information, and controlled, interacting with the layer as a whole, or with every single variable. Every specialized layer inherits from its parent layer both the simulation kernel and its interactive counterpart, modifies existing functions, and adds new variables and functions. Individual layers are combined by multiple inheritance.

Simulation results of a switched-capacitor implementation of the oversampled compandor are presented.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5940","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.1992.230676","publicationTitle":"1992 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems (ISCAS)","displayPublicationTitle":"1992 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems (ISCAS)","pdfPath":"/iel2/640/5940/00230676.pdf","startPage":"2649","endPage":"2652 vol.6","doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.1992.230676","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Monolithic CMOS compandors based on Sigma - Delta oversampling","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-13 May 1992","displayDocTitle":"Monolithic CMOS compandors based on Sigma - Delta oversampling","isConference":true,"volume":"6","conferenceDate":"10-13 May 1992","publicationDate":"1992","accessionNumber":"4421883","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/230676/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Monolithic CMOS compandors based on Sigma - Delta oversampling","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00230676.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.017066S","chronDate":"10-13 May 1992","isNumber":"5940","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"640","citationCount":"1","articleId":"230676","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-10"},{"_id":230677,"authors":[{"name":"F.

The proposed dynamic ternary gates do not dissipate DC power and have full voltage swings. A circuit structure called the simple ternary differential logic (STDL) is also proposed and analyzed, and an optimal procedure is developed. An experimental chip has been fabricated in a 1.2- mu m CMOS process and tested. A binary pipelined multiplier has been designed, using the proposed dynamic ternary logic circuits in the interior of the multiplier for coding of radix-2 redundant positive-digit number. The structure has the advantages of higher operating frequency, less latency, and lower device count as compared with the conventional binary parallel pipelined multiplier. The advantages of the circuits over other dynamic ternary logic circuits are shown.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/4.231326","startPage":"895","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel1/4/5979/00231326.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/4.231326","endPage":"906","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5979","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design and application of pipelined dynamic CMOS ternary logic and simple ternary differential logic","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/231326/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1993","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1993","displayDocTitle":"Design and application of pipelined dynamic CMOS ternary logic and simple ternary differential logic","volume":"28","issue":"8","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4505201","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Aug. 1993","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design and application of pipelined dynamic CMOS ternary logic and simple ternary differential logic","sourcePdf":"00231326.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.091239S","chronDate":"Aug 1993","isNumber":"5979","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"39","articleId":"231326","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":231327,"authors":[{"name":"C.R.

It is similar in operation to flip-flop-based divide-by-N circuits. However, the maximum operating frequency is determined by the charge transit time between CCD electrodes, rather than the propagation delay of a logic gate in which circuit parasitics limit performance, so that relatively large gate length CCD electrodes (1 mu m) can be used in a millimeter-wave device. A prototype CCD-FP has been implemented in a GaAs-AlGaAs modulation-doped CCD (MD-CCD) technology and demonstrated at frequencies up to 18 GHz. The CCD-FP has a constant input voltage sensitivity as a function of input frequency and the output signal is phase locked to the input. Expansion of the prescaler modulus incurs no penalty in speed of operation and very modest increases in power dissipation, circuit complexity, and chip area. In conjunction with PISCES two-dimensional transient simulations of the 1- mu m MD-CCD, SPICE analysis predicts that an InGaAs-based CCD-FP is capable of operating frequencies approaching 100 GHz.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/4.231329","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel1/4/5979/00231329.pdf","startPage":"922","endPage":"930","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/4.231329","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5979","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A CCD frequency prescaler for broadband applications","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/231329/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1993","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1993","displayDocTitle":"A CCD frequency prescaler for broadband applications","volume":"28","issue":"8","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 1993","accessionNumber":"4505204","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A CCD frequency prescaler for broadband applications","sourcePdf":"00231329.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.044313S","chronDate":"Aug 1993","isNumber":"5979","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"4","articleId":"231329","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":231336,"authors":[{"name":"H.A.

Hasegawa and the experiments of L.F. Mollenauer on long distance soliton propagation for use in repeaterless transoceanic fiber transmission cables are described. In 1986, limitations on the distance that can be spanned by a repeaterless link for a given bit rate were shown to exist. It has been shown recently that by proper design these limitations can be overcome, so that newer transoceanic cable designs are likely to utilize solitons. The special properties of solitons make them particularly suited for all optical switching and logic operations. Some recent experiments with such switches are described.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/231336/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  1993","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"July  1993","volume":"81","issue":"7","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"July 1993","accessionNumber":"4502582","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","displayDocTitle":"Optical fiber solitons, their properties and uses","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optical fiber solitons, their properties and uses","sourcePdf":"00231336.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.074661S","chronDate":"July  1993","isNumber":"5980","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"46","articleId":"231336","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":231338,"authors":[{"name":"M.

The quasi-integrated antenna used in the receiver has a high gain, a high Gaussian coupling efficiency and a wide bandwidth. The mixer design consists of a planar GaAs Schottky diode placed at the feed of a dipole probe suspended inside an integrated horn antenna. The diode uses an etched surface channel and a planar air bridge for reduced parasitic capacitance. At 92 GHz, the room temperature antenna-mixer exhibits a double sideband (DBS) conversion loss and noise temperature of 5.5+or-0.5 Db and 770 K+or-50 K, respectively.

While this is not a disadvantage for CW or narrowband irradiation, the results thus obtained may be highly erroneous for short pulses where ultrawide bandwidths are involved. In some recent publications, procedures based on a convolution integral describing D(t) in terms of E(t) are given for media for which the complex permittivity in *( omega ) may be described by a single-order Debye relaxation equation or a modified version thereof. Procedures are, however, needed for general dispersive media for which in *( omega ) and mu *( omega ) may be expressible in terms of rational functions, or for human tissues for which multiterm Debye relaxation equations must generally be used. The authors describe a new differential equation approach, which can be used for general dispersive media.

The quasioptical RTD oscillator is well suited as a local oscillator for low-power radiometric mixers.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/22.231671","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5990","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel1/22/5990/00231671.pdf","endPage":"722","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A quasioptical resonant-tunneling-diode oscillator operating above 200 GHz","doi":"10.1109/22.231671","startPage":"720","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=231671","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1993","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1993","displayDocTitle":"A quasioptical resonant-tunneling-diode oscillator operating above 200 GHz","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/231671/","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4500551","publicationDate":"April 1993","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"41","issue":"4","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A quasioptical resonant-tunneling-diode oscillator operating above 200 GHz","sourcePdf":"00231671.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.038365S","chronDate":"Apr 1993","isNumber":"5990","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"5","articleId":"231671","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":231672,"authors":[{"name":"G.G.

The method presented here attempts to take advantage of the speed of gradient-based methods and of the efficient pseudorandom searching abilities of tree annealing. The result is a technique which behaves as a directed multistart gradient method. All minima encountered during optimization are recorded, thus providing alternatives in case of a nonphysical final solution.

Each of these channels corrupts the transmitted signal by a mixture of additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) and frequency-nonselective, correlated, fast Rician fading. By analysis it is shown that for the lth (1<or=l<or= Lambda ) diversity channel, the basic hardware structure of the optimal receiver consists of a combination of envelope, multiple differential, and coherent detectors. In order to reduce the overall implementation complexity, suboptimal, e.g., having a small number of differential detectors and equal combining diversity structures, versions of the optimal receivers are proposed and evaluated. Two modulation schemes are chosen in order to evaluate the overall performance of the proposed reduced-complexity diversity receivers: the pi /4-shift 8-DQAM (differential quadrature amplitude modulation) and the 8-DPSK (differential phase shift keying). Bit-error-rate (BER) performance evaluation results are given. By means of computer simulation, the effect of correlation between the fading processes on the Lambda diversity channels is investigated.<<ETX>>","doi":"10.1109/25.231875","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel1/25/5992/00231875.pdf","startPage":"245","endPage":"258","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/25.231875","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5992","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal detection of coded differentially encoded QAM and PSK signals with diversity reception in correlated fast Rician fading channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=231875","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1993","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1993","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/231875/","displayDocTitle":"Optimal detection of coded differentially encoded QAM and PSK signals with diversity reception in correlated fast Rician fading channels","volume":"42","issue":"3","publicationDate":"Aug. 1993","accessionNumber":"4531171","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal detection of coded differentially encoded QAM and PSK signals with diversity reception in correlated fast Rician fading channels","sourcePdf":"00231875.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.069034S","chronDate":"Aug 1993","isNumber":"5992","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"18","articleId":"231875","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":231876,"authors":[{"name":"C.S.

Computer simulation and laboratory experiments confirm that the proposed diversity scheme achieves a performance very close to that of ideal maximal ratio combining.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel1/25/5992/00231881.pdf","startPage":"294","endPage":"301","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","doi":"10.1109/25.231881","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/25.231881","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5992","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=231881","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance of multi-level QAM with post-detection maximal ratio combining space diversity for digital land-mobile radio communications","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Diversity reception","Quadrature amplitude modulation","Diversity methods","Rayleigh channels","Interchannel interference","Space technology","Fading","Computer simulation","Laboratories","Receivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["amplitude modulation","digital radio systems","diversity reception","mobile radio systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["16 QAM","64 QAM","256 QAM","digital land-mobile radio communications","post-detection maximal ratio combining","space diversity receivers","multilevel quadrature amplitude modulation","QAM","pilot-symbol-aided fading estimator","digital signal processing"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/231881/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1993","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1993","displayDocTitle":"Performance of multi-level QAM with post-detection maximal ratio combining space diversity for digital land-mobile radio communications","volume":"42","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 1993","accessionNumber":"4531177","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance of multi-level QAM with post-detection maximal ratio combining space diversity for digital land-mobile radio communications","sourcePdf":"00231881.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.034404S","chronDate":"Aug 1993","isNumber":"5992","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"50","articleId":"231881","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":231882,"authors":[{"name":"W.D.

The scheme encodes synchronization information in parallel with data in the same manner in which data is encoded in the OFDM/FM frame. The synchronization information is in the form of tones, centered in certain reserved frequency subchannels of the OFDM signal. The receiver uses a correlation detector, implemented in the frequency domain, to acquire synchronization accurately on a packet-by-packet basis. Experimental results indicate that the bit-error-rate performance achievable with the proposed scheme is within 1.5 dB of the performance obtained with ideal synchronization.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel1/25/5992/00231882.pdf","startPage":"302","endPage":"313","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","doi":"10.1109/25.231882","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/25.231882","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5992","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=231882","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"OFDM/FM frame synchronization for mobile radio data communication","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Land mobile radio","Data communication","Frequency synchronization","Frequency modulation","Digital communication","OFDM modulation","Frequency division multiplexing","Receivers","Detectors","Frequency domain analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data communication systems","digital radio systems","fading","frequency division multiplexing","mobile radio systems","synchronisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["BER","VHF","UHF","fading","frame synchronization","mobile radio data communication","synchronization scheme","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","pure ALOHA environment","OFDM/FM frame","reserved frequency subchannels","correlation detector","frequency domain","packet-by-packet basis","bit-error-rate performance"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/231882/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1993","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1993","displayDocTitle":"OFDM/FM frame synchronization for mobile radio data communication","volume":"42","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 1993","accessionNumber":"4531178","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"OFDM/FM frame synchronization for mobile radio data communication","sourcePdf":"00231882.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.033322S","chronDate":"Aug 1993","isNumber":"5992","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"96","articleId":"231882","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":231883,"authors":[{"name":"G.

Comparison on the basis of average power puts TCM 16-QAM 5-dB ahead of TCM 8-PSK (phase-shift keying). Even comparison on the basis of peak power gives TCM 16-QAM a 2.44-dB advantage over TCM 8-PSK.

A theoretical analysis of a postdetection optimal diversity combiner that can minimize the symbol error probability for differential phase shift keying (DPSK) differential detection in the presence of multiplicative Rayleigh fading, and co-channel interference (CCI) is presented. The effect of unequal average powers among diversity branches is taken into account. It is shown that the postdetection maximal-ratio combiner (MRC) described previously by the author is not optimal unless all branches have the same average power. It is also found that the combiner optimized for the effect of CCI (fading induced random FM noise) should weight each branch detector output in inverse proportion to the average CCI power (desired signal power). Assuming two-branch diversity, calculated BER (bit-error-rate) performance of pi /4-shift QDPSK due to AWGN, CCI, and random FM is presented. In addition, the BER due to multipath channel delay spread (which is not treated in the theoretical analysis) is also computed to find the optimal combiner.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/25.231885","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel1/25/5992/00231885.pdf","startPage":"326","endPage":"337","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/25.231885","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5992","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Postdetection optimal diversity combiner for DPSK differential detection","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=231885","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1993","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1993","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/231885/","displayDocTitle":"Postdetection optimal diversity combiner for DPSK differential detection","volume":"42","issue":"3","publicationDate":"Aug. 1993","accessionNumber":"4531181","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Postdetection optimal diversity combiner for DPSK differential detection","sourcePdf":"00231885.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.039161S","chronDate":"Aug 1993","isNumber":"5992","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"29","articleId":"231885","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":231886,"authors":[{"name":"U.

Channel fading simulation based on the model is generally chosen for flexible validation, testing, and comparison of new designs. To simulate the time- and frequency-selective behavior of macrocell mobile radio channels, a method is presented, which is based on a physical model for the radiowave propagation process in these environments. The approach enables a generation of complex impulse responses as given by the statistics of the underlying channel behavior. Delay profiles and fading characteristics of the multipath structures can be efficiently simulated by reproducing the physical wave interference process, thereby incorporating the different channel characteristics that are observed in different environments, such as urban or suburban areas.

The theoretical equivalence of all the considered multiple-access schemes is found. In a fading multipath environment, which is typical for mobile radio applications, there are significant differences between these multiple-access schemes.

Simulations demonstrate that simple interpolators give excellent performance. In many cases, two-point, linear interpolation is adequate. If better performance is needed, classical four-point, third-order polynomials could be used. Better yet, a novel four-point interpolating filter with piecewise-parabolic impulse response can have performance superior to that of the standard cubic interpolator and still be implemented much more simply.

A routing technique called least-resistance routing (LRR) is developed, and various versions of this routing method are examined. LRR uses a quantitative assessment of the interference environment experienced by a radio's receiver to determine a resistance value for that radio. Two components for the interference environment are considered: transmissions from other radios and partial-band jamming. The resistances for each of the radios in a particular path are combined to form the path resistance, and packets are forwarded on the path with the smallest resistance. Comparisons are made between different versions of LRR and between LRR and previously developed adaptive routing techniques. It is found that LRR is an effective way for dealing with mobile jamming in a frequency-hop packet radio network. Significant increases in throughput and end-to-end probability of success are obtained with LRR.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/26.231943","startPage":"1117","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel1/26/5994/00231943.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/26.231943","endPage":"1124","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5994","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Routing in frequency-hop packet radio networks with partial-band jamming","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/231943/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul 1993","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul 1993","displayDocTitle":"Routing in frequency-hop packet radio networks with partial-band jamming","volume":"41","issue":"7","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4520841","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"July 1993","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Routing in frequency-hop packet radio networks with partial-band jamming","sourcePdf":"00231943.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.037192S","chronDate":"Jul 1993","isNumber":"5994","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"48","articleId":"231943","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":231960,"authors":[{"name":"S.

Two novel circuit design schemes have been proposed: scarce state transition (SST) decoding and direct high-coding-rate convolutional code generation and variable-rate decoding. SST makes it possible to omit the final decision circuit and to reduce the required path memory length without degrading error probability performance. Moreover, the power consumption of the SST Viterbi decoder is significantly reduced when implemented as a CMOS device. These features overcome the speed limits of high-speed and high-coding-gain Viterbi decoder VLSIs in the rate one-half mode imposed by the thermal limitation. The other Viterbi decoding scheme makes it possible to realize a simple and variable coding-rate forward-error-correction circuit by changing only the branch metric calculation ROM tables.

As the largest application to date of the UNITY methodology, the derivation illustrates a number of techniques for organizing large specifications and proofs.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/32.232015","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/32.232015","startPage":"503","endPage":"528","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel1/32/5997/00232015.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5997","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Formal derivation of concurrent programs: an example from industry","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1993","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1993","displayDocTitle":"Formal derivation of concurrent programs: an example from industry","publicationDate":"May 1993","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","volume":"19","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4500742","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/232015/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Formal derivation of concurrent programs: an example from industry","sourcePdf":"00232015.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.031641S","chronDate":"May 1993","isNumber":"5997","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"32","citationCount":"11","articleId":"232015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":232058,"authors":[{"name":"C.C.

Multiple layers of Au and In are deposited on semiconductor wafers in one vacuum cycle to reduce In oxidation. The semiconductor dice are then bonded to substrates coated with Au. Above 157 degrees C, the indium layer melts and dissolves the Au layers to form a mixture of liquid and solid. The solid-liquid interdiffusion process continues until the mixture solidifies to form the Au-In bond. A scanning acoustic microscope (SAM) was used to determine the excellent bonding quality before and after thermal shock tests while an energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) was employed to determine the composition of the resulting bonds. The resulting bond has an unbonding temperature greater than 545 degrees C. Due to the low process temperature, the stress on the bonded structure caused by thermal expansion mismatch is reduced. This type of bonding is useful when bonding at a low temperature is followed by a subsequent higher temperature process.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6000","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Components, Hybrids, and Manufacturing Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Components, Hybrids, and Manufacturing Technology","pdfPath":"/iel1/33/6000/00232058.pdf","doi":"10.1109/33.232058","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/33.232058","startPage":"311","endPage":"316","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Au-In bonding below the eutectic temperature","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1993","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1993","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/232058/","displayDocTitle":"Au-In bonding below the eutectic temperature","isJournal":true,"volume":"16","issue":"3","accessionNumber":"4505403","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"May 1993","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Au-In bonding below the eutectic temperature","sourcePdf":"00232058.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.103121S","chronDate":"May 1993","isNumber":"6000","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"33","citationCount":"100","articleId":"232058","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":232061,"authors":[{"name":"K.K.

Thus, this distance can be used to determine the degree of resemblance between two objects that are superimposed on one another. Efficient algorithms for computing the Hausdorff distance between all possible relative positions of a binary image and a model are presented. The focus is primarily on the case in which the model is only allowed to translate with respect to the image. The techniques are extended to rigid motion. The Hausdorff distance computation differs from many other shape comparison methods in that no correspondence between the model and the image is derived. The method is quite tolerant of small position errors such as those that occur with edge detectors and other feature extraction methods. It is shown that the method extends naturally to the problem of comparing a portion of a model against an image.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/232073/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1993","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1993","volume":"15","issue":"9","accessionNumber":"4526016","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Sept. 1993","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Comparing images using the Hausdorff distance","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Comparing images using the Hausdorff distance","sourcePdf":"00232073.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.029622S","chronDate":"Sep 1993","isNumber":"6001","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"2466","articleId":"232073","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":232084,"authors":[{"name":"N.P.

It is shown experimentally that the scheme gives good performance.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/41.232215","startPage":"355","endPage":"363","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel1/41/6004/00232215.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/41.232215","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6004","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A fully software-controlled PWM rectifier with current link","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Pulse width modulation","Rectifiers","Space vector pulse width modulation","Reactive power","Microcomputers","Microprocessors","Circuits","Filters","Voltage","Hardware"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["digital control","microcomputer applications","pulse width modulation","rectifiers","voltage control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["voltage control","digital control","software","PWM rectifier","current link","switches","three-phase","load","power factor","input filter","space vector modulation","hardware","microcomputer","16 bit"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/232215/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1993","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1993","displayDocTitle":"A fully software-controlled PWM rectifier with current link","volume":"40","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"June 1993","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4514916","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A fully software-controlled PWM rectifier with current link","sourcePdf":"00232215.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.03568S","chronDate":"Jun 1993","isNumber":"6004","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"59","articleId":"232215","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":232234,"authors":[{"name":"P.P.

Static EIT image reconstruction requires a large amount of computation. In order to overcome the limitations on reducing the computation time by algorithmic approaches, the improved Newton-Raphson algorithm was implemented on a parallel computer system.

The procedure detects structures in a head data volume in a hierarchical fashion. Automatic detection starts with a histogram-based thresholding step, whenever necessary preceded by an image intensity correction procedure. This step is followed by a morphological procedure which refines the binary threshold mask images. Anatomical knowledge, essential for the discrimination between desired and undesired structures, is implemented in this step through a sequence of conventional and novel morphological operations, using 2-D and 3-D operations. A final step of the procedure performs overlap tests on candidate brain regions of interest in neighboring slice images to propagate coherent 2-D brain masks through the third dimension. Results are presented for test runs of the procedure on 23 coronal whole-brain data sets, and one sagittal whole-brain data set. Finally, the potential of the technique for generalization to other problems is discussed, as well as limitations of the technique.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"June  1993","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/232244/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  1993","volume":"12","issue":"2","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"June 1993","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4520207","pubMedId":"18218403","displayDocTitle":"Automatic detection of brain contours in MRI data sets","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Automatic detection of brain contours in MRI data sets","sourcePdf":"00232244.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.042865S","chronDate":"June  1993","isNumber":"6006","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"42","citationCount":"181","articleId":"232244","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":232249,"authors":[{"name":"L.

It is a spatial-domain multiview approach which makes use of the moment method to discretize the integral-equation formulation of inverse scattering. A pseudoinversion technique is applied to obtain a minimum-norm solution for the equivalent current density inside the cross-section of a scatterer. A multi-illumination-angle multiview process is used. The invariance of the Green matrix makes it possible to perform only one pseudoinverse (off line and once for all), independently of the number of views, thus reducing the need for computer resources. A pixel representation is adopted, and a look-up table is utilized to fast synthesize images. No plane-wave illumination is required and no first-order approximations are applied. Distortions in the dielectric reconstruction and noise effects are evaluated via some numerical simulations.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reconstruction of dielectric permittivity distributions in arbitrary 2-D inhomogeneous biological bodies by a multiview microwave numerical method","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","doi":"10.1109/42.232251","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","pdfPath":"/iel1/42/6006/00232251.pdf","startPage":"232","endPage":"239","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/42.232251","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6006","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=232251","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/232251/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"June  1993","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  1993","displayDocTitle":"Reconstruction of dielectric permittivity distributions in arbitrary 2-D inhomogeneous biological bodies by a multiview microwave numerical method","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"12","issue":"2","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"June 1993","accessionNumber":"4520214","pubMedId":"18218410","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reconstruction of dielectric permittivity distributions in arbitrary 2-D inhomogeneous biological bodies by a multiview microwave numerical method","sourcePdf":"00232251.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.054748S","chronDate":"June  1993","isNumber":"6006","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"42","citationCount":"37","articleId":"232251","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":232258,"authors":[{"name":"M.

By reconstructing in one single slice all lines of response defined by two adjacent rings of detectors, a fourfold increase in the number of coincidence lines is obtained and a uniform sampling distance equal to one-quarter the interdetector spacing is achieved. Whereas this is obtained at the expense of a 100% degradation of the resolution in the axial direction, with the recent breed of PET (positron emission tomography) scanners using nearly square cross section detectors, the resolution loss may be tolerable in many situations. In addition, normal reconstruction of the individual coincidence planes is always possible.

This was accomplished by using an adaptive tracking algorithm in a three-stage recursive procedure. First, given a starting position and direction, a segment in the vascular network was identified. Second, by filling it with the surrounding background pixel values, the detected segment was deleted from the angiogram. The detection-deletion scheme was employed to prevent the problem of tracking-path reentry in those areas where vessels overlap. Third, all branch points were detected by use of matched filtering along both edges of the vessel. The detected branch points were used as the starting points in the next recursion. The recursive procedure terminated when no new branch point was found. The algorithm showed a good performance when it was applied to angiograms of coronary and radial arteries. To provide a quantitative evaluation, vascular networks identified by the algorithm were compared to those identified by a human. The algorithm made some false-negative errors, but very few false-positive errors.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/42.232264","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","pdfPath":"/iel1/42/6006/00232264.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/42.232264","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6006","startPage":"334","endPage":"341","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Recursive tracking of vascular networks in angiograms based on the detection-deletion scheme","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=232264","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Recursive tracking of vascular networks in angiograms based on the detection-deletion scheme","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  1993","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/232264/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"June  1993","isJournal":true,"volume":"12","issue":"2","publicationDate":"June 1993","accessionNumber":"4520227","pubMedId":"18218423","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Recursive tracking of vascular networks in angiograms based on the detection-deletion scheme","sourcePdf":"00232264.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.029709S","chronDate":"June  1993","isNumber":"6006","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"42","citationCount":"121","articleId":"232264","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-16"},{"_id":232267,"authors":[{"name":"M.

The major intensity inhomogeneity in MRI is caused by variations in the B1-field of the radio frequency (RF) coil. A three-step method was developed to model and then reduce the effect. Using a least squares formulation, the inhomogeneity is modeled as a maximum variation order two polynomial. In the log domain the polynomial model is subtracted from the actual patient data set resulting in a compensated data set. The compensated data set is exponentiated and rescaled. Statistical comparisons indicate volumes of significant corruption undergo a large reduction in the inhomogeneity, whereas volumes of minimal corruption are not significantly changed. Acting as a preprocessor, the proposed technique can enhance the role of statistical segmentation algorithms in body MRI data sets.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/42.232267","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","pdfPath":"/iel1/42/6006/00232267.pdf","startPage":"361","endPage":"365","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6006","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/42.232267","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  1993","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"June  1993","displayDocTitle":"Polynomial modeling and reduction of RF body coil spatial inhomogeneity in MRI","volume":"12","issue":"2","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"June 1993","accessionNumber":"4520230","pubMedId":"18218426","isJournal":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/232267/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Polynomial modeling and reduction of RF body coil spatial inhomogeneity in MRI","sourcePdf":"00232267.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.027975S","chronDate":"June  1993","isNumber":"6006","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"42","citationCount":"101","articleId":"232267","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2022-01-15"},{"_id":232291,"authors":[{"name":"M.J.

Simulation-based network models which have been developed for performance evaluation of these competing access techniques are then outlined. These models are exercised with example integrated voice/data traffic models to obtain comparative system performance measures such as channel utilization, voice blocking probability, and data delay. Operating points based on typical performance constraints such as voice blocking probability 0.01 (for TDMA), voice packet loss rate 10/sup -3/ (for CDMA), and data delay 250 ms are obtained, and results are presented.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/49.232296","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel1/49/6008/00232296.pdf","startPage":"870","endPage":"884","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/49.232296","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6008","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Packet CDMA versus dynamic TDMA for multiple access in an integrated voice/data PCN","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=232296","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1993","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1993","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/232296/","displayDocTitle":"Packet CDMA versus dynamic TDMA for multiple access in an integrated voice/data PCN","volume":"11","issue":"6","publicationDate":"Aug. 1993","accessionNumber":"4500206","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Packet CDMA versus dynamic TDMA for multiple access in an integrated voice/data PCN","sourcePdf":"00232296.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.034494S","chronDate":"Aug 1993","isNumber":"6008","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"125","articleId":"232296","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":232297,"authors":[{"name":"Chih-Lin I","affiliation":["AT and T Bell Laboratories, Inc., Holmdel, NJ, USA"],"lastName":"Chih-Lin I","id":"38273658800"},{"name":"L.J.

The latter are served by microcells which are embedded within macrocells that serve the mobile users. This provides a balance between maximizing the number of users per unit area (which favors small cells) and minimizing the network control associated with handoff (which favors large cells). Four approaches to sharing the spectrum between the two tiers, using per-cell capacity as the measure, are evaluated. The first two feature spread-spectrum sharing, i.e., they use TDMA (time-division multiple access) among microcell users and CDMA (code-division multiple access) among macrocell users (System I), or vice versa (System II). The other two approaches feature orthogonal sharing, i.e., they use TDMA in both tiers, with time slots (System III) or frequency channels (System IV) partitioned so there is no overlap between tiers. Analysis shows that the capacity tradeoffs are poor for Systems I and II because of the large amounts of cross-tier interference: and that System IV gives the best capacity tradeoffs.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/49.232297","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","startPage":"885","endPage":"891","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel1/49/6008/00232297.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/49.232297","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6008","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A microcell/macrocell cellular architecture for low- and high-mobility wireless users","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Microcell networks","Macrocell networks","Personal communication networks","Time division multiple access","Multiaccess communication","Wireless networks","Communication system control","Spread spectrum communication","Frequency","Interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","code division multiple access","personal communication networks","time division multiple access"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular architecture","wireless network","PCN","personal communications network","microcells","macrocells","network control","per-cell capacity","spread-spectrum sharing","TDMA","time-division multiple access","CDMA","code-division multiple access","interference","capacity tradeoffs"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1993","displayDocTitle":"A microcell/macrocell cellular architecture for low- and high-mobility wireless users","volume":"11","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4500207","publicationDate":"Aug. 1993","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1993","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/232297/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A microcell/macrocell cellular architecture for low- and high-mobility wireless users","sourcePdf":"00232297.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.03062S","chronDate":"Aug 1993","isNumber":"6008","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"134","articleId":"232297","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":232298,"authors":[{"name":"A.M.

Delayed calls are assumed to be stored in a finite storage buffer. One scheme (Scheme I) exclusively allows handoff calls to be stored and to use a fixed number of guard channels. The other two schemes without guard channels (Scheme II-using the last-in/first-out policy for OC's and Scheme III-using the first-in first-out policy for OC's) allow both types of calls to be stored, and allow prioritized handoff calls to pushout originating calls if the buffer is full. For these three schemes, the blocking probabilities and delay distributions of both types of calls are numerically obtained, and a boundary for call handling schemes between with and without guard channels is found. From the numerical results, it is shown that Scheme II can be considered a good candidate for a call handling scheme for microcellular systems.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/49.232300","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel1/49/6008/00232300.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/49.232300","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6008","startPage":"911","endPage":"917","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance of personal portable radio telephone systems with and without guard channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=232300","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Performance of personal portable radio telephone systems with and without guard channels","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1993","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/232300/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1993","isJournal":true,"volume":"11","issue":"6","publicationDate":"Aug. 1993","accessionNumber":"4500210","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance of personal portable radio telephone systems with and without guard channels","sourcePdf":"00232300.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.035175S","chronDate":"Aug 1993","isNumber":"6008","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"132","articleId":"232300","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":232301,"authors":[{"name":"W.-C.

Call characteristics, mobility, and channel conditions have an impact on PRMA performance which is measured in terms of the average packet dropping rate per call. In order to maintain a reasonable level of service quality for calls in progress, teletraffic loading can be controlled by introducing a call setup queue and limiting the number of active subscribers. Call mobility is found to have a minor impact on PRMA performance. PRMA is also fairly robust against adverse channel conditions with a drop in performance of about 15% when the channel packet loss rate is less than 0.01.

Blocking probabilities with these arrangements are derived, and the dynamic sharing with bias (DSB) rule is suggested for increasing the trunking efficiency. A simple handoff model is formulated and analyzed for comparing the probabilities of additional handoffs due to sectoring and overlaying of cells. With the nominal allocation of 60 channels per cell and a donor cell having a load of 30 Erlangs, numerical results show that at a blocking requirement of 1%, the traffic load in the hot-spot cell can be increased from 47 to 63 Erlangs with the use of the channel borrowing with the cell sectoring scheme: while with the use of the DSB rule, the load can be increased further to 71 Erlangs.

These algorithms are applied to the extraction from skin tumor images of various features such as tumor border, crust, hair scale, shiny areas, and ulcer.

A cumulative loss function that expresses the loss evoked by imprecise learning is introduced, allowing the mathematical formalism used in the theory of tolerances and sensitivity to be applied. Learning is expressed as the problem of maximization of the volume of the area in the configuration space where the neural network exhibits small values of the cumulative loss function.

This is achieved by combining a generalization of previous results on CNN design with a design centering algorithm based on linear programming. The design process is highly efficient with small numbers of cells, and it can be precisely and flexible controlled. Many kinds of implementation-related constraints may be introduced, including bounded parameters and arbitrary topological restrictions. A nonrigorous but effective practical guideline for shaping the basins of attraction of stable outputs is recommended.

To achieve this device, low-resistance meander conductors located in a single plane were interwoven with multilevel meander magnetic cores. This 'wrapped' solenoid (with the core wrapped around the conductor) was fabricated in a fully integrated fashion. A magnetic microactuator was realized by incorporating a surface micromachined nickel-iron cantilever beam as part of the magnetic circuit of the core. The nickel-iron cantilever beam was 2.5 mu m thick, 25 mu m wide, and 780 mu m long, and the magnetic circuit contained seventeen turns of meander-type solenoid coils. Cantilever beam tip deflection of 6 mu m in the vertical direction was achieved when a DC voltage less than 1 V (and resulting drive current of 800 mA) was applied to the coils. This fully integrated multilevel topology offers advantages in a variety of micromagnetic applications, where actuators can be fabricated on the same substrate with an integrated circuit and actuated with low voltages.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6017","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/84.232590","publicationTitle":"Journal of Microelectromechanical Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Microelectromechanical Systems","pdfPath":"/iel4/84/6017/00232590.pdf","startPage":"15","endPage":"22","doi":"10.1109/84.232590","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A fully integrated surface micromachined magnetic microactuator with a multilevel meander magnetic core","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1993","displayDocTitle":"A fully integrated surface micromachined magnetic microactuator with a multilevel meander magnetic core","volume":"2","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 1993","accessionNumber":"4507408","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/232590/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1993","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A fully integrated surface micromachined magnetic microactuator with a multilevel meander magnetic core","sourcePdf":"00232590.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.034036S","chronDate":"Mar 1993","isNumber":"6017","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"84","citationCount":"70","articleId":"232590","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":232593,"authors":[{"name":"C.H.

Integrated actuators with predominantly vertical sidewall (PVS) aluminum electrodes are used to move the structures. Silicon nitride is used as an etch mask, structural stiffener, and electrical insulator. An x-y stage with integrated actuators produces controllable x-y displacements of +or-1.8 mu m when a voltage of 54.5 V is applied to either or both of the x and y actuators.

The first concerns the resultant residual gas pressure within a sealed cavity between two bonded wafers after bonding and a high-temperature anneal. The second concerns the prediction of plastic deformation in capping layers of single-crystal silicon over sealed cavities. Exposure of sealed cavity structures to a high-temperature environment causes the trapped residual gas to expand, which can result in the plastic deformation of the capping layer. A model for analytically predicting the occurrence of plastic deformatio in these silicon capping layers has been developed. The third fabrication issue concerns the prediction of the resultant height of plastically deformed capping layers of silicon after cooling. A model which gives a lower and an upper bound on the height, based on an analytical spherical shell membrane stress equation, has been developed.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/232603/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1993","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1993","volume":"2","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"June 1993","accessionNumber":"4517172","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","displayDocTitle":"Design of sealed cavity microstructures formed by silicon wafer bonding","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design of sealed cavity microstructures formed by silicon wafer bonding","sourcePdf":"00232603.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.062822S","chronDate":"Jun 1993","isNumber":"6018","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"84","citationCount":"54","articleId":"232603","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":232605,"authors":[{"name":"A.B.

The final decision is made by choosing the one with the minimal average distance score. If one views the distortion sequence as a form of observed features, a decision rule based on a specific discriminant function designed for the distortion sequence obviously will perform better than that based on the simple average distortion. The authors therefore, suggest a linear discriminant function of the form triangle = Sigma /sub (i1)/T w(i)* d(i) to compute the distance score triangle instead of a direct average triangle =1/T Sigma /sub (i1)/T d(i). Several adaptive algorithms are proposed to learn the discriminant weighting function. These include one heuristic method, two methods based on the error propagation algorithm, and one method based on the generalized probabilistic descent algorithm (GPD). They study these methods in a speaker-independent speech recognition task involving utterances of the highly confusible English E-set (b,c,d,e,g,p,t,v,z). The results show that the best performance is obtained by using the GPD-method which achieved a 78.1% accuracy, compared to 67.6% with the traditional unweighted average method.

The models, built from combinations of acoustically based sub-word units called fenones, are derived automatically from one or more sample utterances of a word. Because they are more flexible than previously reported fenone-based word models, they lead to an improved capability of modeling variations in pronunciation. They are therefore particularly useful in the recognition of continuous speech. In addition, their construction is relatively simple, because it can be done using the well-known forward-backward algorithm for parameter estimation of hidden Markov models. Appropriate reestimation formulas are derived for this purpose. Experimental results obtained on a 5000-word vocabulary natural language continuous speech recognition task are presented to illustrate the enhanced power of discrimination of the new models.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/89.232617","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Speech and Audio Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Speech and Audio Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/89/6019/00232617.pdf","startPage":"334","endPage":"344","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/89.232617","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6019","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multonic Markov word models for large vocabulary continuous speech recognition","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=232617","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul 1993","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul 1993","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/232617/","displayDocTitle":"Multonic Markov word models for large vocabulary continuous speech recognition","volume":"1","issue":"3","publicationDate":"July 1993","accessionNumber":"4533434","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multonic Markov word models for large vocabulary continuous speech recognition","sourcePdf":"00232617.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.047626S","chronDate":"Jul 1993","isNumber":"6019","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"89","citationCount":"6","articleId":"232617","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-28"},{"_id":232618,"authors":[{"name":"Y.

A bottom-up merging algorithm is developed for estimating the parameters of the mixture Gaussian densities, where the resultant number of mixture components is proportional to both the sample size and dispersion of training data. A compression procedure is developed to construct a word transcription dictionary from the acoustic-phonetic labels of sentence utterances. A modified word-pair grammar using context-sensitive grammatical parts is incorporated to constrain task difficulty. The Viterbi beam search is used for decoding. The segmental K-means algorithm is implemented as a baseline for evaluating the bottom-up merging technique. The system has been evaluated on the TIMIT database (1990) for a vocabulary size of 853. For test set perplexities of 24, 104, and 853, the decoding word accuracies are 90.9%, 86.0%, and 62.9%, respectively. For the perplexity of 104, the decoding accuracy achieved by using the merging algorithm is 4.1% higher than that using the segmental K-means (22.8% error reduction), and the decoding accuracy using the compressed dictionary is 3.0% higher than that using a standard dictionary (18.1% error reduction).<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/232618/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul 1993","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul 1993","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"July 1993","accessionNumber":"4533435","isJournal":true,"volume":"1","issue":"3","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A speaker-independent continuous speech recognition system using continuous mixture Gaussian density HMM of phoneme-sized units","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A speaker-independent continuous speech recognition system using continuous mixture Gaussian density HMM of phoneme-sized units","sourcePdf":"00232618.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.040332S","chronDate":"Jul 1993","isNumber":"6019","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"89","citationCount":"30","articleId":"232618","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":232636,"authors":[{"name":"R.

The method combines Verlet neighbor lists with coarse-grained cells. Each processing node is associated with a cubic volume of space and the particles it owns are those initially contained in the volume. Data structures for 'own' and 'visitor' particle coordinates are maintained in each node. Visitors are particles owned by one of the 26 neighboring cells but lying within an interaction range of a face. The Verlet neighbor list includes pointers to own-own and own-visitor interactions. To communicate, each of the 26 neighbor cells sends a corresponding block of particle coordinates using message-passing cells. The algorithms has the numerical properties of the standard serial Verlet method and is efficient for hundreds to thousands of particles per node allowing the simulation of large systems with millions of particles. Preliminary results on the new CM-5 supercomputer are described.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A parallel scalable approach to short-range molecular dynamics on the CM-5","publicationTitle":"Proceedings Scalable High Performance Computing Conference SHPCC-92.","doi":"10.1109/SHPCC.1992.232636","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings Scalable High Performance Computing Conference SHPCC-92.","pdfPath":"/iel2/408/6020/00232636.pdf","startPage":"240","endPage":"245","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SHPCC.1992.232636","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6020","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=232636","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/232636/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 Apr 1992","displayDocTitle":"A parallel scalable approach to short-range molecular dynamics on the CM-5","conferenceDate":"26-29 April 1992","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1992","accessionNumber":"4417544","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A parallel scalable approach to short-range molecular dynamics on the CM-5","confLoc":"Williamsburg, VA, USA","sourcePdf":"00232636.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061317S","chronDate":"26-29 Apr 1992","isNumber":"6020","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"408","citationCount":"4","articleId":"232636","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":232682,"authors":[{"name":"T.W.

This code can detect all unidirectional errors and requires simple parallel encoding/decoding. The information symbols can be separated from the check symbols. However, the information symbols containing all-0's and all-1's need to be transformed to two other information symbols. This allows one to reduce the number of checkbits over Berger code by 1. Since information symbols containing a power-of-two number of bits are quite common, this coding scheme should become quite popular. In this paper, a modular, economical and easily testable totally self-checking (TSC) checker design for the above code is described. The TSC concept is well-known for providing concurrent error detection of transient as well as permanent faults. The design is self-testing with at most only 2r+16 codeword tests. This means that if k is the number of information bits, the size of the codeword test is only O(log/sub 2/k). This is the first known TSC checker design for this code.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-9 April 1992","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/232743/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"4407818","conferenceDate":"7-9 April 1992","publicationDate":"1992","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A totally self-checking checker for a parallel unordered coding scheme","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A totally self-checking checker for a parallel unordered coding scheme","confLoc":"Atlantic City, NJ, USA","sourcePdf":"00232743.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.03346S","chronDate":"7-9 April 1992","isNumber":"6021","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"648","articleId":"232743","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":232744,"authors":[{"name":"K.

The dipoles and loops are sensitive to the polarizations of incident electromagnetic plane waves.

The invariance properties among the dipole and loop outputs of an arbitrary array of orthogonal loops and orthogonal dipoles are exploited to compute both the two-dimensional arrival angles and polarizations of incoming narrowband signals.

The configuration consists of dielectric layers having permittivities epsilon /sub 1/ and epsilon /sub 2/ stacked in an alternating arrangement, with epsilon /sub 2/> epsilon /sub 1/. This narrow-beam effect can be attributed to weakly attenuated leaky waves that exist on the structure. Simple asymptotic formulas for the propagation and attenuation constants are derived.

The SPT processor does not distort the direction vectors associated with wave fronts impinging on the array, but it does reverse the phase of the signal coming from a specified direction. With the aid of SPT processing, the signal cancellation due to correlation between the desired signal and interference is almost eliminated. The design of a robust SPT processor for combating the effects of mismatch between idealized array model and actual scenario arising from causes such as sensor location, amplitude, and phase errors is discussed. A detailed performance study of the SPT-LCMV beamformer shows it to be robust against direction uncertainty in the assumed look direction.

Specifically, a simple model for estimation of the complex baseband equivalent impulse response for indoor channels is explained. Using this model, the relationship between RMS delay spread and range on static indoor channels is estimated. Results show that this relationship is nonmonotonic and has a maximum at a range that depends on the building dimensions and the electrical properties of reflecting surfaces. The model is used in infinite, as well as finite, resolution modes to supplement the measurements of impulse response characteristics in different buildings using a limited resolution channel sounder. Experimental and modeling results are combined to derive conclusions that confirm the anticipated nonmonotonic relationship exists in empty buildings. Measurement results demonstrate that furniture has the effect of destroying this relationship, making RMS delay spread almost independent of range.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pdfPath":"/iel1/49/6028/00233211.pdf","startPage":"979","endPage":"990","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6028","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/49.233211","doi":"10.1109/49.233211","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=233211","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Indoor radio communication","Receivers","Intersymbol interference","Fading","Frequency","Delay estimation","Digital communication","Degradation","Taylor series","Transfer functions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fading","mobile radio systems","radiowave propagation","transient response"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["furniture effects","radio propagation","multipath characteristics","transmit/receiver ranges","indoor radio channel","model","complex baseband equivalent impulse response","RMS delay spread","static indoor channels","limited resolution channel sounder","nonmonotonic relationship","empty buildings"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1993","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/233211/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1993","displayDocTitle":"The dependence of indoor radio channel multipath characteristics of transmit/receiver ranges","accessionNumber":"4530801","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Sept. 1993","volume":"11","issue":"7","isJournal":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The dependence of indoor radio channel multipath characteristics of transmit/receiver ranges","sourcePdf":"00233211.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.041433S","chronDate":"Sep 1993","isNumber":"6028","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"42","articleId":"233211","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":233212,"authors":[{"name":"K.L.

Wave propagation in the VHF/UHF frequency range over natural and man-made terrain is strongly dependent on topography and morphography. Propagation modeling is based on a ray-optical approach.

Propagation models for rural and urban areas are presented for 2-D and 3-D ray tracing. Near-range models apply to the corresponding areas in forest and urban sites.

The database consists of both local spatial averages of signal attenuation and the short-term fluctuations about this average. The former, which is termed the local mean attenuation (LMA), is the primary focus. The database is used to obtain contours of constant LMA for two neighborhoods. It is shown that the contours have the shapes of convex diamonds. The authors propose that squares inscribed within these contours be used as the building blocks of microcellular environments. A theory is developed that explains the contours and predicts, with reasonable accuracy, the sizes of the inscribed squares. It is also shown that the prediction method can be applied without the need for measured data. The short-term fluctuation statistics of the signal attenuation are examined. They are shown to be Rayleigh-like in the non-line-of-sight regions of a microcell and Rice-like in the line-of-sight region. Possible extensions to other frequency bands and other urban environments are discussed.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A measurement-based model for predicting coverage areas of urban microcells","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","doi":"10.1109/49.233214","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel1/49/6028/00233214.pdf","startPage":"1013","endPage":"1023","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/49.233214","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6028","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=233214","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/233214/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1993","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1993","displayDocTitle":"A measurement-based model for predicting coverage areas of urban microcells","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"11","issue":"7","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Sept. 1993","accessionNumber":"4530804","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A measurement-based model for predicting coverage areas of urban microcells","sourcePdf":"00233214.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.052821S","chronDate":"Sep 1993","isNumber":"6028","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"95","articleId":"233214","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":233215,"authors":[{"name":"I.

A multipath indoor propagation environment with controlled delay spread was created to validate this approach. The system is close to the Digital European Cordless Telecommunications (DECT) standard with 1 Mb/s GMSK-modulated signals being transmitted in FDM/TDMA/TDD format and received by a differential direct-conversion receiver. The measured and simulated error probability floor is Pe approximately=5*10/sup -3/ as a consequence of delay spread that is 10% of the bit length.

In particular, the problem of compensating for the harsh multipath fading environment in systems whose transmission bandwidth is commensurate with the coherence bandwidth of the fading channel is considered. A TDMA channel characterization parameter, the slot-normalized fade rate, is introduced, and an adaptive bidirectional equalization technique, which estimates the location of a deep fade within a time slot, is proposed. The simulation results show that the carrier-to-noise ratio requirement is only 15.5 dB when this equalization technique is used. This is achieved without diversity, and with low complexity. An equivalent equalized land mobile radio channel model and the analytical solution for the optimal bit likelihood calculation for pi /4-shift quadrature differential phase-shift keying (QDPSK) modulation are also derived under certain channel conditions.

In mobile radio systems applying CDMA, multipath propagation leads to intersymbol interference (ISI) and together with time variance, to cross interference between the signals of different users regardless of whether the user codes are chosen orthogonal or not. A linear unbiased data estimation algorithm is presented that eliminates both ISI and cross interference perfectly by jointly detecting the different user signals, leading to unbiased estimates of the transmitted data symbols. By theoretical analysis and simulation, the performance of the linear unbiased data estimation algorithm is examined under the assumption that the radio channel impulse responses are known at the receiver. The price to be paid for the interference elimination are SNR degradations, which are calculated for typical mobile radio situations in urban areas. The resulting average uncoded bit error probabilities lead to the conclusion that systems applying the linear unbiased data estimation algorithm are well suited for mobile radio applications.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/49.233218","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel1/49/6028/00233218.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/49.233218","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6028","startPage":"1058","endPage":"1066","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Linear unbiased data estimation in mobile radio systems applying CDMA","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=233218","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Linear unbiased data estimation in mobile radio systems applying CDMA","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1993","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/233218/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1993","isJournal":true,"volume":"11","issue":"7","publicationDate":"Sept. 1993","accessionNumber":"4530808","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Linear unbiased data estimation in mobile radio systems applying CDMA","sourcePdf":"00233218.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.03064S","chronDate":"Sep 1993","isNumber":"6028","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"129","articleId":"233218","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":233219,"authors":[{"name":"Y.C.

The receiver first coherently demodulates and despreads the received signal to produce correlator outputs and initial data estimates. Based on these estimates, the cancellation scheme essentially creates replicas of the contributions of the CCl embedded in the correlator outputs and removes them for a second improved hard data decision. By repeating this operation over and over, a cascade of CCl cancellers is derived. Through theoretical analysis and simulation, the authors investigate the canceller's bit error rate (BER) performance in both the absence and presence of errors in the amplitude and phase estimates of each user's received signal.

The all-digital architecture incorporates a Costas loop for carrier recovery and a delay-locked loop for clock recovery. For the pseudorandom noise (PN) acquisition block, a robust energy detection scheme is proposed to reduce false PN locks over a broad range of signal-to-noise ratios. The proposed architecture is intended for use in the 902-928 MHz unlicensed spread spectrum radio band. A 100 kbs information rate and a 12.7 Mchips/second PN code rate are assumed. The IF center frequency is 12.7 MHz and the IF sampling rate is 50.8 Msamples/second, which is the Nyquist rate for the 25.4 MHz bandwidth signal. Finite wordlength effects have been simulated to optimize the architecture, thereby minimizing the chip area, and results of the finite wordlength simulations demonstrate that the chip architecture achieves a bit error rate performance within 1 dB of theory in an additive white Gaussian noise channel.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","startPage":"1096","endPage":"1107","doi":"10.1109/49.233222","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/49.233222","pdfPath":"/iel1/49/6028/00233222.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6028","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance analysis of an all-digital BPSK direct-sequence spread-spectrum IF receiver architecture","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/233222/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1993","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1993","displayDocTitle":"Performance analysis of an all-digital BPSK direct-sequence spread-spectrum IF receiver architecture","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Sept. 1993","accessionNumber":"4530812","volume":"11","issue":"7","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance analysis of an all-digital BPSK direct-sequence spread-spectrum IF receiver architecture","sourcePdf":"00233222.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.045271S","chronDate":"Sep 1993","isNumber":"6028","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"42","articleId":"233222","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":233232,"authors":[{"name":"G.R.

The network is based on dense multiwavelength technology and is scalable in terms of the number of networked users, the geographical range of coverage, and the aggregate network capacity. Of paramount importance to the achievement of scalability are the notions of wavelength reuse and wavelength translation. A distributed optical interconnect that is wavelength-selective and electronically controllable, permitting the same limited set of wavelengths to be reused among other access stations, is employed. By exercising the wavelength-selective switches, the wavelength-routed connectivity between stations can be reconfigured as needed. A multihop overlay network involving wavelength translation and self-routing fast packet switches permits full connectivity, if desired among the access stations at the individual virtual circuit level. Using just eight wavelengths, such a network could in principle interconnect a population of 100 million users over a nationwide geography with an expected delay equal to that of 12 hops.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/50.233237","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel1/50/6029/00233237.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/50.233237","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6029","startPage":"736","endPage":"753","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00233237.png","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A scalable multiwavelength multihop optical network: a proposal for research on all-optical networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=233237","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A scalable multiwavelength multihop optical network: a proposal for research on all-optical networks","chronOrPublicationDate":"May-June  1993","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/233237/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May-June  1993","isJournal":true,"volume":"11","issue":"5/6","publicationDate":"May-June 1993","accessionNumber":"4549224","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A scalable multiwavelength multihop optical network: a proposal for research on all-optical networks","sourcePdf":"00233237.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.066806S","chronDate":"May-June  1993","isNumber":"6029","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"238","articleId":"233237","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":233238,"authors":[{"name":"P.E.

However, the signal degradation at frequency converters limits the maximum size of the network. Noise due to optical frequency conversion using nearly degenerate four wave mixing in a semiconductor optical amplifier is investigated, and it is found that the crosstalk from one of the two pump lasers can impose the power penalty on the bit error rate (BER) characteristics after optical frequency conversion. Analytical expressions for BER are developed and used to evaluate the receiver sensitivity penalty caused by optical frequency conversion. On the basis of these results the optimal setting of the frequency difference between the signal and pump lasers and the power ratio of the two pump lasers are discussed. A 155-Mb/s frequency-shift keying (FSK) transmission with 1750-GHz (14 nm) optical frequency conversion has been carried out, using a novel phase noise cancellation method. The BER performance is in good agreement with the calculated results.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/233245/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May-June  1993","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May-June  1993","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"May-June 1993","accessionNumber":"4549232","volume":"11","issue":"5/6","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Noise analysis for optical frequency conversion using nearly degenerate four wave mixing in semiconductor optical amplifier","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Noise analysis for optical frequency conversion using nearly degenerate four wave mixing in semiconductor optical amplifier","sourcePdf":"00233245.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.059793S","chronDate":"May-June  1993","isNumber":"6029","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"13","articleId":"233245","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":233247,"authors":[{"name":"X.S.

They assume that each transmitter has a unique phase-encoding mask to scramble the pulses, and that the intended receiver has the complementary phase-decoding mask to unscramble the pulses. The necessary nonlinear pulse propagation equation is derived using a new and systematic approach. The authors then determine the minimum allowable pulse width and the maximum pulse width for the system. They next calculate the maximum optical power, which is limited by the fiber's self-phase modulation. This power is significantly larger than the minimum detectable optical power determined by the noise in the electrical receiver, so that in practice any distortion caused by the fiber's optical nonlinearity can be avoided. From their calculations estimates for all important optical parameters are provided. The deleterious effect of a slight relative misalignment between the encoding and decoding masks is also investigated.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel1/50/6029/00233247.pdf","startPage":"836","endPage":"846","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","doi":"10.1109/50.233247","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/50.233247","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6029","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=233247","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Limitations on peak pulse power, pulse width, and coding mask misalignment in a fiber-optic code-division multiple-access system","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Space vector pulse width modulation","Optical pulses","Optical receivers","Optical distortion","Optical transmitters","Fiber nonlinear optics","Optical noise","Optical modulation","Multiaccess communication","Optical fiber communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiple access","decoding","encoding","optical dispersion","optical fibres","optical links"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optical fibre links","peak pulse power","pulse width","coding mask misalignment","fiber-optic","code-division multiple-access","fiber dispersion","optical nonlinearity","CDMA","phase-encoding mask","phase-decoding mask","nonlinear pulse propagation equation","maximum optical power","self-phase modulation","optical parameters"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/233247/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May-June  1993","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May-June  1993","displayDocTitle":"Limitations on peak pulse power, pulse width, and coding mask misalignment in a fiber-optic code-division multiple-access system","volume":"11","issue":"5/6","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May-June 1993","accessionNumber":"4549234","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Limitations on peak pulse power, pulse width, and coding mask misalignment in a fiber-optic code-division multiple-access system","sourcePdf":"00233247.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.168088S","chronDate":"May-June  1993","isNumber":"6029","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"8","articleId":"233247","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":233249,"authors":[{"name":"M.E.

Frequency routing of a 3-Gb/s bit stream in 10-ns packets between ten different destinations has been demonstrated with this laser. The second component is a broadband wavelength shifter capable of switching multigigabit data between optical frequencies in the 1.5- mu m region.

These wavelength-dilated switches (WDSs) are reconfigurable and fault-tolerant, and they feature suppressed crosstalk and denser wavelength-spacings. They are scalable, with switch-complexity of alpha N log/sub 2/ N, where alpha is the dilation constant, typically 4.6, and N is the number of ports. It is shown, that by careful wavelength grouping, the crosstalk is reduced significantly. A switch architecture is suggested to fully exploit the advantages of this method. An example is given showing how such a fabric can be used to reduce the coherent crosstalk in wavelength-routing switches based on acoustooptic tunable filters (AOTF), making them practical for networks with subnanometer wavelength spacings. The WDS can be used in a broad range of applications from interconnection networks to wide-area networks (WANs) on a national scale. Large cross connects can support tens of thousands of channels using only few tens of wavelengths.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/50.233254","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6029","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/50.233254","endPage":"907","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel1/50/6029/00233254.pdf","startPage":"900","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The wavelength dilation concept in lightwave networks-implementation and system considerations","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May-June  1993","chronOrPublicationDate":"May-June  1993","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/233254/","displayDocTitle":"The wavelength dilation concept in lightwave networks-implementation and system considerations","volume":"11","issue":"5/6","accessionNumber":"4549241","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"May-June 1993","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The wavelength dilation concept in lightwave networks-implementation and system considerations","sourcePdf":"00233254.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.030018S","chronDate":"May-June  1993","isNumber":"6029","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"20","articleId":"233254","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":233257,"authors":[{"name":"Z.

The architecture is based on two rearrangeably nonblocking stages interconnected by optical delay lines with different amounts of delay. The probability of loss and the switch latency as a function of link utilization and of the size of the switch are investigated. In general, with proper setting of the number of delay lines, the switch can achieve an arbitrarily low probability of loss. Growability patterns and extension of the design to the dense wavelength-division-multiplexing (WDM) case are also shown. In particular, an extension to the architecture whereby, through the use of WDM, the switch capability can be increased several times, with only minor changes to the switch design is discussed. Additionally, issues involving practical implementation of such a switch are considered. For example, a scheme that allows optical packet synchronization for the synchronously-operated switch is shown. Using this scheme, the switch can be a central component in the design of future all-optical, packet-switched networks.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=233257","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optical packet switching","Optical switches","Optical control","Optical buffering","Optical fiber networks","Optical attenuators","Wavelength division multiplexing","Optical design","Stimulated emission","Delay lines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiplexing equipment","optical communication equipment","optical switches","packet switching","scheduling","switching systems","synchronisation","telecommunication traffic","telecommunications control","wavelength division multiplexing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dense WDM","loss probability","bursty traffic model","optical fibre links","output-collision resolution scheme","staggering switch","electronically controlled","optical packet switch","rearrangeably nonblocking stages","optical delay lines","switch latency","wavelength-division-multiplexing","switch capability","optical packet synchronization","synchronously-operated switch"]}],"publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel1/50/6029/00233257.pdf","startPage":"925","endPage":"936","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6029","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/50.233257","doi":"10.1109/50.233257","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The 'staggering switch': an electronically controlled optical packet switch","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"May-June  1993","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May-June  1993","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/233257/","displayDocTitle":"The 'staggering switch': an electronically controlled optical packet switch","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"May-June 1993","accessionNumber":"4549244","volume":"11","issue":"5/6","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The 'staggering switch': an electronically controlled optical packet switch","sourcePdf":"00233257.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.045086S","chronDate":"May-June  1993","isNumber":"6029","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"112","articleId":"233257","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":233279,"authors":[{"name":"I.D.

Adoption of typical soft-switched inverters such as the resonant DC link inverter, require the use of discrete pulse modulation strategies. New controller structures are necessary to cope with stringent voltage regulation and distortion constraints in the presence of unbalanced and nonlinear loads. A controller that utilizes a load current feedforward strategy with a cost function current regulator to achieve excellent transient performance characteristics is presented. Voltage regulation is ensured using a synchronous frame regulator. Detailed simulation and experimental results verifying the concepts are presented. Although this work focuses on soft-switching inverters, the control concepts can be applied to conventional hard-switching inverters as well.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel3/63/6030/00233284.pdf","startPage":"279","endPage":"287","doi":"10.1109/63.233284","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/63.233284","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6030","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Discrete pulse modulation strategies for high-frequency inverter systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/233284/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"July  1993","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  1993","displayDocTitle":"Discrete pulse modulation strategies for high-frequency inverter systems","publicationDate":"July 1993","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4526871","isJournal":true,"volume":"8","issue":"3","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Discrete pulse modulation strategies for high-frequency inverter systems","sourcePdf":"00233284.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.028947S","chronDate":"July  1993","isNumber":"6030","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"50","articleId":"233284","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":233285,"authors":[{"name":"X.

However, the six-valve topology requires a three-level or trilogic PWM strategy that can handle feedback signals. A general method of translating three-phase biologic PWM signals into three-phase trilogic PWM signals is presented. The method of translation retains the characteristics of the bilogic PWM, including the frequency bandwidth. Experiments show that the trilogic PWM signals produced by the method can handle not only stabilizing feedback signals but also signals for active filtering.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Unity PF current-source rectifier based on dynamic trilogic PWM","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","doi":"10.1109/63.233285","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel3/63/6030/00233285.pdf","startPage":"288","endPage":"294","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/63.233285","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6030","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=233285","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/233285/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"July  1993","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  1993","displayDocTitle":"Unity PF current-source rectifier based on dynamic trilogic PWM","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"8","issue":"3","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"July 1993","accessionNumber":"4526872","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Unity PF current-source rectifier based on dynamic trilogic PWM","sourcePdf":"00233285.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.079131S","chronDate":"July  1993","isNumber":"6030","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"91","articleId":"233285","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":233286,"authors":[{"name":"X.

The converter can regulate the output voltage at a constant switching frequency in the range of load resistance from full-load resistance to infinity while maintaining good part-load efficiency. The efficiency of the converter is almost independent of the input voltage. For switching frequencies slightly above the resonant frequency, power switches are always inductively loaded, which is very advantageous if MOSFETs are used as switches. Experimentally results are given for a converter with a center-tapped rectifier at an output power of 52 W and a switching frequency of 127 kHz.

It is noted that progress has been made in RF-SQUIDs towards practical low-noise sensors. The flux noise values obtained from planar thin-film devices made of both conventional and high-temperature superconductors are comparable to what is currently obtainable with DC-SQUIDs. RF-SQUIDs seem to offer somewhat lower values of low-frequency excess noise than DC-SQUIDs at frequencies below 1 Hz. To obtain optimum sensitivity, it seems advisable for RF-SQUIDs to use a cooled preamplifier. The losses in cooling liquid due to dissipation in the amplifier are negligible in the case of liquid nitrogen, and lead to an increased evaporation of liquid helium on the order of 100 ml/day. Starting from bulk material devices with relatively high flux noise levels, at present the best high-T/sub c/ RF-SQUIDs offer a field sensitivity of less than 200 fT/ square root Hz (at 1Hz). This is already sufficient for a number of biomedical applications.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/77.233463","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6032","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/77.233463","endPage":"2010","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Applied Superconductivity","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Applied Superconductivity","pdfPath":"/iel4/77/6032/00233463.pdf","startPage":"2003","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Progress in RF-SQUIDs","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1993","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1993","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/233463/","displayDocTitle":"Progress in RF-SQUIDs","volume":"3","issue":"1","accessionNumber":"4470373","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"March 1993","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Progress in RF-SQUIDs","sourcePdf":"00233463.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.052789S","chronDate":"March  1993","isNumber":"6032","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"77","citationCount":"21","articleId":"233463","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":233464,"authors":[{"name":"J.P.

MicroSQUID can also be used with a room-temperature magnet to image the magnetic susceptibility of materials. A diamagnetic or paramagnetic sample is scanned in the applied field, and the local perturbations are measured. For thin samples, such as plates, sheets, or thin sections of rock, the data are deconvolved to generate two-dimensional susceptibility images. Three-dimensional structures can be imaged with magnetic susceptibility tomography: deconvolution of a large data set obtained by applying the field and scanning in multiple orientations. Extremely small surface defects on nonmagnetic or weakly magnetic samples are imaged by decorating the sample with paramagnetic microspheres prior to scanning.

Input signal voltages were integrated as current in a superconducting inductor. A single junction quantizer provided analog-to-digital (AID) conversion at 40 GHz and fed back single-flux-quantum (SFQ) voltage pulses to balance the input. A JSIM calculation for a 13,110,000-ps interval indicated ideal first-order noise shaping of a 2.44-MHz voltage-source signal. Spur free dynamic range was 102 dB and signal-to-noise-and-distortion was 98 dB on the DC 10-MHz signal band, equivalent to a 16-b, 20-MSample/s, Nyquist-rate A/D. The modulator transfer function was derived for a current-source signal applied to an input resistor. First-order quantization noise suppression was still observed for signal bands wider than the 2 pi R/L modulator cutoff frequency.

The simulation shows that this converter can achieve a 70-dB signal-to-noise ratio (S/(N+D)) with an oversampling ratio of 128. This corresponds to an 11-b resolution.

The maximum available applied field, produced by the Helmholtz pair, is 300 mu T, which provides an adequate signal-to-noise ratio for common susceptible materials. The calculated variation in the applied field within 20 mm of the center is less than 0.1% of the field at the center. In a 100-Hz bandwidth, the minimum detectable susceptibility-induced field change, (limited by SQUID noise) is 3*10/sup -9/ of the applied field. The sensitivity of the system may be improved by increasing the applied field, for instance by incorporating a superconducting magnet into the magnetometer dewar, and by using lower-noise SQUIDs.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/77.233580","startPage":"1941","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Applied Superconductivity","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Applied Superconductivity","pdfPath":"/iel4/77/6032/00233580.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/77.233580","endPage":"1944","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6032","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A high resolution imaging susceptometer","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/233580/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1993","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1993","displayDocTitle":"A high resolution imaging susceptometer","volume":"3","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4473500","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"March 1993","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A high resolution imaging susceptometer","sourcePdf":"00233580.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.04197S","chronDate":"March  1993","isNumber":"6032","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"77","citationCount":"14","articleId":"233580","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":233736,"authors":[{"name":"E.E.

The directivity characteristics of those transducers measured experimentally are presented.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Ultrasonic transducers","Plastics","Acoustic transducers","Ceramics","Acoustic beams","Resonance","Transfer functions","Piezoelectric transducers","Ultrasonic imaging","Focusing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ultrasonic transducers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Bessel function distribution","vibrational amplitude","surface","far field","near field","ultrasonic circular transducer","vibrational characteristics","ceramic ring","plastic disk","directivity patterns"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ULTSYM.1991.234211","publicationTitle":"IEEE 1991 Ultrasonics Symposium,","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE 1991 Ultrasonics Symposium,","pdfPath":"/iel2/886/6033/00234211.pdf","startPage":"477","endPage":"480 vol.1","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6033","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ULTSYM.1991.234211","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Ultrasonic transducers with Bessel function distribution of vibrational amplitude on their surface","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=234211","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Ultrasonic transducers with Bessel function distribution of vibrational amplitude on their surface","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/234211/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1991","accessionNumber":"4411693","conferenceDate":"8-11 Dec. 1991","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 Dec 1991","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Ultrasonic transducers with Bessel function distribution of vibrational amplitude on their surface","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"00234211.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.033085S","chronDate":"8-11 Dec 1991","isNumber":"6033","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"886","articleId":"234211","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":234240,"authors":[{"name":"M.

In this transition region from below to above threshold, the linewidth versus injection current characteristic is found to be nonmonotonic: a local minimum of linewidth just below threshold and a local maximum just above threshold are confirmed experimentally. If a semiconductor laser works below threshold as a resonant optical amplifier or optical filter, the small-signal frequency bandwidth is found to be equivalent to the spontaneous emission linewidth. When the laser amplifier is used simultaneously as a photodetector, the maximum value of photodetection sensitivity is achieved with the laser amplifier biased between 98% and 99% of the threshold current. The Fokker-Planck equation method is employed in the linewidth calculation. A numerical computer simulation is also performed using the rate-equation model. A reasonable agreement between theory and experiment is obtained.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Semiconductor lasers","Resonance","Semiconductor optical amplifiers","Laser transitions","Optical filters","Laser modes","Optical amplifiers","Stimulated emission","Optical sensors","Frequency"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optical filters","photodetectors","semiconductor lasers","sensitivity","spectral line breadth"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["below threshold","semiconductor lasers","resonant-type laser amplifiers","threshold region","transition region","above threshold","linewidth","injection current characteristic","resonant optical amplifier","optical filter","small-signal frequency bandwidth","spontaneous emission linewidth","photodetector","photodetection sensitivity","Fokker-Planck equation method","linewidth calculation","numerical computer simulation","rate-equation model"]}],"doi":"10.1109/3.234399","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Quantum Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Quantum Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel1/3/6035/00234399.pdf","startPage":"1488","endPage":"1497","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6035","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/3.234399","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Near threshold operation of semiconductor lasers and resonant-type laser amplifiers","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=234399","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Near threshold operation of semiconductor lasers and resonant-type laser amplifiers","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/234399/","volume":"29","issue":"6","publicationDate":"June 1993","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4555554","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1993","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1993","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Near threshold operation of semiconductor lasers and resonant-type laser amplifiers","sourcePdf":"00234399.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.077602S","chronDate":"Jun 1993","isNumber":"6035","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3","citationCount":"10","articleId":"234399","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":234401,"authors":[{"name":"K.F.

The theoretical model takes into account conduction band nonparabolicity and band-gap renormalization. The gain spectrum is calculated from the theoretical spontaneous emission spectrum, and both compare very well with experimental data. From a fit to the observed temperature dependence of ASE for an LED and the gain spectrum for an LD with a structure identical to that of the LED except for mirror reflectivity, it is possible to establish carrier density as a function of injection current for both devices. It is shown that photons fluctuating into cavity modes give rise to substantial subthreshold carrier pinning in laser diodes. These fluctuations extract an extra current from the device and play an increasingly important role with increasing temperature.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/3.234415","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/3.234415","startPage":"1631","endPage":"1639","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Quantum Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel1/3/6035/00234415.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Quantum Electronics","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6035","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Amplified spontaneous emission and carrier pinning in laser diodes","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1993","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1993","displayDocTitle":"Amplified spontaneous emission and carrier pinning in laser diodes","publicationDate":"June 1993","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","volume":"29","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4555572","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/234415/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Amplified spontaneous emission and carrier pinning in laser diodes","sourcePdf":"00234415.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.045505S","chronDate":"Jun 1993","isNumber":"6035","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3","citationCount":"52","articleId":"234415","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":234417,"authors":[{"name":"J.D.

An estimated lifetime in terms of spectral linewidth, FM response, and lasing wavelength of over 10/sup 5/ has been obtained, demonstrating that these devices are suitable for practical use in gigabit/second coherent optical fiber communication systems.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/3.234428","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Quantum Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Quantum Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel1/3/6035/00234428.pdf","startPage":"1728","endPage":"1735","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/3.234428","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6035","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High performance and highly reliable lambda /4 shifted MQW-DFB-DC-PBH-LDs for Gb/s coherent optical communication systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=234428","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1993","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1993","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/234428/","displayDocTitle":"High performance and highly reliable lambda /4 shifted MQW-DFB-DC-PBH-LDs for Gb/s coherent optical communication systems","volume":"29","issue":"6","publicationDate":"June 1993","accessionNumber":"4561754","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High performance and highly reliable lambda /4 shifted MQW-DFB-DC-PBH-LDs for Gb/s coherent optical communication systems","sourcePdf":"00234428.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.049419S","chronDate":"Jun 1993","isNumber":"6035","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3","citationCount":"7","articleId":"234428","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":234433,"authors":[{"name":"K.

Unique reduction mechanisms of adiabatic chirp and linewidth are found in distributed reflector (DR) lasers and complex-coupled (CC) (i.e., gain+index-coupled) DSM lasers, which are explained from the viewpoints of modal phase and modal gain behaviours. For CC-DSM lasers, it is shown that the arrangement of index and gain corrugation, namely, antiphase or in-phase combination, will suppress or enhance, respectively, an effective linewidth enhancement factor, alpha /sub eff/.

Efficient attenuation small hole pileup and small chirp characteristics of a discrete modulator based on this MQW structure were demonstrated experimentally. A study of the controllability of in-plane band-gap energy by the use of selective-area metal-organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) was also demonstrated. The modulator was monolithically integrated with a MQW DFB laser of the same material. Using a low-capacitance semi-insulating buried heterostructure, over 14 GHz modulation under high-light-output operations up to +10 dBm was achieved.

Both theoretical analysis and experiments show that the measurement sensitivity is improved with the increased bevel angle of the probe. Calibration results using water and air at low frequencies are in agreement with theoretical calculations. Measurements on three biological samples (sonicated DNA macromolecules, water solutions of protein (the protamine), and in -aminocaproic acid) were made from 1 MHz to 1 GHz. All the measured results are in very good agreement with similar tests obtained from the same materials using a standard probe.

A clock-recovery circuit successfully extracts a low-jitter 10-GHz clock signal of 1-dBm constant power from 10-Gb/s NRZ pseudorandom bit streams using a pulse pattern generator.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design and performance of clock recovery GaAs ICs for high-speed optical communication systems","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","doi":"10.1109/22.234506","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel1/22/6037/00234506.pdf","startPage":"745","endPage":"751","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/22.234506","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6037","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=234506","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/234506/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1993","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1993","displayDocTitle":"Design and performance of clock recovery GaAs ICs for high-speed optical communication systems","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"41","issue":"5","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"May 1993","accessionNumber":"4549554","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design and performance of clock recovery GaAs ICs for high-speed optical communication systems","sourcePdf":"00234506.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.039028S","chronDate":"May 1993","isNumber":"6037","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"10","articleId":"234506","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":234507,"authors":[{"name":"J.C.

A model based on surface states was proposed to explain this phenomenon, which then led to the use of charge-screen layers and a double-recessed gate process to suppress surface effects. Combined, these two modifications increased the device's gate-drain reverse breakdown voltage without causing a degradation in the transistor's RF drain current. This allowed the simultaneous achievement of high power-added efficiency and high power density which established a new performance record for power PHEMTs at X- and Ku-bands. Delay time analysis of single- and double-recessed PHEMTs revealed that the benefit of a larger breakdown voltage in the latter device design came at the cost of a larger drain delay time. Drain delay accounted for 45% of the total delay when the 0.35- mu m double-recessed PHEMT was biased at V/sub ds/=6 V.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/234507/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1993","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1993","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"41","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May 1993","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4549555","displayDocTitle":"An AlGaAs/InGaAs pseudomorphic high electron mobility transistor with improved breakdown voltage for X- and Ku-band power applications","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An AlGaAs/InGaAs pseudomorphic high electron mobility transistor with improved breakdown voltage for X- and Ku-band power applications","sourcePdf":"00234507.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.05045S","chronDate":"May 1993","isNumber":"6037","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"68","articleId":"234507","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":234519,"authors":[{"name":"J.

The prediction is made by geometrically transforming, or warping, the previous image using the point pairs defined by the mapping as fixed points in the transformation. This method produces a prediction image without block artifacts and can compensate for many motion types where conventional block matching fails, such as scaling and rotation. It can also be incorporated in existing hybrid video compression systems with little additional complexity and few or no changes in the bit stream syntax. It is shown that a significant subjective improvement in the prediction as well as a consistent reduction in the objectively measured prediction error is obtained.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/30.234575","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/30.234575","startPage":"141","endPage":"150","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel1/30/6040/00234575.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6040","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A novel video coding scheme based on temporal prediction using digital image warping","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"8-10 Jun 1993","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 Jun 1993","displayDocTitle":"A novel video coding scheme based on temporal prediction using digital image warping","publicationDate":"Aug. 1993","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","volume":"39","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4536787","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/234575/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A novel video coding scheme based on temporal prediction using digital image warping","sourcePdf":"00234575.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.053696S","chronDate":"8-10 Jun 1993","isNumber":"6040","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"30","citationCount":"55","articleId":"234575","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":234591,"authors":[{"name":"F.-O.

The adaptive equalization, which is called a modified 'stop-and-go' algorithm (MSGA), is based on the combination of the constant modulus algorithm (CMA) and a 'stop-and-go' algorithm (SGA). The CMA is first used to initialize the coefficients; once initialized, the CMA is switched to the MSGA to complete the equalizer convergence. In order to obtain faster convergence, the Sato-like errors used in the SGA are replaced by errors used for updating coefficients in the CMA. The carrier recovery for coupling with the adaptive equalization uses the decision-directed technique. The calculation of absolute sum of error gives a simple and reliable way of switching from CMA to MSGA for the adaptive equalizer's coefficient updating procedure. Test results confirm that the proposed scheme is robust against impulsive and/or nonimpulse noise, multipaths, and carrier errors such as frequency offset, phase offset, and phase jitter.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel1/30/6040/00234610.pdf","startPage":"386","endPage":"391","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics","doi":"10.1109/30.234610","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/30.234610","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6040","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=234610","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive blind equalization coupled with carrier recovery for HDTV modem","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Adaptive equalizers","Blind equalizers","HDTV","Convergence","TV","Modems","Decision feedback equalizers","Testing","Noise robustness","Phase noise"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive filters","equalisers","high definition television","modems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["impulsive noise","HDTV modem","modified stop and go algorithm","carrier recovery","adaptive blind equalization","high-definition television","constant modulus algorithm","coefficients","equalizer convergence","decision-directed technique","nonimpulse noise","multipaths","carrier errors","frequency offset","phase offset","phase jitter"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/234610/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 Jun 1993","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"8-10 Jun 1993","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive blind equalization coupled with carrier recovery for HDTV modem","volume":"39","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 1993","accessionNumber":"4561868","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive blind equalization coupled with carrier recovery for HDTV modem","sourcePdf":"00234610.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.028818S","chronDate":"8-10 Jun 1993","isNumber":"6040","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"30","citationCount":"22","articleId":"234610","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":234611,"authors":[{"name":"Hiroaki Ohki","affiliation":["Sony Corp., Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Hiroaki","lastName":"Ohki","id":"37088253255"},{"name":"Kenji Hasegawa","affiliation":["Sony Corp., Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Kenji","lastName":"Hasegawa","id":"37088781755"},{"name":"Jun-ya Suzuki","affiliation":["Sony Corp., Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Jun-ya","lastName":"Suzuki","id":"37087676292"},{"name":"Hiroyuki Mori","affiliation":["Sony Corp., Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Hiroyuki","lastName":"Mori","id":"37088302238"},{"name":"Osamu Nishima","affiliation":["Sony Corp., Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Osamu","lastName":"Nishima","id":"37088074474"},{"name":"Yukinobu Wataya","affiliation":["Sony Corp., Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Yukinobu","lastName":"Wataya","id":"37088076516"},{"name":"Hiroshi Mori","affiliation":["Sony Corp., Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Hiroshi","lastName":"Mori","id":"37614234000"},{"name":"Eiji Machisima","affiliation":["Sony Corp., Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Eiji","lastName":"Machisima","id":"37088780171"},{"name":"Mitsuru Yamashita","affiliation":["Sony Corp., Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Mitsuru","lastName":"Yamashita","id":"37088785226"},{"name":"Koichiro Uchimura","affiliation":["Sony Corp., Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Koichiro","lastName":"Uchimura","id":"37088787294"},{"name":"Kazuomi Ezoe","affiliation":["Sony Corp., Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Kazuomi","lastName":"Ezoe","id":"37088263172"},{"name":"Tamaike Ikezawa","affiliation":["Sony Corp., Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Tamaike","lastName":"Ikezawa","id":"37088780681"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0098-3063"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-4127"}],"articleNumber":"234611","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":46},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Consumer Electronics Society","url":"http://www.ewh.ieee.org/soc/ces/index.html"}],"abstract":"A 510-pixel (H)*492-pixel (V) IT (interline transfer) CCD (charge coupled device) with 3.65-mm (H)*2.73-mm (V) image area, corresponding to a 1/4-in optical format, has been developed.

Then a mixing operation is used to restore the missing block by extracting the features obtained from the different directional interpolations and combining them together.

The automation is based on the exploration of the design space and schemes for efficient memory replacement, algorithm formulation, architecture design, and evaluation method. Various schemes and design considerations were integrated to produce a parameterized MBA (memory-based architecture) that can easily be tuned to various hardware-speed requirements. This MBA is characterized by three design parameters. Differently configured MBAs result from specifying different values for these parameters. Hardware-speed evaluation formulas were established based on the required elements in MBAs. These elements include ROM, adders, and shift registers. These formulas and a cell library of a target technology can be used to design an optimally configured MBA by searching for the best values of the design parameters with the aid of a computer. Using the evaluation formulas and the parameterized architecture, an area-minimized architecture can be synthesized under a speed specification. Based on these results, an automatic synthesis too has been developed.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the design automation of the memory-based VLSI architectures for FIR filters","doi":"10.1109/30.234644","startPage":"619","endPage":"629","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/30.234644","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6040","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel1/30/6040/00234644.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=234644","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"8-10 Jun 1993","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/234644/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 Jun 1993","displayDocTitle":"On the design automation of the memory-based VLSI architectures for FIR filters","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"39","issue":"3","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 1993","accessionNumber":"4561887","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the design automation of the memory-based VLSI architectures for FIR filters","sourcePdf":"00234644.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.044217S","chronDate":"8-10 Jun 1993","isNumber":"6040","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"30","citationCount":"20","articleId":"234644","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":234645,"authors":[{"name":"S.

Hence, the effective carrier-to-noise ratio threshold is smaller than what is calculated by assuming random-noise performance. A method for calculating the quantization noise power with a given bit-precision for an A/D converter is described. This involves the calculations of the peak-to-average ratio of the QAM scheme of interest. This analysis can then be used to determine the bit-precision requirements of the A/D converter, which has a direct correlation to the cost of a QAM receiver.

A phi -channel represents a fractional, simplex, end-to-end communication channel between a source and a destination. The channel is characterized by a set of specific performance parameters associated with its traffic. The required performance characteristics of a phi -channel are specified in terms of the packet maximum end-to-end delay and the maximum number of packets that can be sent over that delay. The primary attribute supported by the phi -channel is the on-time reliability.

Systems aimed at effectively managing image data have generally approached the problem from two different views: They either possess a strong database component with little image understanding, or they serve as an image repository for computer vision applications, with little emphasis on the image retrieval process. A general architecture for visual information-management systems (VIMS), which combine the strengths of both approaches, is presented. The system utilizes computer vision routines for both insertion and retrieval and allows easy query-by-example specifications. The vision routines are used to segment and evaluate objects based on domain-knowledge describing the objects and their attributes. The vision system can then assign feature values to be used for similarity-measures and image retrieval. A VIMS developed for face-image retrieval is presented to demonstrate these ideas.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/234774/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1993","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1993","publicationDate":"Aug. 1993","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4551265","volume":"5","issue":"4","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A visual information management system for the interactive retrieval of faces","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A visual information management system for the interactive retrieval of faces","sourcePdf":"00234774.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.060341S","chronDate":"Aug 1993","isNumber":"6047","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"69","citationCount":"67","articleId":"234774","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":234776,"authors":[{"name":"A.F.

However, using the most favorable IS settings very often makes the length of regeneration cycles infinite or impractically long. To address this problem, a methodology that uses IS dynamically within each regeneration cycle to drive the system back to the regeneration state after an accurate estimate has been obtained is discussed. A statistically based technique for optimizing IS parameter values for simulations of queueing systems, including complex systems with bursty arrival processes, is formulated. A deterministic variant of stochastic simulated annealing (SA), called mean field annealing (MFA), is used to minimize statistical estimates of the IS estimator variance. The technique is demonstrated by evaluating blocking probabilities.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/234852/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1993","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1993","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"June 1993","accessionNumber":"4533419","volume":"1","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Statistical optimization of dynamic importance sampling parameters for efficient simulation of communication networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Statistical optimization of dynamic importance sampling parameters for efficient simulation of communication networks","sourcePdf":"00234852.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.041416S","chronDate":"Jun 1993","isNumber":"6050","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"90","citationCount":"61","articleId":"234852","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":234855,"authors":[{"name":"A.I.

It is the maximal real eigenvalue of a matrix that is directly obtained from the source characteristics and the admission criterion, and for several sources it is simply additive. Both fluid and point process models are considered.

The network is assumed to be a virtual circuit, connection-based packet network. It is shown that the use of generalized processor sharing (GPS), when combined with leaky bucket admission control, allows the network to make a wide range of worst-case performance guarantees on throughput and delay. The scheme is flexible in that different users may be given widely different performance guarantees and is efficient in that each of the servers is work conserving. The authors present a practical packet-by-packet service discipline, PGPS that closely approximates GPS. This allows them to relate results for GPS to the packet-by-packet scheme in a precise manner. The performance of a single-server GPS system is analyzed exactly from the standpoint of worst-case packet delay and burstiness when the sources are constrained by leaky buckets.

The approach is based on properly bounding the probability distribution functions of the system input processes. The suggested bounds which are decaying exponentials, possess three convenient properties. When the inputs to an isolated network element are all bounded, they result in bounded outputs and assure that the delays and queues in this element have exponentially decaying distributions. In some network settings, bounded inputs result in bounded outputs. Natural traffic processes can be shown to satisfy such bounds. Consequently, this method enables the analysis of various previously intractable setups. Sufficient conditions are provided for the stability of such networks, and derive upper bounds for the parameters of network performance are derived.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance and stability of communication networks via robust exponential bounds","publicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking","doi":"10.1109/90.234858","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking","pdfPath":"/iel4/90/6050/00234858.pdf","startPage":"372","endPage":"385","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/90.234858","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6050","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=234858","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/234858/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1993","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1993","displayDocTitle":"Performance and stability of communication networks via robust exponential bounds","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"1","issue":"3","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"June 1993","accessionNumber":"4533425","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance and stability of communication networks via robust exponential bounds","sourcePdf":"00234858.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.054965S","chronDate":"Jun 1993","isNumber":"6050","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"90","citationCount":"179","articleId":"234858","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":234892,"authors":[{"name":"K.J.

This contrasts sharply with the case of ample resources, where S provides allocations that are provably close to the optimum. Two alternative allocation algorithms are suggested.

Performance measurements of an implementation of consistent checkpointing are described. The measurements show that consistent checkpointing performs remarkably well. Eight computation-intensive distributed applications were executed on a network of 16 diskless Sun-3/60 workstations, and the performance without checkpointing was compared to the performance with consistent checkpoints taken at two-minute intervals. For six of the eight applications, the running time increased by less than 1% as a result of the checkpointing. The highest overhead measured was 5.8%. Incremental checkpointing and copy-on write checkpointing were the most effective techniques in lowering the running time overhead. It is argued that these measurements show that consistent checkpointing is an efficient way to provide fault tolerance for long-running distributed applications.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"[1992] Proceedings 11th Symposium on Reliable Distributed Systems","pdfPath":"/iel2/422/6053/00235144.pdf","startPage":"39","endPage":"47","publicationTitle":"[1992] Proceedings 11th Symposium on Reliable Distributed Systems","doi":"10.1109/RELDIS.1992.235144","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RELDIS.1992.235144","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6053","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=235144","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The performance of consistent checkpointing","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Checkpointing","Costs","File servers","Computer science","Workstations","Magnetic heads","Fault tolerance","Application software","Measurement","Performance evaluation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data integrity","distributed processing","fault tolerant computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["transparent fault tolerance","long-running distributed applications","consistent checkpointing","computation-intensive distributed applications","diskless Sun-3/60 workstations","copy-on write checkpointing"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/235144/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-7 Oct 1992","displayDocTitle":"The performance of consistent checkpointing","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1992","accessionNumber":"4468132","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"5-7 Oct. 1992","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The performance of consistent checkpointing","confLoc":"Houston, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"00235144.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.03842S","chronDate":"5-7 Oct 1992","isNumber":"6053","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"422","citationCount":"193","articleId":"235144","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":235198,"authors":[{"name":"X.

The ability to display arbitrary combinations of an algorithm's data objects in a common frame of reference, coupled with interactive control of algorithm execution, provides a powerful way to understand algorithm behavior.

A graphical display, including user interaction with the display, is modeled by a special data type. Mappings from the scalar types into the display model type provide a simple user interface for controlling how all data types are depicted, without the need for type-specific graphics logic.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-23 Oct 1992","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/235215/","accessionNumber":"4450906","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1992","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"19-23 Oct. 1992","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Display of scientific data structures for algorithm visualization","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Display of scientific data structures for algorithm visualization","confLoc":"Boston, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"00235215.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.036018S","chronDate":"19-23 Oct 1992","isNumber":"6054","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"423","citationCount":"15","articleId":"235215","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":235230,"authors":[{"name":"S.

Wavelet transform is a signal analysis technique which decomposes a signal using a family of functions having a local property in both time and frequency domains. A multiresolution expression of 3D volume data was first obtained by applying 3D orthogonal wavelet transforms, with the shape then being approximated with a relatively small number of 3D orthogonal functions using only the significant functions. In addition, the resolution of the approximation can be varied point by point using the local property of the wavelets. The method is applied to real volume data, i.e. facial range data and MR images of a human head, and typical results are shown.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/VISUAL.1992.235230","publicationTitle":"Proceedings Visualization '92","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings Visualization '92","pdfPath":"/iel2/423/6054/00235230.pdf","startPage":"21","endPage":"28","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VISUAL.1992.235230","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6054","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Approximation and rendering of volume data using wavelet transforms","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=235230","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-23 Oct 1992","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/235230/","displayDocTitle":"Approximation and rendering of volume data using wavelet transforms","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1992","accessionNumber":"4450891","conferenceDate":"19-23 Oct. 1992","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Approximation and rendering of volume data using wavelet transforms","confLoc":"Boston, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"00235230.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048516S","chronDate":"19-23 Oct 1992","isNumber":"6054","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"423","citationCount":"33","articleId":"235230","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":235261,"authors":[{"name":"M.

An approximate method for the fast transient simulation of the ERASE cycle is presented. A comparison of experiments and simulations demonstrates the relevance of the non-steady-state effects, and supports the validity of the presented transient solution.

The amplifier operates at 33 kV, 1.6 A in the TE/sub 10/ rectangular waveguide mode at the fundamental cyclotron frequency. Small signal gain in excess of 20 dB has been demonstrated over a wide (33%) frequency range with this device. Recent narrowband large signal measurements have demonstrated a saturated efficiency of around 10%, corresponding to a peak power of 5 kW at 35 GHz. Attempts to increase the amplifier gain and efficiency further have been limited, however, by the onset of oscillations due to insufficient output circuit match. A stability study has been performed to assist in the optimization of the present device, and to aid in the design of a follow-on two-stage experiment. The study has focused on the parametric dependence of the start oscillation current threshold on the velocity ratio, the magnetic field detuning, and the output port reflection coefficient.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6055","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IEDM.1991.235308","publicationTitle":"International Electron Devices Meeting 1991 [Technical Digest]","displayPublicationTitle":"International Electron Devices Meeting 1991 [Technical Digest]","pdfPath":"/iel5/606/6055/00235308.pdf","startPage":"779","endPage":"781","doi":"10.1109/IEDM.1991.235308","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Investigation of the stability of a tapered gyro-TWT amplifier","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 Dec. 1991","displayDocTitle":"Investigation of the stability of a tapered gyro-TWT amplifier","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"8-11 Dec. 1991","publicationDate":"1991","accessionNumber":"4367910","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/235308/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Investigation of the stability of a tapered gyro-TWT amplifier","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"00235308.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.032115S","chronDate":"8-11 Dec. 1991","isNumber":"6055","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"606","citationCount":"5","articleId":"235308","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":235319,"authors":[{"name":"W.

It is shown that the transport and detrapping properties of holes generated near the anode can account for the differences observed after unipolar and bipolar oxide stressing. Bipolar stress yields a lower rate of bulk charge trapping and longer time to breakdown than unipolar stress. The difference is dependent on both field and frequency. At the same time, bipolar stress leads to enhanced interface trap generation. Since the gate-drain overlap region of MOSFETs in circuits is subject to bipolar stress, DC transistor stress tests may underestimate the MOSFET degradation rate. The observation that interface trap density does not saturate during bipolar stress as readily as during unipolar stress is particularly alarming. Bidirectional tunneling current creates a larger number of interface traps than does unidirectional gate current. Even though unipolar stressed devices suffer more bulk trapping and TDDB (time-dependent dielectric breakdown) degradation than do bipolar stressed devices, the degradation in transconductance, mobility, and threshold voltage is worse in bipolar stressed devices.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The effects of oxide stress waveform on MOSFET performance","publicationTitle":"International Electron Devices Meeting 1991 [Technical Digest]","doi":"10.1109/IEDM.1991.235322","displayPublicationTitle":"International Electron Devices Meeting 1991 [Technical Digest]","pdfPath":"/iel5/606/6055/00235322.pdf","startPage":"719","endPage":"722","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IEDM.1991.235322","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6055","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=235322","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/235322/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 Dec. 1991","displayDocTitle":"The effects of oxide stress waveform on MOSFET performance","conferenceDate":"8-11 Dec. 1991","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1991","accessionNumber":"4367896","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The effects of oxide stress waveform on MOSFET performance","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"00235322.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.033719S","chronDate":"8-11 Dec. 1991","isNumber":"6055","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"606","citationCount":"13","articleId":"235322","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":235332,"authors":[{"name":"Y.

The titanium silicided source region (Rs=7 Omega / Square Operator ) of driver transistors is common to both in a cell, so there is little imbalance of the ground line. The 14-fA off-current (Vd=3 V, Vg=0 V) of the TFT makes possible less than 0.3- mu A standby current in a 16-Mb SRAM.

The SEA cell realizes 64-Mb/256-Mb DRAMs (dynamic RAMs) by using a simple stacked capacitor without complicated storage electrode structures such as a 'crown' or 'fin'.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/IEDM.1991.235355","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IEDM.1991.235355","publicationTitle":"International Electron Devices Meeting 1991 [Technical Digest]","displayPublicationTitle":"International Electron Devices Meeting 1991 [Technical Digest]","pdfPath":"/iel5/606/6055/00235355.pdf","startPage":"465","endPage":"468","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6055","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A self-amplifying (SEA) cell for future high density DRAMs","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/235355/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 Dec. 1991","displayDocTitle":"A self-amplifying (SEA) cell for future high density DRAMs","conferenceDate":"8-11 Dec. 1991","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1991","accessionNumber":"4367863","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A self-amplifying (SEA) cell for future high density DRAMs","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"00235355.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.037183S","chronDate":"8-11 Dec. 1991","isNumber":"6055","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"606","citationCount":"5","articleId":"235355","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":235374,"authors":[{"name":"B.

The criterion for this comparison is the 'end-of-life' magnitude of subthreshold off-current at zero gate-to-source voltage, projected from accelerated hot-carrier stress. Shifts in off-current depend on changes in threshold voltage and subthreshold slope. The minimum channel length which satisfies the lifetime criterion of 100% shift in off-current for surface channels is 0.3 mu m. The minimum channel length of buried channels must be increased by approximately=0.25 mu m over that of surface channels to meet the same lifetime criterion.

These mechanisms include the build-up of charge densities by the (secondary emitter) cathode in excess of that required to supply the anode current and the effect of space charge on the production of fluctuations in the current carried through an individual spoke to the anode. In comparisons with measured S/N (signal-to-noise) ratios, computed results have, in some cases, done surprisingly well, reproducing certain known trends (showing increasing S/N ratio with increasing drive power, for example) and even producing decent quantitative agreement with measured RF output fluctuation levels. The general level of agreement is far from perfect, however, and certain further model improvements and tests are necessary before final judgments can be offered as to the applicability of simulation codes to the calculation of actual noise powers above a floor level determined by the nature of the simulation algorithms and the computer on which they are run.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/IEDM.1991.235400","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IEDM.1991.235400","startPage":"593","endPage":"596","displayPublicationTitle":"International Electron Devices Meeting 1991 [Technical Digest]","pdfPath":"/iel5/606/6055/00235400.pdf","publicationTitle":"International Electron Devices Meeting 1991 [Technical Digest]","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6055","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Computer studies of noise generation in crossed-field amplifiers","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 Dec. 1991","displayDocTitle":"Computer studies of noise generation in crossed-field amplifiers","conferenceDate":"8-11 Dec. 1991","publicationDate":"1991","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"4362664","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/235400/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Computer studies of noise generation in crossed-field amplifiers","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"00235400.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053588S","chronDate":"8-11 Dec. 1991","isNumber":"6055","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"606","citationCount":"2","articleId":"235400","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":235433,"authors":[{"name":"D.A.

These effects can result in increased drain current over what is expected from stationary transport theory (i.e. velocity saturation), and in decreased hot-carrier energy spectrum spread, or carrier temperature, leading to improved device reliability. However, the magnitude of these effects depends strongly not only on channel length but also on overall device design such as channel doping configuration, drain junction depth, etc. Besides minimization of junction depths, optimal device design requires a super-steep-retrograde channel doping, with surface doping concentration no higher than mid-10/sup 16/ cm/sup -3/. This can be achieved with indium doping for NMOS, and antimony or arsenic doping for PMOS extreme submicron transistors.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Physics and technology of ultra short channel MOSFET devices","publicationTitle":"International Electron Devices Meeting 1991 [Technical Digest]","doi":"10.1109/IEDM.1991.235433","displayPublicationTitle":"International Electron Devices Meeting 1991 [Technical Digest]","pdfPath":"/iel5/606/6055/00235433.pdf","startPage":"21","endPage":"24","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IEDM.1991.235433","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6055","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=235433","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/235433/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 Dec. 1991","displayDocTitle":"Physics and technology of ultra short channel MOSFET devices","conferenceDate":"8-11 Dec. 1991","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1991","accessionNumber":"4362631","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Physics and technology of ultra short channel MOSFET devices","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"00235433.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044564S","chronDate":"8-11 Dec. 1991","isNumber":"6055","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"606","citationCount":"35","articleId":"235433","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":235442,"authors":[{"name":"S.

The method makes use of avalanche hot carrier injection after erasure by Fowler-Nordheim tunneling. The threshold voltages converge to a certain 'steady-state' as a result of the injection. The steady-state is caused by a balance between avalanche hot electron injection into the floating gate and avalanche hot hole injection into the floating gate, and can be controlled easily by the channel doping. Tight distribution of threshold voltages and stable erasure without over-erased cells are demonstrated by applying cells using 0.6- mu m CMOS technology.

SOAs are under rapid development to achieve polarization independent gain, low facet reflectivities, good coupling to optical fibers, and high saturation power. The package SOA can be made compact and possibly inexpensive, but its main advantage is the potential for optoelectronic integration. SOAs may be used as boosters and preamplifiers, but in the case of multichannel systems attention must be given to the inherent nonlinear behavior that is due to the short lifetime of the injected carrier density. On the other hand, short lifetime will allow SOAs to be used as gates, modulators, detectors, and frequency converters for signals with gigabit per second data rates.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ICIPRM.1992.235594","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIPRM.1992.235594","startPage":"242","endPage":"245","displayPublicationTitle":"LEOS 1992 Summer Topical Meeting Digest on Broadband Analog and Digital Optoelectronics, Optical Multiple Access Networks, Integrated Optoelectronics, and Smart Pixels","pdfPath":"/iel2/625/6056/00235594.pdf","publicationTitle":"LEOS 1992 Summer Topical Meeting Digest on Broadband Analog and Digital Optoelectronics, Optical Multiple Access Networks, Integrated Optoelectronics, and Smart Pixels","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6056","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Recent advances in semiconductor optical amplifiers and their applications","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-24 April 1992","displayDocTitle":"Recent advances in semiconductor optical amplifiers and their applications","conferenceDate":"21-24 April 1992","publicationDate":"1992","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"4463162","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/235594/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Recent advances in semiconductor optical amplifiers and their applications","confLoc":"Newport, RI, USA","sourcePdf":"00235594.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.035447S","chronDate":"21-24 April 1992","isNumber":"6056","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"625","citationCount":"2","articleId":"235594","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":235623,"authors":[{"name":"D.A.H.

It is noted that future WDM (wavelength division multiplexing) systems presently being evaluated will benefit significantly from advances in the development of wavelength-controlled space switches. The TGA can in principle be operated as either a wavelength-independent or wavelength-selective switch depending on the bias injection currents, a flexibility hitherto unavailable. An additional benefit is the possibility of lossless integration, i.e., the inclusion of several functions such as amplification, space switching, power splitting, filtering and connection to external fibers in one device without (fiber-to-fiber) loss. These devices could give rise to new opportunities in multiwavelength networks, such as the flexible provision of services. Experimental results are presented which show how the TGA can be used as a wavelength-controlled switch which is not sensitive to small (<1-nm) fluctuations in the wavelength of the launched light.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ICIPRM.1992.235623","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIPRM.1992.235623","startPage":"573","endPage":"575","displayPublicationTitle":"LEOS 1992 Summer Topical Meeting Digest on Broadband Analog and Digital Optoelectronics, Optical Multiple Access Networks, Integrated Optoelectronics, and Smart Pixels","pdfPath":"/iel2/625/6056/00235623.pdf","publicationTitle":"LEOS 1992 Summer Topical Meeting Digest on Broadband Analog and Digital Optoelectronics, Optical Multiple Access Networks, Integrated Optoelectronics, and Smart Pixels","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6056","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Y-branch wavelength-controlled space switch using a twin-guide laser amplifier","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-24 April 1992","displayDocTitle":"Y-branch wavelength-controlled space switch using a twin-guide laser amplifier","conferenceDate":"21-24 April 1992","publicationDate":"1992","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"4459397","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/235623/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Y-branch wavelength-controlled space switch using a twin-guide laser amplifier","confLoc":"Newport, RI, USA","sourcePdf":"00235623.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046249S","chronDate":"21-24 April 1992","isNumber":"6056","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"625","citationCount":"1","articleId":"235623","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":236145,"authors":[{"name":"J.W.

Starting with the steady-state electron and photon rate equations, the model calculates the above threshold light-current (LI) characteristics. Included are temperature effects, spatial hole burning effects, carrier diffusion, surface recombination, and an estimation of optical losses. The model shows that the saturation of output power in the experimental devices is due to carrier leakage over the heterojunction and not simply the shifting of the gain peak relative to the cavity mode.

The robustness of HONN training is considered in terms of target detectability. The experimental setup consists of a 15*20 pixel scene possibly containing a 3*10 target. Each trial used 500 training scenes plus 500 testing scenes. Results indicate that HONNs yield similar geometric invariant target recognition properties to classical template matching.

This approach is independent of the initial state and produces natural hierarchical clustering solutions by going through a sequence of phase transitions. It is modified for a larger class of optimization problems by adding constraints to the free energy. The concept of constrained clustering is explained, and three examples are are given in which it is used to introduce deterministic annealing. The previous clustering method is improved by adding cluster mass variables and a total mass constraint. The traveling salesman problem is reformulated as constrained clustering, yielding the elastic net (EN) approach to the problem. More insight is gained by identifying a second Lagrange multiplier that is related to the tour length and can also be used to control the annealing process. The open path constraint formulation is shown to relate to dimensionality reduction by self-organization in unsupervised learning. A similar annealing procedure is applicable in this case as well.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/34.236251","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel1/34/6064/00236251.pdf","startPage":"785","endPage":"794","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/34.236251","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6064","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Constrained clustering as an optimization method","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=236251","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1993","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1993","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/236251/","displayDocTitle":"Constrained clustering as an optimization method","volume":"15","issue":"8","publicationDate":"Aug. 1993","accessionNumber":"4500753","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Constrained clustering as an optimization method","sourcePdf":"00236251.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.0377S","chronDate":"Aug 1993","isNumber":"6064","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"127","articleId":"236251","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":236252,"authors":[{"name":"F.P.

Darboux frames are used to describe the local surface, whereas snakes are used to interpolate between features, particularly those that serve to partition a surface into its constituent parts. Superquadrics are used to characterize the 3-D shape of each surface partition. The result is a set of connected volumetric primitives that serve to describe the overall shape of an object.

This system, called NEURO-NAV, discards the more traditional geometrical representation of the environment, and instead uses a semantically richer nonmetrical representation in which a hallway is modeled by the order of appearance of various landmarks and by adjacency relationships. With such a representation, it becomes possible for the robot to respond to commands such as, 'follow the corridor and turn right at the second T junction'. This capability is achieved by an ensemble of neural networks whose activation and deactivation are controlled by a rule-based supervisory controller. The individual neural networks in the ensemble are trained to interpret visual information and perform primitive navigational tasks such as hallway following and landmark detection.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  1993","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/236323/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct.  1993","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4548424","volume":"13","issue":"5","publicationDate":"Oct. 1993","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Mobile robot navigation using neural networks and nonmetrical environmental models","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Mobile robot navigation using neural networks and nonmetrical environmental models","sourcePdf":"00236323.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.050091S","chronDate":"Oct.  1993","isNumber":"6067","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5488303","citationCount":"54","articleId":"236323","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":236354,"authors":[{"name":"E.J.

A framework for strong-signal MFP based on standard statistical estimation theory, in which MFP is regarded as essentially an estimation problem in the strong-signal regime, is developed. In the weak-signal case, the necessary requirement of detection dictates that MFP then be considered a joint detection-estimation task. It is demonstrated that, generally, MFP is essentially a space-time processing problem rather than simply an array processing (spatial processing only) procedure. An overview of the processing schemes used to date in MFP is given, showing how these methods relate to the optimal space-time structure. Weak-signal detection and estimation scenarios relevant to MFP are then noted. Present methods for dealing with the inherent instability of MFP algorithms (mismatch) are discussed. The current status of MFP is summarized, and recommendations for future research are made.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul 1993","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/236354/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul 1993","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4536827","volume":"18","issue":"3","publicationDate":"July 1993","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Estimation and detection issues in matched-field processing","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Estimation and detection issues in matched-field processing","sourcePdf":"00236354.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.067073S","chronDate":"Jul 1993","isNumber":"6068","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"48","citationCount":"39","articleId":"236354","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":236360,"authors":[{"name":"C.E.

The cost function used by the algorithm is the Bartlett matched-field processor (MFP), which related the measured acoustic field with replica fields calculated by the SAFARI fast field program. Model parameters are perturbed randomly, and the algorithm searches the multidimensional parameter space of geoacoustic models to determine the parameter set that optimizes the output of the MFP. Convergence is driven by adaptively guiding the search to regions of the parameter space associated with above-average values of the MFP. The performance of the algorithm is demonstrated for a vertical line array in a shallow water enviornment where the bottom consists of homogeneous elastic solid layers. Simulated data are used to determine the limits on estimation performance due to error in experimental geometry and to noise contamination. The results indicate that reasonable estimates are obtained for moderate conditions of noise and uncertainty in experimental geometry.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/JOE.1993.236360","startPage":"224","endPage":"231","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Oceanic Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel1/48/6068/00236360.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Oceanic Engineering","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JOE.1993.236360","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6068","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Matched field inversion for geoacoustic model parameters using adaptive simulated annealing","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Geometry","Nonlinear acoustics","Optimization methods","Simulated annealing","Cost function","Acoustic measurements","Pollution measurement","Multidimensional systems","Convergence","Water pollution"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["acoustic arrays","acoustic signal processing","adaptive systems","geophysical techniques","geophysics computing","oceanographic techniques","seismology","simulated annealing","sonar","underwater sound"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["matched field inversion","explosion seismology","ocean bottom","marine geophysics","elastic sediments","sonar","prospecting technique","geoacoustic model parameters","adaptive simulated annealing","acoustic field data","nonlinear optimization","cost function","Bartlett matched-field processor","measured acoustic field","replica fields","SAFARI fast field program","multidimensional parameter space","vertical line array","shallow water enviornment","homogeneous elastic solid layers","noise"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/236360/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul 1993","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul 1993","displayDocTitle":"Matched field inversion for geoacoustic model parameters using adaptive simulated annealing","volume":"18","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"July 1993","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4536833","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Matched field inversion for geoacoustic model parameters using adaptive simulated annealing","sourcePdf":"00236360.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.031614S","chronDate":"Jul 1993","isNumber":"6068","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"48","citationCount":"78","articleId":"236360","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":236367,"authors":[{"name":"H.

In flight control applications of this kind, difficulties arise because the system to be controlled is highly nonlinear and coupled, and there is a good deal of parameter uncertainty and variation with operational conditions. The development of variable-structure control in the form of sliding modes has been shown to provide robustness that is expected to be quite remarkable for AUV autopilot design. It is shown that a multivariable sliding-mode autopilot based on state feedback, designed assuming decoupled modeling, is quite satisfactory for the combined speed, steering, and diving response of a slow AUV. The influence of speed, modeling nonlinearity, uncertainty, and disturbances, can be effectively compensated, even for complex maneuvering. Waypoint acquisition based on line-of-sight guidance is used to achieve path tracking.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/JOE.1993.236372","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Oceanic Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Oceanic Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel1/48/6068/00236372.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JOE.1993.236372","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6068","startPage":"327","endPage":"339","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multivariable sliding mode control for autonomous diving and steering of unmanned underwater vehicles","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=236372","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Multivariable sliding mode control for autonomous diving and steering of unmanned underwater vehicles","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul 1993","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/236372/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul 1993","isJournal":true,"volume":"18","issue":"3","publicationDate":"July 1993","accessionNumber":"4536845","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multivariable sliding mode control for autonomous diving and steering of unmanned underwater vehicles","sourcePdf":"00236372.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.03895S","chronDate":"Jul 1993","isNumber":"6068","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"48","citationCount":"616","articleId":"236372","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":236476,"authors":[{"name":"A.C.

When trained using traditional backpropagation, however, they are often susceptible to local minima. The use of genetic algorithm exploratory procedures that can often locate near-optimal solutions to complex problems to overcome this, is discussed. The genetic algorithm maintains a set of trial solutions and forces them to evolve toward an acceptable solution. A representation for possible solutions must first be developed. Then, with an initial random population, the algorithm uses survival of the fittest techniques as well as old knowledge in the gene pool to improve each generation's ability to solve the problem. This improvement is achieved through a four-step process of evaluation, reproduction, breeding, and mutation.

A very simple model for the input signal vectors that greatly simplifies analysis of the convergence behavior of the LMS and NLMS algorithms is proposed. Using this model, answers can be obtained to questions for which no answers are currently available using other (perhaps more realistic) models. Examples are given to illustrate that even quantitatively, the answers obtained can be good approximations. It is emphasized that the convergence of the NLMS algorithm can be speeded up significantly by employing a time-varying step size.

Fractionally differenced Gaussian noise is a discrete-time equivalent of fractional Brownian motion. Filtered versions of such processes are ideally suited for modeling signals with different short-term and long-term correlation structure. Two iterative algorithms for estimating the parameters of filtered fdGn processes are described. The first technique is based on the expectation-maximization algorithm. It converges to a stationary point of the log-likelihood function corresponding to the parameters of the model. The second technique is a computationally efficient approximate approach. It is found to converge experimentally, but no proof of its convergence is given. The usefulness of filtered fdGn models and the performance of the proposed iterative algorithms are illustrated by fitting filtered fdGn models to speech waveforms and other data corresponding to natural phenomena.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/78/6071/00236506.pdf","startPage":"2839","endPage":"2849","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/78.236506","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/78.236506","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6071","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=236506","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Signal modeling with filtered discrete fractional noise processes","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Signal processing","1f noise","Autoregressive processes","Gaussian noise","Filters","Iterative algorithms","Parameter estimation","Brownian motion","Signal processing algorithms","Fractals"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["filtering and prediction theory","fractals","iterative methods","parameter estimation","random noise","signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["signal modelling","fractals","filtered discrete fractional noise processes","fractionally differenced Gaussian noise","discrete-time equivalent","fractional Brownian motion","correlation structure","iterative algorithms","filtered fdGn processes","expectation-maximization algorithm","log-likelihood function","computationally efficient approximate approach","speech waveforms"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/236506/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1993","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1993","displayDocTitle":"Signal modeling with filtered discrete fractional noise processes","volume":"41","issue":"9","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 1993","accessionNumber":"4563664","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Signal modeling with filtered discrete fractional noise processes","sourcePdf":"00236506.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.030389S","chronDate":"Sep 1993","isNumber":"6071","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"48","articleId":"236506","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":236507,"authors":[{"name":"J.

In pt.I the performance of the MUSIC algorithms for narrowband direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation when the array manifold and noise covariance are not correctly modeled was investigated. This analysis is extended to multidimensional subspace-based algorithms including deterministic (or conditional) maximum likelihood, MD-MUSIC, weighted subspace fitting (WSF), MODE, and ESPRIT. A general expression for the variance of the DOA estimates that can be applied to any of the above algorithms and to any of a wide variety of scenarios is presented. Optimally weighted subspace fitting algorithms are presented for special cases involving random unstructured errors of the array manifold and noise covariance. It is shown that one-dimensional MUSIC outperforms all of the above multidimensional algorithms for random angle-independent array perturbations.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/78.236510","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","startPage":"2882","endPage":"2890","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/78/6071/00236510.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/78.236510","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6071","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A performance analysis of subspace-based methods in the presence of model error.

By minimizing the worse case asymptotic variance, robust, structured, maximum-likelihood-type estimates of the spatial correlation matrix in the presence of noises with probability density functions in the in -contamination and Kolmogorov classes are obtained. These estimates are robust against variations in the noise's amplitude distribution. The Kolmogorov class is demonstrated to be the natural class to use for array processing applications, and a technique is developed to determine exactly the size of this class. Performance of bearing estimation algorithms improves substantially when the robust estimates are used, especially when nonGaussian noise is present.

The mass and center of mass estimates are made using a least squares estimator derived from the principles of consistency of the Radon transform. The convex hull estimate is produced by first estimating the positions of support lines of the object from each available projection and then estimating the overall convex hull using prior shape information. Estimating the position of two support lines from a single projection is accomplished using a generalized likelihood ratio technique for estimating jumps in linear systems.

The object of interest is assumed to have a very small spatial spread and is obscured by correlated clutter of much larger spatial extent. The correlated clutter is predicted and subtracted from the input signal, leaving components of the spatially small signal in the residual output. The receiver operating characteristics of a detection system augmented by a TDLMS prewhitening filter are plotted using Monte-Carlo techniques. It is shown that such a detector has better operating characteristics than a conventional matched filter in the presence of correlated clutter. For very low signal-to-background ratios, TDLMS-based detection systems show a considerable reduction in the number of false alarms. The output energy in both the residual and prediction channels of such filters is shown to be dependent on the correlation length of the various components in the input signal. False alarm reduction and detection gains obtained by using this detection scheme on thermal infrared sensor data with known object positions is presented.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance evaluation of 2-D adaptive prediction filters for detection of small objects in image data","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","doi":"10.1109/83.236534","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/83/6072/00236534.pdf","startPage":"327","endPage":"340","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/83.236534","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6072","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=236534","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/236534/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"July  1993","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  1993","displayDocTitle":"Performance evaluation of 2-D adaptive prediction filters for detection of small objects in image data","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"2","issue":"3","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"July 1993","accessionNumber":"4502504","pubMedId":"18296221","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance evaluation of 2-D adaptive prediction filters for detection of small objects in image data","sourcePdf":"00236534.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.036964S","chronDate":"July  1993","isNumber":"6072","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"68","articleId":"236534","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-27"},{"_id":236536,"authors":[{"name":"C.

The RLS fuzzy adaptive filter is constructed through the following four steps: (1) define fuzzy sets in the filter input space Rn whose membership functions cover U; (2) construct a set of fuzzy IF-THEN rules which either come from human experts or are determined during the adaptation procedure by matching input-output data pairs; (3) construct a filter based on the set of rules; and (4) update the free parameters of the filter using the RLS algorithm. The design procedure for the LMS fuzzy adaptive filter is similar. The most important advantage of the fuzzy adaptive filters is that linguistic information (in the form of fuzzy IF-THEN rules) and numerical information (in the form of input-output pairs) can be combined in the filters in a uniform fashion.

This connectionist fuzzy classifier, called CFC, realizes the weighted-Euclidean-distance fuzzy classification concept in a massively parallel manner to recognize input patterns. CFC employs a hybrid supervised/unsupervised learning scheme to organize referenced pattern vectors. This scheme not only overcomes the major drawbacks of multilayer perceptron models using the backpropagation algorithm, i.e., the local minimal problem and long training time, but also avoids the disadvantage of the huge storage space requirement of the probabilistic neural network. According to experimental results, CFC shows better accuracy for speech recognition than several existing methods, even in a noisy environment. Moreover, it has higher stability of recognition rates for different environmental conditions. A massively parallel hardware architecture has been developed to implement CFC. A bus-oriented multiprocessor, systolic processor structure, and pipelining are used to obtain low-cost, high-performance fuzzy classification.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A fuzzy neural network model and its hardware implementation","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems","doi":"10.1109/91.236550","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems","pdfPath":"/iel4/91/6073/00236550.pdf","startPage":"171","endPage":"183","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/91.236550","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6073","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=236550","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/236550/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1993","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1993","displayDocTitle":"A fuzzy neural network model and its hardware implementation","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"1","issue":"3","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Aug. 1993","accessionNumber":"4552260","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A fuzzy neural network model and its hardware implementation","sourcePdf":"00236550.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.040496S","chronDate":"Aug 1993","isNumber":"6073","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"91","citationCount":"15","articleId":"236550","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":236552,"authors":[{"name":"R.J.

Akaike's (1970) final prediction error. They apply the technique to the problem of predicting corporate bond ratings. This problem is very attractive as a case study, since it is characterized by the limited availability of the data and by the lack of complete a priori information that could be used to impose a structure to the network architecture.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-11 Oct 1991","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/236576/","accessionNumber":"4362601","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1991","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"9-11 Oct. 1991","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Selecting neural network architectures via the prediction risk: application to corporate bond rating prediction","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Selecting neural network architectures via the prediction risk: application to corporate bond rating prediction","confLoc":"New York, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"00236576.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052874S","chronDate":"9-11 Oct 1991","isNumber":"6074","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"361","citationCount":"30","articleId":"236576","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":236588,"authors":[{"name":"S.

There are two ways to use BTDH for LSAs. BTDH can be used with an LSA to form a new scheduling algorithm (LSA/BTDH), and it can be used as a pure optimization algorithm for an LSA (LSA-BTDH). BTDH has been applied with two well-known LSAs: the highest level first with estimated time (HLFET) and the earlier task first (ETF) heuristics. Simulation results show that, given a directed acyclic growth (DAG), the graph parallelism of the DAG can accurately predict the number of processors to be used such that a good scheduling length and a good resource utilization (or efficiency) can be achieved simultaneously. In terms of speedups, LSA/BTDH >or= LSA-BTDH >or= ETF >or= HLFET. Experimental results of scheduling FFT programs, which are written in a single program multiple data (SPMD) programming approach, on NCUBE-2 are also presented.

An efficient formulation of tree search on a SIMD machine comprises two major components: (i) a triggering mechanism, which determines when the search space redistribution must occur to balance search space over processors; and (ii) a scheme to redistribute the search space. The authors devised a redistribution mechanism and a triggering mechanism. Either of these can be used in conjunction with triggering and redistribution mechanisms developed by other researchers. The authors analyze the scalability of these mechanisms. The results are verified experimentally. The analysis and experiments show that the novel load balancing methods are highly scalable on SIMD architectures. Their scalability is shown to be no worse than that of the best load balancing schemes on MIMD (multiple-instruction multiple-data) architectures. The authors verified their theoretical results by implementing the 15-puzzle problem on a CM-2 SIMD parallel computer.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SUPERC.1992.236658","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6075","publicationTitle":"Supercomputing '92:Proceedings of the 1992 ACM/IEEE Conference on Supercomputing","displayPublicationTitle":"Supercomputing '92:Proceedings of the 1992 ACM/IEEE Conference on Supercomputing","pdfPath":"/iel2/390/6075/00236658.pdf","endPage":"462","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Unstructured tree search on SIMD parallel computers: a summary of results","doi":"10.1109/SUPERC.1992.236658","startPage":"453","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=236658","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-20 Nov 1992","displayDocTitle":"Unstructured tree search on SIMD parallel computers: a summary of results","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/236658/","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4441765","publicationDate":"1992","conferenceDate":"16-20 Nov. 1992","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Unstructured tree search on SIMD parallel computers: a summary of results","confLoc":"Minneapolis, MN, USA","sourcePdf":"00236658.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.038872S","chronDate":"16-20 Nov 1992","isNumber":"6075","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"390","citationCount":"7","articleId":"236658","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":236659,"authors":[{"name":"A.

The second is a parallel version of the event-driven algorithm that achieves a speedup of 6.3 with eight processors. The third is a complete parallel and vector version of the event-driven algorithm that achieves a speedup of 52 on the Cray Y-MP with eight processors.

The dimensions of the space are words and the initial vectors are determined by the words occurring close to the entity to be represented, which implies that the space has several thousand dimensions (words). This makes the vector representations (which are dense) too cumbersome to use directly. Therefore, dimensionality reduction by means of a singular value decomposition is employed.

The relationship between the dependence abstraction called dependence cones and fully permutable loop nests is shown. Compound transformations are modeled as matrices. Nonsingular linear transformations that subsume the class of unimodular transformations are presented. Nonunimodular transformations (with determinant>or=1) create 'holes' in the transformed iteration space. The step size of loops is changed in order to 'step aside from these holes' when traversing the transformed iteration space. For the class of nonunimodular loop transformations, algorithms for deriving the loop bounds, the array access expressions, and step sizes of loops in the nest are given. The algorithms are based on the Hermite normal form of the transformation matrix.

To that end, programs in LAPACK were studied for which it was possible to examine both the block version and the corresponding point algorithm. For each of these programs, it was determined whether a plausible compiler technology could succeed in obtaining the block version from the point algorithm. The results are encouraging: one can block triangular and trapezoidal loops, and many of the problems introduced by complex dependence patterns can be overcome by the use of the transformation known as index-set splitting. In addition, it was shown that knowledge about which operations commute can enable a compiler to succeed in blocking codes that could not be blocked by any compiler based strictly on dependence analysis.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"Supercomputing '92:Proceedings of the 1992 ACM/IEEE Conference on Supercomputing","pdfPath":"/iel2/390/6075/00236704.pdf","startPage":"114","endPage":"124","publicationTitle":"Supercomputing '92:Proceedings of the 1992 ACM/IEEE Conference on Supercomputing","doi":"10.1109/SUPERC.1992.236704","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SUPERC.1992.236704","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6075","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=236704","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Compiler blockability of numerical algorithms","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Program processors","Programming profession","Optimizing compilers","Microprocessors","Algorithm design and analysis","Computer science","Design optimization","High performance computing","Delay","History"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["matrix algebra","parallel programming","program compilers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["parallel programming","numerical algorithms","LAPACK","block version","point algorithm","compiler technology","complex dependence patterns","index-set splitting"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/236704/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-20 Nov 1992","displayDocTitle":"Compiler blockability of numerical algorithms","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1992","accessionNumber":"4437653","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"16-20 Nov. 1992","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Compiler blockability of numerical algorithms","confLoc":"Minneapolis, MN, USA","sourcePdf":"00236704.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.024292S","chronDate":"16-20 Nov 1992","isNumber":"6075","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"390","citationCount":"39","articleId":"236704","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":236867,"authors":[{"name":"H.

The filter is realized by additions only, so implementation is very easy. The computation amount decreases to one-fortieth compared with full-search ME through using this algorithm.

On the other hand, the algorithm is more computationally efficient and easier to implement than other multiscale corner detectors.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"[Proceedings 1992] IEEE International Conference on Systems Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel2/669/6078/00236905.pdf","startPage":"596","endPage":"599","publicationTitle":"[Proceedings 1992] IEEE International Conference on Systems Engineering","doi":"10.1109/ICSYSE.1992.236905","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSYSE.1992.236905","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6078","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=236905","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Wavelet transform for corner detection","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wavelet transforms","Data structures","Detectors","Computer vision","Large Hadron Collider","Smoothing methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["edge detection","wavelet transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["edge detection","image recognition","corner detection","wavelet transform"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/236905/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-19 Sep 1992","displayDocTitle":"Wavelet transform for corner detection","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1992","accessionNumber":"4446187","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"17-19 Sept. 1992","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Wavelet transform for corner detection","confLoc":"Kobe, Japan","sourcePdf":"00236905.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057508S","chronDate":"17-19 Sep 1992","isNumber":"6078","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"669","citationCount":"3","articleId":"236905","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":236922,"authors":[{"name":"D.

The basic idea is to employ the robot for laborious, repetitive, or dangerous work whereas the human acts as a supervisor and handles exceptions. One benchmark problem chosen for the Cooperating Robot (COR) is to remove dishes from trays and put them into a dishwasher. The layout of the controller for the COR, which has to deal with a variety of sensor information and derive appropriate commands for the actuators (more than 20 different ones in the case considered) is described. The controller consists of several finite state machines running in parallel. Each state machine correspond to a task associated with a specific priority. The state machines are synchronized by means of signals. A multiprocessor multitasking development system makes implementation of such a control structure easy. The presented control strategy was proved to deal effectively with the information provided by more than 40 sensors.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ICSYSE.1992.236922","publicationTitle":"[Proceedings 1992] IEEE International Conference on Systems Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"[Proceedings 1992] IEEE International Conference on Systems Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel2/669/6078/00236922.pdf","startPage":"143","endPage":"146","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSYSE.1992.236922","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6078","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Control architecture for a robot with visual and tactile capabilities skilled in sorting dishes","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/236922/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-19 Sep 1992","displayDocTitle":"Control architecture for a robot with visual and tactile capabilities skilled in sorting dishes","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1992","accessionNumber":"4446170","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"17-19 Sept. 1992","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Control architecture for a robot with visual and tactile capabilities skilled in sorting dishes","confLoc":"Kobe, Japan","sourcePdf":"00236922.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.032462S","chronDate":"17-19 Sep 1992","isNumber":"6078","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"669","citationCount":"2","articleId":"236922","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":236929,"authors":[{"name":"R.

It is very useful for achieving highly reliable communications in channels corrupted by noise and intersymbol interference, such as a telephone subscriber channel and a mobile communications channel. Two types of structures and algorithms for combined equalization and decoding are presented. Equalization can achieve stable adaptation for unknown characteristics and/or variance of a channel by using some information obtained in decoding, while decoding can be modified to adapt to the condition of a channel by exploiting information from equalization. In particular, a method to utilize the reliability of decoded data for equalization and an adaptive decoding scheme based on the combined decoding and equalization are proposed.

The cell is fabricated using a phase-shift photolithography that includes a method for making 0.25 mu m space patterns with the conventional stepper. To reduce cell area, the concept of small cell-ratio is introduced. To overcome the unstable operation of the small-ratio cell, an advanced poly-Si PMOS transistor for load devices is used. To simultaneously obtain stable operation and extremely low standby power dissipation for the memory cell, a self-aligned offset structure for the poly-Si PMOS transistor is proposed and demonstrated. An extremely small leakage current of 2-fA/cell and an on/off-current ratio of 4.6*10/sup 6/ are achieved with this transistor in a memory cell.

Poly-Si/sub 1-x/Ge/sub x/ films with Ge mole fractions up to 0.6 were found to be completely compatible with standard VLSI fabrication processes in regard to deposition and patterning techniques, high-temperature chemical and mechanical stability, and electrical stability and uniformity.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A polycrystalline-Si/sub 1-x/Ge/sub x/-gate CMOS technology","publicationTitle":"International Technical Digest on Electron Devices","doi":"10.1109/IEDM.1990.237181","displayPublicationTitle":"International Technical Digest on Electron Devices","pdfPath":"/iel5/878/6081/00237181.pdf","startPage":"253","endPage":"256","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IEDM.1990.237181","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6081","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=237181","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/237181/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-12 Dec. 1990","displayDocTitle":"A polycrystalline-Si/sub 1-x/Ge/sub x/-gate CMOS technology","conferenceDate":"9-12 Dec. 1990","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1990","accessionNumber":"4127196","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A polycrystalline-Si/sub 1-x/Ge/sub x/-gate CMOS technology","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00237181.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.029839S","chronDate":"9-12 Dec. 1990","isNumber":"6081","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"878","citationCount":"32","articleId":"237181","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":237213,"authors":[{"name":"N.

It is clarified experimentally that a flash memory cell written and erased by Fowler-Nordheim (F-N) tunneling has ten times the retention time of the conventional cell, which is written by channel-hot-electron (CHE) injection and erased by F-N tunneling. This difference of data retentivity between these two write/erase (W/E) technologies is due to decreasing the thin gate oxide leakage current by bi-polarity F-N tunneling stress. This improvement in data retention becomes more pronounced as the gate oxide thickness decreases. Therefore, a bipolarity F-N tunneling WE technology, which enables a flash EEPROM cell to scale down its oxide thickness, shows promise as a key technology for realizing 16 Mb flash EEPROMs and beyond.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/IEDM.1990.237214","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IEDM.1990.237214","publicationTitle":"International Technical Digest on Electron Devices","displayPublicationTitle":"International Technical Digest on Electron Devices","pdfPath":"/iel5/878/6081/00237214.pdf","startPage":"111","endPage":"114","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6081","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A reliable bi-polarity write/erase technology in flash EEPROMs","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/237214/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-12 Dec. 1990","displayDocTitle":"A reliable bi-polarity write/erase technology in flash EEPROMs","conferenceDate":"9-12 Dec. 1990","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1990","accessionNumber":"4127163","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A reliable bi-polarity write/erase technology in flash EEPROMs","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00237214.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.030222S","chronDate":"9-12 Dec. 1990","isNumber":"6081","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"878","citationCount":"33","articleId":"237214","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":237215,"authors":[{"name":"G.

It is noted that these technologies together with advanced lithography techniques will be sufficient for the manufacture of future 64 Mbit EPROMs and beyond.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/237218/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-12 Dec. 1990","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"1990","accessionNumber":"4127159","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"9-12 Dec. 1990","isConference":true,"displayDocTitle":"Process and device technologies for 16 Mbit EPROMs with large-tilt-angle implanted p-pocket cell","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Process and device technologies for 16 Mbit EPROMs with large-tilt-angle implanted p-pocket cell","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00237218.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.030951S","chronDate":"9-12 Dec. 1990","isNumber":"6081","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"878","citationCount":"9","articleId":"237218","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":237219,"authors":[{"name":"B.J.

This flash memory technology uses a buried N/sup +/ bitline to connect the memory transistors rather than metal and contacts. Elimination of contacts results in a 45% cell area shrink of the conventional ETOX cell (based on 1.0 mu m design rules). A 4.48 mu m/sup 2/ cell area is also realized by using a 0.8 mu m technology. In addition to this cell scalability, the diffusion corner induced erase threshold bimodality can be reduced due to the intrinsic stripe geometries in the memory array. Furthermore, this contact/metal related layout rules can be relaxed, which allows this contactless approach to be extended to future generations without requiring complicated contact processing. Hence, the flash array contactless EPROM (FACE) technology lends itself to a very compact cell as well as a more manufacturable process.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","publicationTitle":"International Technical Digest on Electron Devices","displayPublicationTitle":"International Technical Digest on Electron Devices","pdfPath":"/iel5/878/6081/00237219.pdf","startPage":"91","endPage":"94","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A novel memory cell using flash array contactless EPROM (FACE) technology","doi":"10.1109/IEDM.1990.237219","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6081","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IEDM.1990.237219","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=237219","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/237219/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-12 Dec. 1990","displayDocTitle":"A novel memory cell using flash array contactless EPROM (FACE) technology","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1990","accessionNumber":"4127158","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"9-12 Dec. 1990","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A novel memory cell using flash array contactless EPROM (FACE) technology","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00237219.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044726S","chronDate":"9-12 Dec. 1990","isNumber":"6081","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"878","citationCount":"11","articleId":"237219","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-28"},{"_id":237456,"authors":[{"name":"M.

The four basic operations of signal modeling, i.e. spectral shaping, spectral analysis, parametric transformation, and statistical modeling, are discussed. Three important trends that have developed in the last five years in speech recognition are examined. First, heterogeneous parameter sets that mix absolute spectral information with dynamic, or time-derivative, spectral information, have become common. Second, similarity transform techniques, often used to normalize and decorrelate parameters in some computationally inexpensive way, have become popular. Third, the signal parameter estimation problem has merged with the speech recognition process so that more sophisticated statistical models of the signal's spectrum can be estimated in a closed-loop manner. The signal processing components of these algorithms are reviewed.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/237532/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  1993","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  1993","volume":"81","issue":"9","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Sept. 1993","accessionNumber":"4557390","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Signal modeling techniques in speech recognition","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Signal modeling techniques in speech recognition","sourcePdf":"00237532.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.020091S","chronDate":"Sept.  1993","isNumber":"6088","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"181","articleId":"237532","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":237536,"authors":[{"name":"A.-J.

Both known and new SVD-based identification methods are classified in a subspace-oriented scheme. The SVD of a matrix constructed from the observed signal data provides the key step in a robust discrimination between desired signals and disturbing signals in terms of signal and noise subspaces. The methods that are presented are distinguished by the way in which the subspaces are determined and how the signal or system model parameters are extracted from these subspaces. Typical examples, such as the direction-of-arrival problem and system identification from input/output measurements, are elaborated upon, and some extensions to time-varying systems are given.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/5.237536","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel1/5/6088/00237536.pdf","startPage":"1277","endPage":"1308","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/5.237536","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6088","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Subspace-based signal analysis using singular value decomposition","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  1993","displayDocTitle":"Subspace-based signal analysis using singular value decomposition","volume":"81","issue":"9","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4557392","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 1993","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/237536/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  1993","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Subspace-based signal analysis using singular value decomposition","sourcePdf":"00237536.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.089816S","chronDate":"Sept.  1993","isNumber":"6088","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"223","articleId":"237536","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":237538,"authors":[{"name":"A.

The principal recording components, namely, the recording head and the medium, are considered, focusing on the problems encountered in designing, optimizing, and realizing them for gigabit-density applications. The performance of gigabit recording configurations from both IBM and Hitachi is reviewed. The performance limitations of these gigabit configurations and the prospects for further areal density extensions in magnetic recording are discussed.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/5.237542","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel1/5/6088/00237542.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6088","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/5.237542","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","startPage":"1344","endPage":"1359","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Gigabit-density magnetic recording","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=237542","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  1993","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  1993","displayDocTitle":"Gigabit-density magnetic recording","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/237542/","volume":"81","issue":"9","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 1993","accessionNumber":"4557395","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Gigabit-density magnetic recording","sourcePdf":"00237542.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.08072S","chronDate":"Sept.  1993","isNumber":"6088","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"34","articleId":"237542","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":237588,"authors":[{"name":"B.

In this study the resistor is replaced with a modified folded dipole which has a radiation resistance approximately equal to that of the matching resistor. Thus the input section has a traveling wave distribution up to the inserted antenna, as before, but now the power that was previously dissipated in the resistor is also radiated. Input impedance, current distribution, and radiation patterns of this antenna are computed, and input impedance and radiation patterns are also measured. Horizontally polarized patterns are similar to those of a horizontal dipole over a ground plane, and vertically polarized patterns in a plane orthogonal to the folded element are similar to those of a monopole over a ground plane. Coverage is also obtained in the zenith direction in the plane of the folded element, as long as it is not an integral number of half wavelengths above the ground plane.

Signal estimation is accomplished by a two-step maximum likelihood procedure: (i) The directions of arrival and polarization parameters of all the signals are estimated. (ii) The estimated signal is obtained as a linear combination of the array outputs, with weights which are computed from the estimated direction/polarization parameters. The objective of this study is to analyze the quality of the estimated signal in terms of the output signal-to-interference ratio (SIR) and output signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Closed-form expressions are derived for the output SIR and SNR of a general diversely polarized array. By evaluating these expressions for selected test cases it is shown that polarization-sensitive arrays can provide significantly higher output SIR and SNR than uniformly polarized arrays. The performance improvement is especially significant for closed spaced sources with sufficiently different polarization characteristics.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6090","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/8.237623","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel4/8/6090/00237623.pdf","startPage":"918","endPage":"925","doi":"10.1109/8.237623","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Maximum likelihood signal estimation for polarization sensitive arrays","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul 1993","displayDocTitle":"Maximum likelihood signal estimation for polarization sensitive arrays","volume":"41","issue":"7","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"July 1993","accessionNumber":"4536589","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/237623/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul 1993","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Maximum likelihood signal estimation for polarization sensitive arrays","sourcePdf":"00237623.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.068901S","chronDate":"Jul 1993","isNumber":"6090","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"32","articleId":"237623","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":237625,"authors":[{"name":"R.M.

The observations are explained by a resonance phenomenon in which the operating frequency is found to lie close to a complex natural frequency of the scattering object. This resonance is a real, observable effect predicted by analytical solutions and not the spurious numerical resonances which have been widely discussed and which one wishes to suppress. Attempts have been made to reproduce near-resonance scattering results using the method of moments and finite-difference-time-domain (FDTD) codes.

However, researchers have limited their investigation to materials that are either isotropic or that have diagonal permittivity, conductivity, and permeability tensors.

The analysis shows that the L/sub 2/-induced norm of a sampled-data system is smaller than gamma if certain discrete-time descriptor systems have no eigenvalue of magnitude one, and if a certain discrete-time linear time-invariant plant depending on gamma has H/sub infinity / norm smaller than gamma .

The achieved tracking of the prescribed knee motion, deviations of the thigh movement from the prescribed trajectory, maximal angular deviations from the desired trajectory, and the power consumption were studied as functions of a limited maximal knee torque and a damping constant in the knee actuator.

To detect such sounds, recordings of diastolic heart sound segments were analyzed using four signal processing techniques: the fast Fourier transform (FFT) autoregressive (AR), autoregressive moving-average (ARMA), and minimum-norm (eigenvector) methods. To further enhance the diastolic heart sounds and reduce background noise, an adaptive filter was used as a preprocessor. The power ratios of the FFT method and the poles of the AR, ARMA, and eigenvector methods were used to diagnose patients as having diseased or normal arteries using a blind protocol without prior knowledge of the actual disease states of the patients to guard against human bias. Of 80 cases, results showed that normal and abnormal records were correctly distinguished in 56 using the fast Fourier transform (FFT), in 63 using the AR, in 62 using the ARMA method, and in 67 using the eigenvector method. These results confirm that high-frequency acoustic energy between 300 and 800 Hz is associated with coronary stenosis.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Noninvasive acoustical detection of coronary artery disease: a comparative study of signal processing methods","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","doi":"10.1109/10.237677","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/10/6092/00237677.pdf","startPage":"571","endPage":"578","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/10.237677","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6092","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=237677","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/237677/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"June  1993","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  1993","displayDocTitle":"Noninvasive acoustical detection of coronary artery disease: a comparative study of signal processing methods","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"40","issue":"6","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"June 1993","accessionNumber":"4555519","pubMedId":"8262539","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Noninvasive acoustical detection of coronary artery disease: a comparative study of signal processing methods","sourcePdf":"237677.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.080422S","chronDate":"June  1993","isNumber":"6092","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"94","articleId":"237677","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":237680,"authors":[{"name":"M.

Spatially isolated dot electrodes in four geometries (monopolar, longitudinal tripolar, tripolar with four common anodes, and two parallel tripoles) were combined with transverse field steering current(s) from an anode(s) located 180 degrees around from the cathode(s) to activate different regions of the nerve trunk. A selectivity index was used to construct recruitment curves for a muscle with the optimal degree of selectivity. Physiological responses were correlated with the anatomical structure of the sciatic nerve by identifying the nerve fascicles innervating the four muscles, and by determining the relative positions of the electrodes and the nerve fascicles.

The right quadriceps of a paraplegic patient who was engaged in a functional electrical stimulation (FES) training program was used for the measurements. The muscle studied was considered trained, both relating to strength and fatigue resistance. Extended stimulation was applied with an adjustable electrical stimulator, providing monophasic rectangular pulse trains with a frequency of 20 Hz, pulse width of 0.2 ms, and an intensity of up to 220 mA. The intensity used corresponded to the intensity required for the tested patient to stand up. This intensity was selected to deliberately encourage fatigue, and the result was a gradual and steady decay of the muscle force due to fatigue. The model was able to predict the decaying force during continuous electrical stimulation, as well as to indicate the muscle parameters which yield the best fit between the model prediction and the previously obtained experimental force profiles.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A musculotendon model of the fatigue profiles of paralyzed quadriceps muscle under FES","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","doi":"10.1109/10.237696","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/10/6093/00237696.pdf","startPage":"664","endPage":"674","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/10.237696","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6093","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=237696","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/237696/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"July  1993","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  1993","displayDocTitle":"A musculotendon model of the fatigue profiles of paralyzed quadriceps muscle under FES","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"40","issue":"7","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"July 1993","accessionNumber":"4569364","pubMedId":"8244427","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A musculotendon model of the fatigue profiles of paralyzed quadriceps muscle under FES","sourcePdf":"237696.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.047888S","chronDate":"July  1993","isNumber":"6093","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"73","articleId":"237696","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-24"},{"_id":237709,"authors":[{"name":"H.R.

A deterministic ray-tracing propagation model is used to predict the time delay and fading characteristics for the channel in a hypothetical urban area. The analysis shows that due to multiple reflection and diffraction sources, the RMS delay spread of the channel in urban areas can be several hundred nanoseconds, so that very effective equalizers will be required to achieve successful performance of high-data-rate digital systems such as 20-Mb 16-QAM digital HDTV. The channel response results presented also suggest that polarization diversity may be a useful technique for mitigating some of the channel impairments predicted by the propagation model.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/11.237709","startPage":"309","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Broadcasting","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Broadcasting","pdfPath":"/iel1/11/6094/00237709.pdf","endPage":"317","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6094","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/11.237709","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1993","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1993","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/237709/","displayDocTitle":"A ray-tracing propagation model for digital broadcast systems in urban areas","volume":"39","issue":"3","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4561578","publicationDate":"Sept. 1993","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A ray-tracing propagation model for digital broadcast systems in urban areas","sourcePdf":"00237709.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.047537S","chronDate":"Sep 1993","isNumber":"6094","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"11","citationCount":"60","articleId":"237709","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":237718,"authors":[{"name":"K.

An analysis of fixed-point CORDIC in the Y-reduction mode, which allows computation of the inverse tangent function, shows that unnormalized input values can result in large numerical errors. The authors describe two approaches for tackling the numerical accuracy problem. The first approach builds on a fixed-point CORDIC unit and eliminates the problem by including additional hardware for normalization. A method for integrating the normalization operation with the CORDIC iterations for efficient implementation in O(n/sup 1.5/) hardware is provided. The second solution to the accuracy problem is to use a floating-point CORDIC unit but reduce the implementation complexity by using a hybrid architecture. Arguments to support the use of such an architecture in certain special-purpose arrays are presented.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hardware","Signal processing algorithms","Application software","Digital arithmetic","Computer architecture","Computer errors","Digital signal processing chips","Error analysis","Very large scale integration","Navigation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["digital arithmetic","signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["numerical accuracy","hardware tradeoffs","CORDIC arithmetic","special-purpose processors","coordinate rotation digital computer","real-time signal processing","Y-reduction mode","inverse tangent function","floating-point CORDIC","implementation complexity","hybrid architecture","special-purpose arrays"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=237718","doi":"10.1109/12.237718","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel1/12/6095/00237718.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/12.237718","startPage":"769","endPage":"779","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6095","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Numerical accuracy and hardware tradeoffs for CORDIC arithmetic for special-purpose processors","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Numerical accuracy and hardware tradeoffs for CORDIC arithmetic for special-purpose processors","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/237718/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul 1993","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul 1993","volume":"42","issue":"7","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"July 1993","accessionNumber":"4580534","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Numerical accuracy and hardware tradeoffs for CORDIC arithmetic for special-purpose processors","sourcePdf":"00237718.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.04735S","chronDate":"Jul 1993","isNumber":"6095","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"76","articleId":"237718","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":237724,"authors":[{"name":"H.

The impact of multipath fading on synchronizer performance is evaluated by means of computer simulation.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/26.237846","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel1/26/6100/00237846.pdf","startPage":"1296","endPage":"1299","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/26.237846","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6100","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design and analysis of a jitter-free clock recovery scheme for QAM systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=237846","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1993","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1993","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/237846/","displayDocTitle":"Design and analysis of a jitter-free clock recovery scheme for QAM systems","volume":"41","issue":"9","publicationDate":"Sept. 1993","accessionNumber":"4569507","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design and analysis of a jitter-free clock recovery scheme for QAM systems","sourcePdf":"00237846.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.039986S","chronDate":"Sep 1993","isNumber":"6100","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"40","articleId":"237846","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":237848,"authors":[{"name":"N.

The author has developed such capabilities for one-way broadcast media, such as the envisioned terrestrial broadcasting of digital high-definition television signals. In this television broadcasting, the data from video source encoders are not equally important. It is desirable that the important data be recovered by each receiver even under poor receiving conditions. Two approaches for providing such unequal error protection to different classes of data are presented. Power-efficient and bandwidth-efficient coded modulation is used in both approaches. The first approach is based on novel signal constellations with nonuniformly spaced signal points. The second uses time division multiplexing of different conventional coded modulation schemes. Both approaches can provide error protection for the important data to an extent that can hardly be achieved using conventional coded modulation with equal error protection. For modest amounts of important data, the first approach has, additionally, the potential of providing immunity from impulse noise through simple bit or signal-point interleaving.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/26.237878","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel1/26/6101/00237878.pdf","startPage":"1439","endPage":"1449","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/26.237878","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6101","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Coded modulation with unequal error protection","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1993","displayDocTitle":"Coded modulation with unequal error protection","volume":"41","issue":"10","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4587286","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 1993","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/237878/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1993","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Coded modulation with unequal error protection","sourcePdf":"00237878.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.023138S","chronDate":"Oct 1993","isNumber":"6101","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"162","articleId":"237878","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":237879,"authors":[{"name":"Y.S.

L-frequency coding is advantageous over channel coding schemes that achieve implicit time-diversity through trellis coding in conjunction with time-interleaving because it requires negligible end-to-end delay.

A numerical approximation to this upper-bound and the design of a two-state and two four-state, two-frequency codes are presented. Through simulations, it was found that relative to the traditional dual frequency diversity approach, the two-state and four-state codes achieve 3- and 4-dB coding gains, respectively.

Analytically, minimizing the variance of the importance sampling (IS) estimator with respect to the biasing parameters has typically yielded solutions for systems for which the BER could be found analytically. A technique for finding an asymptotically optimal set of biasing parameter values, in the sense that as the resolution of the search and the number of runs used both approach infinity, the algorithm converges to the true optimum, is proposed. The algorithm determines the amount of biasing that minimizes a statistical measure of the variance of the BER estimate and exploits a theoretically justifiable relationship, for small sample sizes, between the BER estimate and the amount of biasing. The translation biasing scheme is considered, although the algorithm is applicable to other parametric IS techniques. Only mild assumptions are required of the noise distribution and system. Experimentally, improvement factors ranging from two to eight orders of magnitude are obtained for a number of distributions for both linear and nonlinear systems with memory.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Monte Carlo methods","Bit error rate","Runtime","Communication systems","Signal processing algorithms","Digital communication","Sampling methods","Analysis of variance","Linear systems","Additive noise"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["digital communication systems","error statistics","Monte Carlo methods","optimisation","parameter estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["linear systems","algorithmic approach","optimization","importance sampling parameters","digital communication system simulation","BER","Monte Carlo simulation","biasing parameters","translation biasing scheme","nonlinear systems"]}],"doi":"10.1109/26.237881","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel1/26/6101/00237881.pdf","startPage":"1464","endPage":"1473","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6101","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/26.237881","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An algorithmic approach to the optimization of importance sampling parameters in digital communication system simulation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=237881","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"An algorithmic approach to the optimization of importance sampling parameters in digital communication system simulation","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/237881/","volume":"41","issue":"10","publicationDate":"Oct. 1993","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4587289","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1993","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1993","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An algorithmic approach to the optimization of importance sampling parameters in digital communication system simulation","sourcePdf":"00237881.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.032739S","chronDate":"Oct 1993","isNumber":"6101","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"45","articleId":"237881","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":237882,"authors":[{"name":"L.

The algorithm first constructs a planar triangulation from locations of all nodes as a starting topology. Then, the minimum angles of all triangles in the planar triangulation are maximized by means of edge switching to improve connectivity and throughput. The resulting triangulation at this stage, the Delaunay triangulation, can be determined locally at each node. The topology is modified by negotiating among neighbors to satisfy a design requirement on the nodal degree parameter. Simulations show that the final topology is degree-bounded, has a rather regular and uniform structure, and has throughput and reliability that are greater than that of a number of alternative topologies.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/26.237882","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel1/26/6101/00237882.pdf","startPage":"1474","endPage":"1481","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/26.237882","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6101","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Topology control for multihop packet radio networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/237882/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1993","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1993","displayDocTitle":"Topology control for multihop packet radio networks","volume":"41","issue":"10","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 1993","accessionNumber":"4587290","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Topology control for multihop packet radio networks","sourcePdf":"00237882.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.063163S","chronDate":"Oct 1993","isNumber":"6101","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"166","articleId":"237882","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":237885,"authors":[{"name":"C.

The proposed algorithm uses the smoothness property of common image signals and produces a maximally smooth image among all those with the same coefficients and boundary conditions. It recovers each damaged block by minimizing the intersample variation within the block and across the block boundary. The optimal solution is achievable through two linear transformations, where the transform matrices depend on the loss pattern and can be calculated in advance. The reconstruction of contiguously damaged blocks is accomplished iteratively using the previous solution as the boundary conditions in each new step. This technique is applicable to any unitary block-transform and is effective for recovering the DC and low-frequency coefficients. When applied to still image coders using the discrete cosine transform (DCT), high quality images are reconstructed in the absence of many DC and low-frequency coefficients over spatially adjacent blocks. When the damaged blocks are isolated by block interleaving, satisfactory results have been obtained even when all the coefficients are missing.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/26.237889","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6101","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/26.237889","endPage":"1551","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel1/26/6101/00237889.pdf","startPage":"1544","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Maximally smooth image recovery in transform coding","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1993","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1993","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/237889/","displayDocTitle":"Maximally smooth image recovery in transform coding","volume":"41","issue":"10","accessionNumber":"4587297","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Oct. 1993","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Maximally smooth image recovery in transform coding","sourcePdf":"00237889.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.054921S","chronDate":"Oct 1993","isNumber":"6101","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"236","articleId":"237889","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":237890,"authors":[{"name":"C.

In particular it is shown that, depending on the implementation, the input queueing approach studied in this paper achieves the same performance as the optimum (output) queueing alternative, without resorting to a faster packet switch fabric.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1993","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/237891/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1993","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4587299","volume":"41","issue":"10","publicationDate":"Oct. 1993","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Performance evaluation of input and output queueing techniques in ATM switching systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance evaluation of input and output queueing techniques in ATM switching systems","sourcePdf":"00237891.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.040315S","chronDate":"Oct 1993","isNumber":"6101","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"27","articleId":"237891","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":237930,"authors":[{"name":"H.D.

The following problems were found to degrade the properties of the modules: (1) Thick wire connections debonded after a low number of cycles because of mechanical strain. (2) Substrate assemblies deformed due to bimetallic effects, leading to poor thermal contact to the heatsink, and in some cases, to a cracking of electrical interconnects. (3) Soldering of substrates to large copper plates was of poor quality. The high number of large voids created intolerable differences in thermal resistance between the paralleled chips. It appears that the packaging technologies used are insufficient for power modules with paralleled chips when a high number of load cycles is expected.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/33.237930","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Components, Hybrids, and Manufacturing Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Components, Hybrids, and Manufacturing Technology","pdfPath":"/iel1/33/6104/00237930.pdf","startPage":"412","endPage":"417","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/33.237930","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6104","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Failure analysis of power modules: a look at the packaging and reliability of large IGBTs","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/237930/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1993","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1993","displayDocTitle":"Failure analysis of power modules: a look at the packaging and reliability of large IGBTs","volume":"16","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"June 1993","accessionNumber":"4536869","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Failure analysis of power modules: a look at the packaging and reliability of large IGBTs","sourcePdf":"00237930.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.041762S","chronDate":"Jun 1993","isNumber":"6104","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"33","citationCount":"48","articleId":"237930","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":237984,"authors":[{"name":"C.

Detection of accurate zero crossings is possible even when there are large frequency changes, sudden load changes, or large commutation overlap angles. The improved accuracy in the integrity of the zero crossing is obtained by reconstructing a voltage representing the AC source voltage. This voltage is determined from the distorted thyristor converter input voltage, the converter input current, and an online identification of the source impedance using a microcontroller-based adaptive algorithm.

A test is obtained by determining signal values that satisfy a Boolean equation derived from the neural network model of the circuit incorporating necessary conditions for fault activation and path sensitization. The algorithm is a sequence of two main steps that are repeatedly executed: transitive closure computation and decision-making. A key feature of the algorithm is that dependences derived from the transitive closure are used to reduce ternary relations to binary relations that in turn dynamically update the transitive closure. The signals are either determined from the transitive closure or are enumerated until the Boolean equation is satisfied.

The weights are computed by walking through the range of test generation approaches from pure random at one extreme to deterministic at the other extreme, dynamically selecting the weight assignments to correspond to the remaining faults at every stage.

The algorithm can be utilized to preprocess a data-flow graph prior to resource scheduling and allocation.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/43.238043","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel1/43/6109/00238043.pdf","startPage":"1063","endPage":"1068","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/43.238043","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6109","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Data-flow transformations for critical path time reduction in high-level DSP synthesis","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=238043","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul 1993","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul 1993","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/238043/","displayDocTitle":"Data-flow transformations for critical path time reduction in high-level DSP synthesis","volume":"12","issue":"7","publicationDate":"July 1993","accessionNumber":"4525183","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Data-flow transformations for critical path time reduction in high-level DSP synthesis","sourcePdf":"00238043.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.029398S","chronDate":"Jul 1993","isNumber":"6109","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","citationCount":"19","articleId":"238043","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":238071,"authors":[{"name":"Z.

It is based on selective launching of lower order modes into the fiber at the transmitting end and on filtering out at the receiver the fraction of the energy that was coupled into the higher order modes throughout the propagation in the multimode fiber. The power penalty and the dispersion performance of the scheme are investigated. In particular, it is shown that the scheme carries about 6.5 dB penalty, and doubling of the bandwidth*distance value is demonstrated. The effect of splices on the performance is also presented. It is envisioned that this approach may be used to upgrade existing multimode systems without the need for rewiring. For example, it can be used to replace the FDDI (fiber distributed data interface) installations in future high-speed networks, when transmission rates increase from megabits per second to gigabits per second.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/50.238071","startPage":"1125","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel1/50/6111/00238071.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/50.238071","endPage":"1131","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6111","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A mode-filtering scheme for improvement of the bandwidth-distance product in multimode fiber systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/238071/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul 1993","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul 1993","displayDocTitle":"A mode-filtering scheme for improvement of the bandwidth-distance product in multimode fiber systems","volume":"11","issue":"7","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4555235","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"July 1993","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A mode-filtering scheme for improvement of the bandwidth-distance product in multimode fiber systems","sourcePdf":"00238071.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.056471S","chronDate":"Jul 1993","isNumber":"6111","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"69","articleId":"238071","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":238074,"authors":[{"name":"K.

Until now, the damping factor of the PLL has been assumed to be 1/ square root 2 when deriving the required spectral linewidth of a light source, because it is at this value that an electrical PLL offers near optimum performance in many cases. By increasing the PLL damping factor above 1/ square root 2, it is shown that there exists a maximum value of the required linewidth that achieves a received optical power penalty of 1 dB at a bit error rate of 10/sup -10/. The required beat linewidths so obtained are 50% larger than previously reported results (which assume a damping factor of 1/ square root 2). As for PLL frequency acquisition performance, it is shown that raising the camping factor above 1/ square root 2 does not seriously affect the hold-in limit or the pull-in limit. It is also shown that the normalized loop gain that optimizes PLL performance is roughly one half the normalized loop gain at which the PLL oscillation commences.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/50.238085","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/50.238085","startPage":"1226","endPage":"1233","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel1/50/6111/00238085.pdf","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6111","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Damping factor influence on linewidth requirements for optical PSK coherent detection systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul 1993","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul 1993","displayDocTitle":"Damping factor influence on linewidth requirements for optical PSK coherent detection systems","publicationDate":"July 1993","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","volume":"11","issue":"7","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4555249","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/238085/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Damping factor influence on linewidth requirements for optical PSK coherent detection systems","sourcePdf":"00238085.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.035854S","chronDate":"Jul 1993","isNumber":"6111","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"12","articleId":"238085","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":238086,"authors":[{"name":"C.M.

II. Simulation results","abstract":"For pt.I see ibid., vol.11, no.7, p.1234-49 (1993). The performance of a DC-coupled fully-differential interconnect is analyzed in terms of the deterministic vertical and horizontal eye closure at Gb/s for different optical power levels and extinction ratios in the two complementary arms. Two types of transmitters are investigated, one based on an ideal optical modulator switch (IOMS) and the other based on conventional modulation of two separate lasers. In general, it is found that the timing jitter increases when the imbalance between the power levels in the two arms increases, when the difference between the laser turn-on delay in the two arms increases, and when the receiver and transmitter bandwidth is reduced. To achieve low latency and to accept a maximum power imbalance of 4-5 dB at the receiver, the IOMS and the lasers should be modulated to produce an extinction ratio of at least 10 dB, and the lasers should be biased above threshold. If low latency is not the main concern, an improvement in the maximum tolerable imbalance can be obtained with regular laser modulation by biasing the lasers below threshold. The fitter can be reduced and the maximum tolerable imbalance be increased if faster receivers and transmitters are employed.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul 1993","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/238086/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul 1993","volume":"11","issue":"7","accessionNumber":"4555251","publicationDate":"July 1993","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Differential board/backplane optical interconnects for high-speed digital systems.

The modem, which can operate under full duplex transmission is based on a direct-sequence/code-shift-keying (DS/CSK) method for the modulation. Pseudonoise (PN) codes are chosen from a preferred pair of m-sequences of period 127, and the code rate is 14 MHz. The demodulation is carried out asynchronously, utilizing the coherent correlation characteristics of the SAW convolver. The main interference caused by a transmitted signal in the modem itself is effectively reduced by an RF isolator and the SS process gain. Adequate self-jamming rejection capability has been confirmed; a bit error rate of 10/sup -6/ is observed at -78.3 dB of a desired-to-undesired-signal ratio using an artificial transmission line.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  1993","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/238098/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  1993","volume":"40","issue":"5","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 1993","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4556426","pubMedId":"18263209","displayDocTitle":"Full duplex transmission operation of a 2.45-GHz asynchronous spread spectrum using a SAN convolver","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Full duplex transmission operation of a 2.45-GHz asynchronous spread spectrum using a SAN convolver","sourcePdf":"00238098.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.057729S","chronDate":"Sept.  1993","isNumber":"6112","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"58","citationCount":"31","articleId":"238098","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":238101,"authors":[{"name":"A.J.

The RF testbed is described and characterized for system distortion, dynamic range, and spurious responses, and system optimization is discussed. Nine different SAW modulator filters having different time- and frequency-domain responses were designed and fabricated for use in the system. Several of the designs are representative of new modulation schemes which offer better spectral confinement; and time-domain envelope uniformity than MSK. The results obtained with the designed SAW quadrature binary modulation system are presented. Excellent agreement between time- and frequency-domain measurements and theoretical predictions using the SAW modulation system are shown.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/58.238101","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/58.238101","startPage":"496","endPage":"503","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","pdfPath":"/iel1/58/6112/00238101.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6112","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"SAW quadrature binary modulation system applications","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  1993","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  1993","displayDocTitle":"SAW quadrature binary modulation system applications","publicationDate":"Sept. 1993","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","volume":"40","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4556429","pubMedId":"18263212","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/238101/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"SAW quadrature binary modulation system applications","sourcePdf":"00238101.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.029154S","chronDate":"Sept.  1993","isNumber":"6112","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"58","citationCount":"5","articleId":"238101","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":238115,"authors":[{"name":"F.S.

UBM is essentially an extension of the powerful B-mode backscatter methods developed for clinical imaging in the 3-10-MHz frequency range. The development of new high sensitivity transducers in the 40-100-MHz range now permits visualization of tissue structures with resolution approaching 20 mu m and a maximum penetration of approximately 4 mm. The performance characteristics and trade-offs of these new polymer and ceramic devices are reviewed, and the implementation of high-frequency imaging systems is described. Initial clinical applications of UBM include ophthalmic, skin, and intravascular imaging. Examples of images and progress in these areas are presented. The biological application of UBM is illustrated by studies of drug uptake in living tumor spheroids. Significant increases in backscatter levels resulting from drugs targeting oxic and hypoxic cell populations are demonstrated.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/58.238115","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","pdfPath":"/iel1/58/6112/00238115.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/58.238115","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6112","startPage":"608","endPage":"617","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Principles and applications of ultrasound backscatter microscopy","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=238115","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Principles and applications of ultrasound backscatter microscopy","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  1993","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/238115/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  1993","isJournal":true,"volume":"40","issue":"5","publicationDate":"Sept. 1993","accessionNumber":"4556443","pubMedId":"18263226","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Principles and applications of ultrasound backscatter microscopy","sourcePdf":"00238115.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.047339S","chronDate":"Sept.  1993","isNumber":"6112","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"58","citationCount":"172","articleId":"238115","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-20"},{"_id":238150,"authors":[{"name":"L.

The amplified output was focused to a single lobe by the monolithically integrated aspheric waveguide lens, which may be useful for efficient coupling of the output into a single-mode fiber.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/68.238253","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/68.238253","startPage":"916","endPage":"919","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Photonics Technology Letters","pdfPath":"/iel3/68/6118/00238253.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Photonics Technology Letters","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6118","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multiple-quantum-well GaInAs/GaInAsP tapered broad-area amplifiers with monolithically integrated waveguide lens for high-power applications","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug.  1993","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  1993","displayDocTitle":"Multiple-quantum-well GaInAs/GaInAsP tapered broad-area amplifiers with monolithically integrated waveguide lens for high-power applications","publicationDate":"Aug. 1993","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","volume":"5","issue":"8","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4582448","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/238253/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multiple-quantum-well GaInAs/GaInAsP tapered broad-area amplifiers with monolithically integrated waveguide lens for high-power applications","sourcePdf":"00238253.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.033946S","chronDate":"Aug.  1993","isNumber":"6118","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"68","citationCount":"32","articleId":"238253","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Letter","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":238255,"authors":[{"name":"D.C.

The interplay of hand-eye coordination in dynamic grasping tasks such as grasping of parts on a moving conveyor system, assembly of articulated parts, or for grasping from a mobile robotic system is explored. The goal is to build an integrated sensing and actuation system that can operate in dynamic as opposed to static environments. The system built addresses three distinct problems in using robotic hand-eye coordination for grasping moving objects: fast computation of 3-D motion parameters from vision, predictive control of a moving robotic arm to track a moving object, and interception and grasping. The system operates at approximately human arm movement rates. Experimental results in which a moving model train is tracked, stably grasped, and picked up by the system are presented. The algorithms developed to relate sensing to actuation are quite general and applicable to a variety of complex robotic tasks.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1993","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/238279/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1993","volume":"9","issue":"2","accessionNumber":"4527362","publicationDate":"April 1993","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Automated tracking and grasping of a moving object with a robotic hand-eye system","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Automated tracking and grasping of a moving object with a robotic hand-eye system","sourcePdf":"00238279.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.036565S","chronDate":"Apr 1993","isNumber":"6119","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"70","citationCount":"307","articleId":"238279","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":238280,"authors":[{"name":"R.S.

The design is a modification of the Stewart platform that places the legs of the manipulator on two concentric circles both at the base and at the end effector. The legs can therefore cross over one another in space without interference, which allows them to move closer to the horizontal. This brings the force/torque and velocity capacities in different directions more into balance. The degree of improvement attainable is quantified by defining a measure of dexterity as the average condition number of the Jacobian matrix over a centralized subregion of the workspace, and optimizing the manipulator design with respect to a weighted sum of dexterity and workspace volume. This measure of dexterity is compared with other measures on the basis of the singular values of the Jacobian. It is shown that the new design offers significantly improved dexterity over the traditional Stewart platform design.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/70.238280","startPage":"166","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Robotics and Automation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Robotics and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel4/70/6119/00238280.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/70.238280","endPage":"173","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6119","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A modified Stewart platform manipulator with improved dexterity","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/238280/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1993","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1993","displayDocTitle":"A modified Stewart platform manipulator with improved dexterity","volume":"9","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4527363","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"April 1993","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A modified Stewart platform manipulator with improved dexterity","sourcePdf":"00238280.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.028922S","chronDate":"Apr 1993","isNumber":"6119","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"70","citationCount":"152","articleId":"238280","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":238284,"authors":[{"name":"C.-Y.

The major contribution of this methodology lies in the use of a special matrix, called the regressor, which makes it possible to isolate the unknown parameters from the robotic dynamics. Based on the upper bounds of those unknown parameters, which are estimated by a simple adaptive law, the proposed VSS (variable-structure-system) controller guarantees the stability of the closed-loop system. The robustness analysis shows that in the presence of the uncertainties, which are assumed to be unbounded and rapidly varying, the closed-loop system can still be stabilized. Chattering is reduced by using the boundary layer technique. Simulation results show the validity of the proposed algorithm.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/70.238284","startPage":"208","endPage":"214","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Robotics and Automation","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/70.238284","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6119","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Robotics and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel4/70/6119/00238284.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A sliding mode controller with bound estimation for robot manipulators","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/238284/","displayDocTitle":"A sliding mode controller with bound estimation for robot manipulators","volume":"9","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4527367","publicationDate":"April 1993","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1993","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1993","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A sliding mode controller with bound estimation for robot manipulators","sourcePdf":"00238284.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.050479S","chronDate":"Apr 1993","isNumber":"6119","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"70","citationCount":"102","articleId":"238284","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":238286,"authors":[{"name":"T.

Raibert and J.J. Craig (1981). One difficulty in implementing the method is that precise information on the size and position of the object with which the end-effector contacts is not usually available. To cope with this difficulty, a problem of dynamic hybrid control with unknown constraint is studied. An online algorithm is developed that estimates the local shape of the constraint surface by using measured data on the position and force of the end-effector. It is shown by experiments, using a SCARA-type robot, that the combination of this algorithm with the dynamic hybrid control method works fairly well, making the dynamic hybrid control approach more practical.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/238286/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1993","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1993","publicationDate":"April 1993","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4527369","volume":"9","issue":"2","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Dynamic hybrid position/force control of robot manipulators-on-line estimation of unknown constraint","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamic hybrid position/force control of robot manipulators-on-line estimation of unknown constraint","sourcePdf":"00238286.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.030302S","chronDate":"Apr 1993","isNumber":"6119","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"70","citationCount":"92","articleId":"238286","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":238287,"authors":[{"name":"J.-H.

As a result, some of the tasks on an overloaded node may miss their deadlines even if the overall system has the capacity to meet the deadlines of all tasks. A decentralized, dynamic load sharing (LS) scheme has been proposed as a solution to this problem. Analytic queuing models to comparatively evaluate this LS scheme as well as three other schemes-no LS, LS with random selection of a receiver node, and LS with perfect information- are developed. The evolution of a node's load state is modeled as a continuous-time semi-Markov process, where cumulative execution time (CET), rather than the commonly-used queue length (QL), is employed to describe the workload of a node. The proposed scheme is compared against other LS schemes. The validity of analytic models is checked with simulations. Both analytic and simulation results indicate that by using judicious exchange/use of state information and Bayesian decision mechanism, the proposed scheme makes a significant improvement over other existing LS schemes in minimizing the probability of dynamic failure.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","pdfPath":"/iel4/71/6120/00238298.pdf","startPage":"740","endPage":"761","doi":"10.1109/71.238298","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/71.238298","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6120","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analytic models of adaptive load sharing schemes in distributed real-time systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/238298/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul 1993","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul 1993","displayDocTitle":"Analytic models of adaptive load sharing schemes in distributed real-time systems","publicationDate":"July 1993","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4557061","isJournal":true,"volume":"4","issue":"7","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analytic models of adaptive load sharing schemes in distributed real-time systems","sourcePdf":"00238298.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.042962S","chronDate":"Jul 1993","isNumber":"6120","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"71","citationCount":"21","articleId":"238298","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":238299,"authors":[{"name":"D.M.

The impact and interaction of these two families of methods with Kohonen's self-organizing feature mapping (SOFM), which is not a clustering method but often lends ideas to clustering algorithms, are considered. A generalization of LVQ that updates all nodes for a given input vector is proposed. The network attempts to find a minimum of a well-defined objective function. The learning rules depend on the degree of distance match to the winner node; the lesser the degree of match with the winner, the greater the impact on nonwinner nodes.

This algorithm exhibits good performance in reaching the optimum minimization of a cost function for vector quantization data compression. The soft-max rule employed is an extension of the standard K-means clustering procedure and takes into account a neighborhood ranking of the reference (weight) vectors. It is shown that the dynamics of the reference (weight) vectors during the input-driven adaptation procedure are determined by the gradient of an energy function whose shape can be modulated through a neighborhood determining parameter and resemble the dynamics of Brownian particles moving in a potential determined by the data point density. The network is used to represent the attractor of the Mackey-Glass equation and to predict the Mackey-Glass time series, with additional local linear mappings for generating output values. The results obtained for the time-series prediction compare favorably with the results achieved by backpropagation and radial basis function networks.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel4/72/6121/00238311.pdf","startPage":"558","endPage":"569","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","doi":"10.1109/72.238311","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/72.238311","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6121","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=238311","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"'Neural-gas' network for vector quantization and its application to time-series prediction","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Vector quantization","Clustering algorithms","Neural networks","Minimization methods","Cost function","Data compression","Shape","Equations","Backpropagation","Radial basis function networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data compression","minimisation","neural nets","time series","vector quantisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Brownian motion","vector quantization","time-series prediction","neural network","soft-max adaptation rule","minimization","cost function","data compression","K-means clustering","neighborhood ranking","data point density","Mackey-Glass equation","local linear mappings"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/238311/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  1993","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"July  1993","displayDocTitle":"'Neural-gas' network for vector quantization and its application to time-series prediction","volume":"4","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"July 1993","accessionNumber":"4551391","pubMedId":"18267757","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"'Neural-gas' network for vector quantization and its application to time-series prediction","sourcePdf":"00238311.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.036514S","chronDate":"July  1993","isNumber":"6121","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"72","citationCount":"1007","articleId":"238311","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-28"},{"_id":238312,"authors":[{"name":"S.

This procedure uses a number of prototypes of known class and identifies an unknown pattern vector according to the prototype it is nearest to. A recall criterion of this type that depends on the relation of the unknown to a single prototype is a non-smooth function and leads to a decision boundary that is a jagged, piecewise linear hypersurface. Collective recall, a pattern recognition method based on a smooth nearness measure of the unknown to all the prototypes, is developed. The prototypes are represented as cells in a brain-state-in-a-box (BSB) network. Cells that represent the same pattern class are linked by positive weights and cells representing different pattern classes are linked by negative weights. Computer simulations of collective recall used in conjunction with learning vector quantization (LVQ) show significant improvement in performance relative to nearest neighbor recall for pattern classes defined by nonspherically symmetric Gaussians.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/72.238313","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6121","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/72.238313","endPage":"587","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel4/72/6121/00238313.pdf","startPage":"580","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Collective recall via the brain-state-in-a-box network","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"July  1993","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  1993","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/238313/","displayDocTitle":"Collective recall via the brain-state-in-a-box network","volume":"4","issue":"4","accessionNumber":"4551393","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","pubMedId":"18267759","publicationDate":"July 1993","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Collective recall via the brain-state-in-a-box network","sourcePdf":"00238313.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.049075S","chronDate":"July  1993","isNumber":"6121","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"72","citationCount":"23","articleId":"238313","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":238314,"authors":[{"name":"B.W.

Hardware annealing, which combines the simulated annealing technique with continuous-time electronic neural networks by changing the voltage gain of neurons, is discussed. The initial and final voltage gains for applying hardware annealing to Hopfield data-conversion networks are presented. In hardware annealing, the voltage gain of output neurons is increased from an initial low value to a final high value in a continuous fashion which helps to achieve the optimal solution for an optimization problem in one annealing cycle.

The design of the system is based on the fact that system adaptability is a key to its effectiveness and efficiency. A composite source data model is suggested as a mathematical model for image data. Based on the composite source model, the coding system first classifies image data and then transforms and codes data classes with dedicated schemes. LEP, a reliable learning neural network model that uses experiences and perspectives, is proposed for image data classification using textures. A scheme for learning Karhunen-Loeve (K-L) transform basis arranged in the descent order with respect to eigenvalues in a two-layer linear-forward network is developed. These two learning mechanisms serve as essential parts of the coding system and enhance the adaptability of the system considerably.

The experimental results show that RPCL outperforms FSCL when used for unsupervised classification, for training a radial basis function (RBF) network, and for curve detection in digital images.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/72.238318","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","startPage":"636","endPage":"649","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel4/72/6121/00238318.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/72.238318","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6121","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Rival penalized competitive learning for clustering analysis, RBF net, and curve detection","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Clustering algorithms","Signal processing algorithms","Algorithm design and analysis","Power capacitors","Subspace constraints","Image coding","Digital images","Pattern analysis","Data analysis","Pattern recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image recognition","neural nets","unsupervised learning"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["radial basis function network","neural nets","clustering analysis","curve detection","competitive learning","rival penalized competitive learning","Kohonen's supervised LVQ2","unsupervised classification","digital images"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"July  1993","displayDocTitle":"Rival penalized competitive learning for clustering analysis, RBF net, and curve detection","volume":"4","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4551398","pubMedId":"18267764","publicationDate":"July 1993","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  1993","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/238318/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Rival penalized competitive learning for clustering analysis, RBF net, and curve detection","sourcePdf":"00238318.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.046685S","chronDate":"July  1993","isNumber":"6121","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"72","citationCount":"487","articleId":"238318","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":238319,"authors":[{"name":"V.

The implementation takes advantage of the fact that one ART-based architecture, known as ART1, can be broken into several parts, some of which are better to implement in parallel. The control structure of ART, often regarded as its most complex part, is actually not very time consuming and can be done in electronics. The bottom-up and top-down gated pathways, however, are very time consuming to simulate and are difficult to implement directly in electronics due to the high number of interconnections. In addition to the design, the authors present experiments with a laboratory prototype to illustrate its feasibility and to discuss implementation details that arise in practice. This device can potentially outperform alternative implementations of ART1 by as much as two to three orders of magnitude in problems requiring especially large input fields.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/72.238321","startPage":"673","endPage":"684","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel4/72/6121/00238321.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/72.238321","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6121","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An optoelectronic implementation of the adaptive resonance neural network","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Adaptive systems","Resonance","Neural networks","Subspace constraints","Optical filters","Correlators","Laboratories","Hardware","Optical computing","Computational modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optical correlation","optical neural nets","optoelectronic devices","pattern recognition","spatial filters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optoelectronic implementation","adaptive resonance neural network","adaptive resonance theory","ART","optical correlator","ART1"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/238321/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"July  1993","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  1993","displayDocTitle":"An optoelectronic implementation of the adaptive resonance neural network","volume":"4","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"July 1993","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4551401","pubMedId":"18267767","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An optoelectronic implementation of the adaptive resonance neural network","sourcePdf":"00238321.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.09025S","chronDate":"July  1993","isNumber":"6121","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"72","citationCount":"26","articleId":"238321","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-10"},{"_id":238322,"authors":[{"name":"R.E.

Lyapunov stability techniques, usually applied to adaptive systems, are used to derive a globally asymptotically stable adaptation law for a single-layer neural network controller that bears similarities to the well-known delta rule for neural networks. This alternative learning rule allows the learning rates of each connection weight to be individually adjusted to give faster convergence. The role of persistently exciting inputs in ensuring parameter convergence, often mentioned in the context of adaptive systems, is emphasized in relation to the convergence of neural network weights. A coupled, compound pendulum system is used to develop inverse dynamics controllers based on adaptive and neural network techniques. Adaptation performance is compared for a model-based adaptive controller and a simple neural network utilizing both delta-rule learning and the alternative adaptation law.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  1993","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/238322/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"July  1993","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4551402","pubMedId":"18267768","volume":"4","issue":"4","publicationDate":"July 1993","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"An analytical comparison of a neural network and a model-based adaptive controller","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An analytical comparison of a neural network and a model-based adaptive controller","sourcePdf":"00238322.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.030759S","chronDate":"July  1993","isNumber":"6121","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"72","citationCount":"39","articleId":"238322","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":238343,"authors":[{"name":"T.

A design method based on a recently developed weighted-least-squares (WLS) algorithm is presented. First, FIR filters with continuous coefficients are designed, using the WLS algorithm to meet the desired frequency response specifications in the minimax sense. To avoid the effect of a nonuniformly distributed coefficient grid due to discretization of filter coefficients, a procedure is then performed to obtain an optimal filter gain factor. Finally, utilizing the error weighting function obtained by the WLS algorithm, an efficient discrete optimization process is performed to obtain a discrete solution in the minimax sense. The efficiency of the method is illustrated by the design of discrete-coefficient FIR filters with constant group delay and filter length greater than 60.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Analog and Digital Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/82/6124/00238373.pdf","startPage":"444","endPage":"448","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Analog and Digital Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/82.238373","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/82.238373","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6124","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=238373","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design of discrete coefficient FIR digital filters with arbitrary amplitude and phase responses","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Finite impulse response filter","Digital filters","Minimax techniques","Least squares methods","Frequency response","Least squares approximation","Frequency domain analysis","Design methodology","Algorithm design and analysis","Performance gain"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["digital filters","filtering and prediction theory","frequency response","optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["amplitude response","discrete coefficient","FIR digital filters","phase responses","complex frequency domain","design method","weighted-least-squares","WLS algorithm","frequency response specifications","optimal filter gain factor","error weighting function","discrete optimization process","constant group delay"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/238373/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul 1993","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul 1993","displayDocTitle":"Design of discrete coefficient FIR digital filters with arbitrary amplitude and phase responses","volume":"40","issue":"7","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"July 1993","accessionNumber":"4573169","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design of discrete coefficient FIR digital filters with arbitrary amplitude and phase responses","sourcePdf":"00238373.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.039634S","chronDate":"Jul 1993","isNumber":"6124","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"82","citationCount":"18","articleId":"238373","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":238389,"authors":[{"name":"J. von Neumann","firstName":"J.","lastName":"von Neumann"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1058-6180"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1934-1547"}],"articleNumber":"238389","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":233,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":2712},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computer Society","url":"http://www.computer.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Laboratories","History","Forward contracts","Proposals","Mathematics","Physics computing","Engines","Pain","Electrical engineering","Statistics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["digital computers","history"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["history","EDVAC","automatic computing engine","general-purpose digital computer"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=238389","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Annals of the History of Computing","pdfPath":"/iel4/85/6125/00238389.pdf","startPage":"27","endPage":"75","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/85.238389","doi":"10.1109/85.238389","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6125","publicationTitle":"IEEE Annals of the History of Computing","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"First draft of a report on the EDVAC","abstract":"The first draft of a report on the EDVAC written by John von Neumann is presented.

This controller utilizes a learning mechanism that observes the plant outputs and adjusts the rules in a direct fuzzy controller so that the overall system behaves like a reference model characterizing the desired behavior. The performance of the FMRLC-based ABS is demonstrated by simulation for various road conditions (wet asphalt, icy) and transitions between such conditions (e.g. when emergency braking occurs and the road switches from wet to icy or vice versa).<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fuzzy control","Fuzzy systems","Control systems","Roads","Degradation","Learning systems","Asphalt","Feedback","Switches","Automotive engineering"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["automobiles","fuzzy control","intelligent control","learning systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["automobiles","fuzzy learning control","antiskid braking systems","steerability","fuzzy model reference learning control","learning mechanism"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6126","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/87.238405","startPage":"122","endPage":"129","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Control Systems Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Control Systems Technology","pdfPath":"/iel4/87/6126/00238405.pdf","doi":"10.1109/87.238405","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fuzzy learning control for antiskid braking systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1993","displayDocTitle":"Fuzzy learning control for antiskid braking systems","accessionNumber":"4517759","publicationDate":"June 1993","volume":"1","issue":"2","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/238405/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1993","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fuzzy learning control for antiskid braking systems","sourcePdf":"00238405.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.032218S","chronDate":"Jun 1993","isNumber":"6126","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"87","citationCount":"139","articleId":"238405","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-21"},{"_id":238413,"authors":[{"name":"S.-Y.

It consumes less hardware than a single-level odd-even sorter and reduces the wire complexity of the bitonic sorter in VLSI or WSI (wafer-scale integration) implementation. The optimal number of levels in the hierarchy is evaluated, and the sorting capability of each level is derived so as to minimize the hardware overhead. The hierarchical sorting network is very regular in structure and hence defect tolerance capability can be included more easily than in any existing sorting network with the same time complexity. Redundancy is provided at every level of the hierarchy. Hierarchical reconfiguration is performed by replacing the defective cells at the bottom level with the spare cells first and repeating the process at the next higher level if there is not enough redundancy at the current level.

In the one-dimensional folded architecture, the computations of all wavelet levels are folded to the same low-pass and high-pass filters. The number of registers in the folded architecture is minimized by the use of a generalized life time analysis. The converter units are synthesized with a minimum number of registers using forward-backward allocation. The advantage of the folded architecture is low latency and its drawbacks are increased hardware area, less than 100% hardware utilization, and the complex routing and interconnection required by the converters used. These drawbacks are eliminated in the alternate digit-serial architecture at the expense of an increase in the system latency and some constraints on the wordlength. In latency-critical applications, the use of the folded architecture is suggested. If latency is not so critical, the digit-serial architecture should be used.

Logic and interconnect are separated to achieve optimum FPGA utilization. Its interconnection architecture, called the partial crossbar, greatly reduces system-level placement and routing complexity, achieves bounded interconnect delay, scales linearly with pin count, and allows hierarchical expansion to systems with hundreds of thousands of FPGA devices in a fast and uniform way. An actual multiboard system has been built, using 42 Xilinx XC3090 FPGAs for logic. Several designs, including a 32-b CPU datapath, have been automatically realized and operated at speed. They demonstrate very good FPGA utilization. The Realizer has applications in logic verification and prototyping, simulation, architecture development, and special-purpose execution.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/92.238418","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6127","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/92.238418","endPage":"174","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","pdfPath":"/iel4/92/6127/00238418.pdf","startPage":"171","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An efficient logic emulation system","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"June  1993","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  1993","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/238418/","displayDocTitle":"An efficient logic emulation system","volume":"1","issue":"2","accessionNumber":"4508060","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"June 1993","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An efficient logic emulation system","sourcePdf":"00238418.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.032221S","chronDate":"June  1993","isNumber":"6127","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"73","articleId":"238418","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":238420,"authors":[{"name":"P.E.

The derived distribution can give the probability that a combinational circuit will achieve a certain performance, across the possible range. This information can then be used to predict the expected performance of the entire circuit. The techniques presented target fast analysis as well as reduced memory requirements. The notion of a correct approximation, based on convex inequality, which never overestimates the percentage of circuits that will achieve any given performance is defined. It is shown that given the assumption that all the topologically longest paths are responsible for the delay, the computation technique provides a correct probabilistic measure in the sense given above. Methods are given to identify and to ignore false paths in the probabilistic analysis, so as to obtain correct and less pessimistic answers to the performance prediction question.

The circuits are comparable in quality to results achieved by synthesis starting at the register-transfer-level.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/92.238438","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","pdfPath":"/iel4/92/6128/00238438.pdf","startPage":"244","endPage":"253","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/92.238438","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6128","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The Siemens high-level synthesis system CALLAS","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  1993","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/238438/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  1993","displayDocTitle":"The Siemens high-level synthesis system CALLAS","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4647456","volume":"1","issue":"3","publicationDate":"Sept. 1993","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Siemens high-level synthesis system CALLAS","sourcePdf":"00238438.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.06525S","chronDate":"Sept.  1993","isNumber":"6128","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"35","articleId":"238438","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":238445,"authors":[{"name":"F.H.M.

Handling the M-D nature of data in an efficient way is crucial to arrive at acceptable system implementations. This aspect of design has often been ignored up to now in high-level synthesis. In this paper, a polyhedral based model is presented for the linear, piecewise linear and data dependent signal indexing as occurring in practical M-D signal processing applications. The model features a mathematical description of dependencies between individual operations and signal instances of M-D signals for all algorithms that contain signal indexing specified by a mixture of indexing by iterators and M-D signals embedded in the data flow. The exact modeling of M-D signal indexing is especially essential for deriving alternative control flow structures for a given data flow specification. Exploration of various control flow structures allows one to arrive at an efficient large-scale memory organization during high level synthesis of architectures, both in terms of storage locations and access order.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/92.238445","startPage":"319","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","pdfPath":"/iel4/92/6128/00238445.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/92.238445","endPage":"327","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6128","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Modeling multidimensional data and control flow","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/238445/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  1993","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  1993","displayDocTitle":"Modeling multidimensional data and control flow","volume":"1","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4647463","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Sept. 1993","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modeling multidimensional data and control flow","sourcePdf":"00238445.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.069465S","chronDate":"Sept.  1993","isNumber":"6128","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"28","articleId":"238445","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":238449,"authors":[{"name":"Hyunchul Shin","affiliation":["Department of Electronics Engineering, Hanyang University, South Korea"],"lastName":"Hyunchul Shin","id":"37271406100"},{"name":"Chunghee Kim","affiliation":["Department of Electronics Engineering, Hanyang University, South Korea"],"lastName":"Chunghee Kim","id":"37350578400"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-8210"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9999"}],"articleNumber":"238449","dbTime":"15 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":36,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":88},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Circuits and Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieee-cas.org/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computer Society","url":"http://www.computer.org/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Solid-State Circuits Society","url":"http://www.sscs.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Partitioning algorithms","Iterative algorithms","Cost function","Circuits","Clustering algorithms","Annealing","Very large scale integration","NP-hard problem","Heuristic algorithms","Pins"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["circuit layout CAD","network topology","VLSI"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["partitioning","top-down design","clustering","closely connected cells","size-constraints","gradual constraint enforcement technique","local minimum problems","near optimum solution","crossing nets","network topology","circuit layout","VLSI"]}],"abstract":"Partitioning is an important step in the top-down design of large complicated integrated circuits. In this paper, a simple yet effective partitioning technique is described. It is based on the clustering of \"closely\" connected cells and the gradual enforcement of size-constraints. At the beginning, clusters are formed in the bottom-up fashion to reduce the problem size. Then the clusters are partitioned using several different parameters to find a good starting point. The best result achieved during the cluster partitioning is used as the initial solution for the lower level partitioning. The gradual constraint enforcement technique is used to cope with the local minimum problems. It allows cells or clusters to move with more freedom among the subsets during earlier iterations and thus may effectively find a near optimum solution. Several experimental results show that the new partitioning technique produces favorable results. In particular, the method outperforms the F&M method by more than 60% in the number of crossing nets on average.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/92.238449","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","pdfPath":"/iel4/92/6128/00238449.pdf","startPage":"380","endPage":"386","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/92.238449","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6128","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A simple yet effective technique for partitioning","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=238449","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  1993","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  1993","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/238449/","displayDocTitle":"A simple yet effective technique for partitioning","volume":"1","issue":"3","publicationDate":"Sept. 1993","accessionNumber":"4647468","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A simple yet effective technique for partitioning","sourcePdf":"00238449.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.032552S","chronDate":"Sept.  1993","isNumber":"6128","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"36","articleId":"238449","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":238465,"authors":[{"name":"Y.

Electrical signals were measured using microelectrode array substrates. A novel cell positioning technique was combined with a method for controlling neurite outgrowth, which allowed cell-electrode contacts to be established easily, thus facilitating the electrical recording. Intracellular calcium was measured optically using the indicator fluo-3. Under low-magnesium conditions, cultured rat cortical neurons showed periodic transients of fluo-3 fluorescence, which were synchronized with the periodic bursting observed electrically. The intervals between bursts could be determined by electrical stimulation through the substrate electrodes.

The design methodology is based on the Gaussian beam approach and the structures are optimized for achieving maximum fundamental Gaussian coupling efficiency. For this purpose, a hybrid technique is used in which the integrated part of the antennas is treated using full-wave analysis, whereas the machined part is treated using an approximate model. This results in a simple and efficient design process. The design procedure has been applied to the design of 20-, 23-, and 25-dB quasi-integrated horn antennas, all with a Gaussian coupling efficiency exceeding 97%. The designed antennas have been tested and characterized using both full-wave analysis and 91/370-GHz measurements. The quasi-integrated horn antennas are also examined as feed elements for Cassegrain antenna systems and are proved to be comparable to the traditional machined corrugated horn feeds.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/238509/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun/Jul 1993","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun/Jul 1993","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"June-July 1993","accessionNumber":"4580460","volume":"41","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Design and analysis of quasi-integrated horn antennas for millimeter and submillimeter-wave applications","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design and analysis of quasi-integrated horn antennas for millimeter and submillimeter-wave applications","sourcePdf":"00238509.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.051465S","chronDate":"Jun/Jul 1993","isNumber":"6131","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"19","articleId":"238509","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":238513,"authors":[{"name":"M.

Insertion of an ideal circulator and isolators at the interface ports enables one to calculate the Nyquist plots and voltage distributions of possible instabilities using commercially available linear circuit simulators.

One is a balanced design using 3-dB Lange couplers, and the other is a feedback design using a series RLC parallel feedback network. The gain flatness over the 8-18-GHz frequency band was maintained for both amplifiers at room and cyrogenic temperatures, indicating that the topology for wideband designs is insensitive to temperature of operation. As the physical temperature decreased from 297 K to below 20 K, the balanced LNA exhibited an average gain increase of 2 dB and as much as an eightfold reduction of noise temperature to 20 K, while the feedback LNA exhibited an average gain increase of less than 1 dB and an average foufold reduction of noise temperature to 50 K. The negative feedback network of the feedback LNA resulted in less gain increase and less noise temperature reduction at cryogenic temperatures.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cryogenics","Wideband","PHEMTs","MMICs","Temperature","Noise reduction","Negative feedback","Microwave integrated circuits","Monolithic integrated circuits","Low-noise amplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cryogenics","equivalent circuits","feedback","field effect integrated circuits","gallium arsenide","high electron mobility transistors","III-V semiconductors","indium compounds","microwave amplifiers","MMIC","semiconductor device models","semiconductor device noise","wideband amplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["SHF","pseudomorphic HEMT","MMIC","low-noise amplifiers","wideband","single-stage","monolithic microwave integrated circuit","T-gate","high-electron-mobility transistor","room temperature operation","cryogenic temperatures","balanced design","3-dB Lange couplers","feedback design","series RLC parallel feedback network","balanced LNA","gain increase","noise temperature","feedback LNA","negative feedback network","8 to 18 GHz","0.2 micron","20 to 297 K","InGaAs"]}],"doi":"10.1109/22.238514","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel1/22/6131/00238514.pdf","startPage":"992","endPage":"997","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6131","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/22.238514","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cryogenic characteristics of wide-band pseudomorphic HEMT MMIC low-noise amplifiers","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=238514","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Cryogenic characteristics of wide-band pseudomorphic HEMT MMIC low-noise amplifiers","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/238514/","volume":"41","issue":"6","publicationDate":"June-July 1993","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4580465","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun/Jul 1993","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun/Jul 1993","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cryogenic characteristics of wide-band pseudomorphic HEMT MMIC low-noise amplifiers","sourcePdf":"00238514.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.05946S","chronDate":"Jun/Jul 1993","isNumber":"6131","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"10","articleId":"238514","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":238516,"authors":[{"name":"Y.

A previously developed frequency-dependent finite-difference-time domain (FDTD) formulation has been used to estimate the effect that solid state plasmas have on the resonant frequency on dielectric resonators. Optical generation of plasmas in contact with dielectric resonators is being considered here as a possible means of controlling the resonator's frequency. The effect that carrier diffusion and recombination-generation have on plasma permittivity and penetration depth are taken into account in this analysis. The results are compared with measurement and are shown to yield a quantitative estimate of the optically induced dielectric resonator frequency shift as a function of the illumination, properties of the plasma host semiconductor, and the properties of the dielectric resonator.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/22.238516","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel1/22/6131/00238516.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/22.238516","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6131","startPage":"1005","endPage":"1010","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Frequency-dependent FDTD modeling of optically controlled dielectric resonators","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=238516","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Frequency-dependent FDTD modeling of optically controlled dielectric resonators","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun/Jul 1993","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/238516/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun/Jul 1993","isJournal":true,"volume":"41","issue":"6","publicationDate":"June-July 1993","accessionNumber":"4580467","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Frequency-dependent FDTD modeling of optically controlled dielectric resonators","sourcePdf":"00238516.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.05826S","chronDate":"Jun/Jul 1993","isNumber":"6131","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"14","articleId":"238516","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":238519,"authors":[{"name":"E.

Given a predefined set of N/sub m/ available materials with frequency-dependent permittivities in /sub i/(f) and permeabilities mu /sub i/(f) (i=1,. . ., N/sub m/), the technique determines simultaneously the optimal material choice for each layer and its thickness. This optimal choice results in a screen which maximally absorbs TM and TE incident plane waves for a prescribed range of frequencies (f/sub 1/,f/sub 2/,. . ., f/sub N/f) and incident angles ( theta /sub 1/, theta /sub 2/,. . ., theta /sub N theta /). The synthesis technique is based on a genetic algorithm. The technique automatically places an upper bound on the total thickness of the coating, as well as the number of layers contained in it, which greatly simplifies manufacturing. In addition, the thickness or surface mass of the coating can be minimized simultaneously with the reflection coefficient. The algorithm was successfully applied to the synthesis of wideband absorbing coatings in the frequency ranges of 0.2-2 GHz and 2-8 GHz.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/22.238519","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6131","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/22.238519","endPage":"1031","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel1/22/6131/00238519.pdf","startPage":"1024","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design of lightweight, broad-band microwave absorbers using genetic algorithms","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun/Jul 1993","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun/Jul 1993","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/238519/","displayDocTitle":"Design of lightweight, broad-band microwave absorbers using genetic algorithms","volume":"41","issue":"6","accessionNumber":"4580470","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"June-July 1993","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design of lightweight, broad-band microwave absorbers using genetic algorithms","sourcePdf":"00238519.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.045424S","chronDate":"Jun/Jul 1993","isNumber":"6131","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"437","articleId":"238519","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":238540,"authors":[{"name":"D.R.

This method has four major features: (1) the ability to treat a wide range of dielectric waveguide problems with arbitrarily shaped cross section, inhomogeneity, transverse-anisotropy, and significant loss (or gain); (2) total elimination of spurious solutions; (3) direct solution for the (complex) propagation constant at a specified frequency; and (4) the use of only two components of the magnetic field, thus maximizing the numerical efficiency of solution. The resultant matrix eigenvalue problem is of canonical form and is solved with an efficient method, specially developed for this purpose, taking full advantage of the sparsity of the matrices. Numerical results are shown for a variety of microwave and optical waveguides including anisotropy and losses. These examples also include closed and open structures.

To satisfy these two requirements, the Volcano query execution engine combines the efficient use of parallelism on a wide variety of computer architectures with an extensible set of query processing operators that can be nested into arbitrarily complex query evaluation plans. Volcano's novel exchange operator permits designing, developing, debugging, and tuning data manipulation operators in single-process environments but executing them in various forms of parallelism. The exchange operator shields the data manipulation operators from all parallelism issues. The design and implementation of the generalized exchange operator are examined. The authors justify their decision to support hierarchical architectures and argue that the exchange operator offers a significant advantage for development and maintenance of database query processing software.

The experiment was designed to overcome some of the deficiencies of previous software testing experiments. A large number of test sets was randomly generated for each of nine subject programs with subtle errors. For each test set, the percentages of executable edges and definition-use associations covered were measured, and it was determined whether the test set exposed an error. Hypothesis testing was used to investigate whether all-uses adequate test sets are more likely to expose errors than are all-edges adequate test sets. Logistic regression analysis was used to investigate whether the probability that a test set exposes an error increases as the percentage of definition-use associations or edges covered by it increases. Error exposing ability was shown to be strongly positively correlated to percentage of covered definition-use associations in only four of the nine subjects. Error exposing ability was also shown to be positively correlated to the percentage of covered edges in four different subjects, but the relationship was weaker.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/238581/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1993","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1993","volume":"19","issue":"8","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 1993","accessionNumber":"4580714","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","displayDocTitle":"An experimental comparison of the effectiveness of branch testing and data flow testing","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An experimental comparison of the effectiveness of branch testing and data flow testing","sourcePdf":"00238581.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.073418S","chronDate":"Aug 1993","isNumber":"6133","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"32","citationCount":"170","articleId":"238581","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":238606,"authors":[{"name":"K.A.

The model accounts for multiphase synchronous clocking, correctly captures the behavior of label-sensitive latches, handles both short- and long-path delays, accommodates wave pipelining, and leads to a comprehensive set of timing constraints. Concurrency of pipeline circuits is defined as a function of the clock schedule and degree of wave pipelining. The authors then identify a special class of clock schedules, coincident multiphase clocks, which provide a lower bound on the value of the optimum cycle time. It is shown that the region of feasible solutions for single-phase clocking can be nonconvex or even disjoint, and a closed-form expression for the minimum cycle time of a restricted but practical form of single-phase clocking is derived. The authors compare these forms of clocking on three pipeline examples and highlight some of the issues in pipeline synchronization.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/43.238606","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00238606.png","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel1/43/6135/00238606.pdf","startPage":"1132","endPage":"1146","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/43.238606","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6135","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=238606","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Synchronization of pipelines","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1993","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1993","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/238606/","displayDocTitle":"Synchronization of pipelines","volume":"12","issue":"8","publicationDate":"Aug. 1993","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4567793","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Synchronization of pipelines","sourcePdf":"00238606.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.037872S","chronDate":"Aug 1993","isNumber":"6135","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","citationCount":"20","articleId":"238606","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":238616,"authors":[{"name":"M.A. Styblinski","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Texas A and M University, College Station, TX, USA"],"firstName":"M.A.","lastName":"Styblinski","id":"37344541600"},{"name":"M.

They make the dimension of the space of achievable velocities smaller than the dimension of the robot's configuration space. Using standard results in differential geometry (Frobenius integrability theorem) and nonlinear control theory, the authors first give a formal characterization of holonomy (and nonholonomy) for robot systems subject to linear differential constraints and state some related results about their controllability. They then apply these results to 'car-like' and 'trailer-like' robots.

This controller's performance is refined by a secondary learning controller, which is a reinforcement learning-based connectionist network. The issue is the representation of the input space of the refinement learning controller. In previous work, the input space was quantized into fixed boxes and each box became a control situation for the learning controller. The drawback was that the learning control designer had to know how to quantize the space. An approach to eliminating the quantization of the input space is described. The new input space representation consists of functions that act as receptive fields and have the shape of multivariate Gaussian probability density functions; they are the first layer in the learning network. Experiments used a tracking control problem with an additive nonlinearity. The learning controller adds an appropriate control signal on the basis of a given evaluation function, in order to improve the fixed controller's ability to track a reference signal.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Input space representation for refinement learning control","publicationTitle":"Proceedings.

In parallel computing the cooperation aspect of concurrency is emphasized, rather than the competitive aspect of multiple processes found in operating system applications. In developing and debugging a parallel computational program, users often want to ensure that their program will terminate (that is, it stops in finite time) and be determinate (that is, the same input data always produce the same result). Using the Petri net graph model, termination and determinacy can be mathematically defined, and algorithms for detecting these properties developed. In fact, the graph model defines an operational semantics for a non-trivial subset of Occam, and can be used as a pedagogical aid as well as a tool for developing and synthesizing Occam programs in parallel computing applications.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/PNPM.1991.238776","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the Fourth International Workshop on Petri Nets and Performance Models PNPM91","pdfPath":"/iel2/370/6138/00238776.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6138","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PNPM.1991.238776","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the Fourth International Workshop on Petri Nets and Performance Models PNPM91","startPage":"116","endPage":"124","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Petri net modelling of Occam programs for detecting indeterminacy, non-termination and deadlock anomalies","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=238776","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 Dec 1991","displayDocTitle":"Petri net modelling of Occam programs for detecting indeterminacy, non-termination and deadlock anomalies","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/238776/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1991","accessionNumber":"4358833","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"2-5 Dec. 1991","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Petri net modelling of Occam programs for detecting indeterminacy, non-termination and deadlock anomalies","confLoc":"Melbourne, VIC, Australia","sourcePdf":"00238776.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.03514S","chronDate":"2-5 Dec 1991","isNumber":"6138","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"370","citationCount":"1","articleId":"238776","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":238840,"authors":[{"name":"Y.

The systolic array processor presented in this paper, called biological information signal processor (BISP), has the capability to satisfy the current and anticipated future computational requirements for performing sequence comparisons based on the T.F. Smith and M.S. Waterman algorithm (1981) as extended by M.S. Waterman and M. Eggert (1987). The BISP can conduct the most time consuming sequence comparison functions, establishing both global and local relationships between two sequences. A modified Smith and Waterman algorithm is presented in this paper for efficient VLSI implementation. Methods are developed to reduce the BISP systolic array I/O bandwidth problem by reporting only the statistical significant results.

The Arithmetic Cube is a special purpose architecture for computing high speed convolution and the DFT. An error analysis is performed for convolution and the DFT, as computed on the Cube. An upper bound on the number of bits lost is derived. The Cube looses at most an extra two bits (four bits), while computing convolution (DFT), more than the number of bits lost if computed by the direct, limited precision convolution (DFT). A VHDL description of the Cube was written and simulations were run. Simulation results substantiate the derived upper bounds. A comparison of the Winograd Fourier-transform-algorithm (WFTA), computed by the Cube, and a rounded FFT, shows that the Cube is at least as accurate as the rounded FFT. Contrary to previous results, it is argued that the WFTA performs better, with respect to accuracy, than the Prime Factor Algorithm (PFA), if both are computed on the Cube.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ASAP.1991.238888","startPage":"129","endPage":"143","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the International Conference on Application Specific Array Processors","pdfPath":"/iel2/491/6140/00238888.pdf","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the International Conference on Application Specific Array Processors","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ASAP.1991.238888","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6140","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The Arithmetic Cube: error analysis and simulation","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Error analysis","Analytical models","High performance computing","Computer architecture","Computational modeling","Convolution","Digital arithmetic","Computer simulation","Digital signal processing","Performance analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["circuit analysis computing","digital signal processing chips","error analysis","fast Fourier transforms","specification languages","VLSI"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["discrete Fourier transform","Arithmetic Cube","error analysis","error performance","special purpose architecture","high speed convolution","upper bound","VHDL description","simulations","upper bounds","Winograd Fourier-transform-algorithm","FFT","Prime Factor Algorithm"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/238888/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-4 Sep 1991","displayDocTitle":"The Arithmetic Cube: error analysis and simulation","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1991","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"2-4 Sept. 1991","accessionNumber":"4382506","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Arithmetic Cube: error analysis and simulation","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"00238888.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.033S","chronDate":"2-4 Sep 1991","isNumber":"6140","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"491","citationCount":"3","articleId":"238888","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":238889,"authors":[{"name":"R.

The proposed system is capable of detecting defective patterns with a size of about 1-5 mu m. The testing speed is much faster than that of a human operator. The false alarm rate is also very low. This performance is achieved by the use of a knowledge-based method utilizing design pattern data. Rule-based decisions are used to identify optimum parameters for inspection and possible defects. The main use of the design pattern data is to specify the inspection area, to designate optimum parameters for inspection, and to identify classification of the defects. Because of the limitations of lab facilities, the system has been tested on simple wafers. The results have been very encouraging. The proposed approach was found to be superior to other techniques used for automatic visual inspection because it frees one from the precise alignment needed to compare images.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/IECON.1991.238937","startPage":"2497","endPage":"2503 vol.3","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings IECON '91: 1991 International Conference on Industrial Electronics, Control and Instrumentation","pdfPath":"/iel2/533/6141/00238937.pdf","publicationTitle":"Proceedings IECON '91: 1991 International Conference on Industrial Electronics, Control and Instrumentation","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IECON.1991.238937","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6141","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Computer based wafer inspection system","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Inspection","Image segmentation","System testing","Humans","Production","Random access memory","Image analysis","Feature extraction","Labeling","Layout"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["automatic test equipment","fault location","image processing","image recognition","inspection","integrated circuit testing","knowledge based systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["rule based decision","LSI","computerised system","segmentation","wafer inspection","automated testing","semiconductor production","wafer pattern","defective patterns","false alarm rate","knowledge-based method","classification","automatic visual inspection"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/238937/","chronOrPublicationDate":"28 Oct-1 Nov 1991","displayDocTitle":"Computer based wafer inspection system","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1991","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"28 Oct.-1 Nov. 1991","accessionNumber":"4291122","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Computer based wafer inspection system","confLoc":"Kobe, Japan","sourcePdf":"00238937.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.028455S","chronDate":"28 Oct-1 Nov 1991","isNumber":"6141","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"533","citationCount":"13","articleId":"238937","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-01"},{"_id":238962,"authors":[{"name":"Y.

It performs 10/sup 7/ complex operations per second, each of which may comprise up to seven elementary operations. The processor has been tested in a number of real-world experiments, including road following. In this application it has demonstrated its ability to analyze a TV image in less than 4 ms. The analysis included six independent tracking processes on different parts of the road's edges, six spatial line-following processes attached to the trackers, and two geometrical models for both edges of the road.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/IECON.1991.239031","publicationTitle":"Proceedings IECON '91: 1991 International Conference on Industrial Electronics, Control and Instrumentation","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings IECON '91: 1991 International Conference on Industrial Electronics, Control and Instrumentation","pdfPath":"/iel2/533/6141/00239031.pdf","startPage":"2019","endPage":"2024 vol.3","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IECON.1991.239031","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6141","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A powerful and flexible co-processor for feature extraction in a robot vision system","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=239031","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"28 Oct-1 Nov 1991","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/239031/","displayDocTitle":"A powerful and flexible co-processor for feature extraction in a robot vision system","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1991","accessionNumber":"4285879","conferenceDate":"28 Oct.-1 Nov. 1991","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A powerful and flexible co-processor for feature extraction in a robot vision system","confLoc":"Kobe, Japan","sourcePdf":"00239031.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.027567S","chronDate":"28 Oct-1 Nov 1991","isNumber":"6141","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"533","citationCount":"5","articleId":"239031","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":239032,"authors":[{"name":"L.

In the learning phase, signals of sensors which monitor the mechanical operation of the recirculating system are preprocessed mainly by spectrum analysis to produce sets of spatiotemporal patterns. The neural network serves the kernel of the diagnostic system, whose main function is the self-organization of a feature map of these spatiotemporal patterns. Each spatiotemporal pattern is a high-dimensional vector composed of 128 elements, and, after self-organization, a reduced 2D feature map is established as composite diagnostic panel (CDP). In the detecting phase, all monitoring signals are fed into the CDP. The basic concept is to make the sensor signals visible. Computer simulations showed that the idea is a suitable approach to the requirement for ensuring visibility of these signals.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/IECON.1991.239113","startPage":"1506","endPage":"1510 vol.2","publicationTitle":"Proceedings IECON '91: 1991 International Conference on Industrial Electronics, Control and Instrumentation","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IECON.1991.239113","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6141","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings IECON '91: 1991 International Conference on Industrial Electronics, Control and Instrumentation","pdfPath":"/iel2/533/6141/00239113.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Diagnoses for machine vibrations based on self-organization neural network","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/239113/","displayDocTitle":"Diagnoses for machine vibrations based on self-organization neural network","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"4280536","publicationDate":"1991","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"28 Oct.-1 Nov. 1991","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"28 Oct-1 Nov 1991","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Diagnoses for machine vibrations based on self-organization neural network","confLoc":"Kobe, Japan","sourcePdf":"00239113.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069988S","chronDate":"28 Oct-1 Nov 1991","isNumber":"6141","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"533","citationCount":"1","articleId":"239113","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":239120,"authors":[{"name":"Guozhong Zhou","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Automation, Tianjin University, TJU, Tianjin, China"],"lastName":"Guozhong Zhou","id":"37087770690"},{"name":"Yaming Sun","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Automation, Tianjin University, TJU, Tianjin, China"],"lastName":"Yaming Sun","id":"37087769240"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-87942-688-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"239120","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":21},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Multi-layer neural network","Convergence","Neurons","Artificial neural networks","Sun","Automation","System identification","Control system synthesis","Process control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["conjugate gradient methods","convergence of numerical methods","learning systems","neural nets","optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["EXOR problem","combined gradient learning algorithm","multilayered neural networks","conjugate gradient optimization","convergence speed","back-propagation","XOR problem","SYMMETRY problem"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=239120","abstract":"A combined gradient learning algorithm is developed based on the gradient and the conjugate gradient optimization algorithms.

For a zero-mean, unit variance, memoryless Gaussian source and a squared-error measure, a 1 bit/sample two-dimensional quantiser with a codebook-excited feedforward neural network is found to always escape from the local minima and converge to the best one of the three local minima which are known to exist in the vector quantiser designed using the LBG algorithm.

Analytical expressions are obtained for the correlation functions for various types of predictive models (linear, nonlinear, and jointly linear and nonlinear) in order to determine the faithfulness of the models to the actual speech data. The analytical results, computer simulations, and speech recognition experiments suggest that when nonlinear and linear prediction are jointly performed within the same layer of the neural network, the model is better able to capture long-term data correlations and consequently improve speech recognition performance.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"30 Sep-1 Oct 1991","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/239500/","accessionNumber":"4377256","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1991","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"30 Sept.-1 Oct. 1991","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Neural-network architecture for linear and nonlinear predictive hidden Markov models: application to speech recognition","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Neural-network architecture for linear and nonlinear predictive hidden Markov models: application to speech recognition","confLoc":"Princeton, NJ, USA","sourcePdf":"00239500.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062483S","chronDate":"30 Sep-1 Oct 1991","isNumber":"6142","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"574","citationCount":"5","articleId":"239500","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":239507,"authors":[{"name":"S.

They believe that this is the first system incorporating a neural network for which the performance has exceeded the state of the art in large-vocabulary, continuous speech recognition. To take advantage of the training and decoding speed of HMMs, the authors have developed a novel hybrid SNN/HMM system that combines the advantages of both types of approaches.

Alternatively transform methods can be used to obtain translation invariance before classification by a neural network. The authors compare the use of second-order neurons to various translation-invariant transforms. The mapping properties of second-order neurons are compared to those of the general class of fast translation-invariant transforms introduced by Wagh and Kanetkar (1977) and to the power spectra of the Walsh-Hadamard and discrete Fourier transforms. A fast transformation based on the use of higher-order correlations is introduced. Three theorems are proven concerning the ability of various methods to discriminate between similar patterns. Second-order neurons are shown to have several advantages over the transform methods.

The optimum data representation for each sub-task of such an application is often unknown and different from the optimum data representation for the other sub-tasks. A method is needed that allows a network that contains several alternate input representations to learn to focus its attention on the best representation(s) for each sub-task to be learned, without a priori information on best representation-sub-task combinations. An adaptive attention focusing method is introduced that addresses this issue. The method involves training recurrent connections for each input module to selectively attenuate input to that module that causes training error in a final target module. The method is shown to have similarities with both gating networks and anti-Hebbian learning. A task scenario is proposed for which adaptive attention focusing provides superior classification performance relative to standard training methods.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/239530/","chronOrPublicationDate":"30 Sep-1 Oct 1991","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"30 Sept.-1 Oct. 1991","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1991","accessionNumber":"4372506","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Learned representation normalization: attention focusing with multiple input modules","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Learned representation normalization: attention focusing with multiple input modules","confLoc":"Princeton, NJ, USA","sourcePdf":"00239530.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.040972S","chronDate":"30 Sep-1 Oct 1991","isNumber":"6142","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"574","articleId":"239530","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":239536,"authors":[{"name":"S.Y.

Because HBTs are operated at high power densities, the ultimate limits on the performance of HBTs are imposed by thermal considerations. The authors address a thermal phenomenon observed when a multifinger power HBT is operating at high power densities. This phenomenon, referred to as the collapse (of current gain), occurs when suddenly one finger of the HBT draws most of the collector current, leading to an abrupt decrease of current gain. A quantitative model and the condition separating the normal operation region and the collapse are presented. Critical difference of the collapse in the constant l/sub b/ and constant V/sub be/ modes of operation is discussed for the common-emitter l-V characteristics. The collapse in the common-base l-V characteristics and its relationship with avalanche breakdown are also described.

A metal-oxide-nitride-oxide-semiconductor (MONOS) structure whose top oxide is fabricated by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) on the nitride is proposed. This CVD oxide is densified by pyrogenic annealing and has stoichiometric SiO/sub 2/ characteristics. Its potential barrier, which prevents stored charges from decaying through the top oxide to the gate, thus becomes sharper than that of the thermally grown top oxide used in the conventional MONOS structure. For comparison between the proposed MONOS, conventional MONOS, and MNOS structures, three devices were fabricated on the same process line. The 16.7-nm nitride thickness in combination with a top oxide thickness of 4.0 nm results in a gate capacitance equivalent to that of the conventional NMOS structure with a 23.5-nm nitride thickness. Moreover, an asymmetric erase/write programming voltage has been adapted to the MONOS device operation by considering both erased-state degradation and written-state retention. At 85 degrees C, the proposed MONOS device has 10/sup 7/-cycle endurance with 10-year data retention.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/16.239742","startPage":"2011","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","pdfPath":"/iel1/16/6162/00239742.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/16.239742","endPage":"2017","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6162","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A novel MONOS nonvolatile memory device ensuring 10-year data retention after 10/sup 7/ erase/write cycles","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/239742/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1993","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1993","displayDocTitle":"A novel MONOS nonvolatile memory device ensuring 10-year data retention after 10/sup 7/ erase/write cycles","volume":"40","issue":"11","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4598691","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Nov. 1993","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A novel MONOS nonvolatile memory device ensuring 10-year data retention after 10/sup 7/ erase/write cycles","sourcePdf":"00239742.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.047879S","chronDate":"Nov 1993","isNumber":"6162","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"88","articleId":"239742","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":239744,"authors":[{"name":"T.

The limitations of the method in finding transmission line propagation characteristics (i.e., characteristic impedance Z/sub 0/ and phase constant beta ) are investigated. An alternative approach for the characterization of MCM interconnects which exploits the capabilities of the FDTD method is suggested. This alternative approach uses the results from the FDTD method to extract the per unit length delay and approximate impulse response of the system. These results can be used to identify the effects of the perforated reference plane on signal propagation.

A second Born approximation is then applied in a iterative manner to achieve better estimates of the structure. Numerical experiments show that this iterative method improves resolution when compared to normal Born inversion due to the fact that coupling between scattering currents is accounted for.

Recognizing the importance of second-order statistics on the one hand, but the increased difficulty in perceiving and comprehending information present in statistics derived from high-dimensional data on the other, the authors propose a method to aid visualization of high-dimensional statistics using a color coding scheme.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul 1993","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/239901/","volume":"31","issue":"4","publicationDate":"July 1993","accessionNumber":"4580783","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul 1993","displayDocTitle":"Analyzing high-dimensional multispectral data","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analyzing high-dimensional multispectral data","sourcePdf":"00239901.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.03056S","chronDate":"Jul 1993","isNumber":"6165","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"133","articleId":"239901","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":239907,"authors":[{"name":"D.T.

Inversion of four parameters is performed based on five brightness temperatures. The four parameters are mean grain size of ice particles in snow, snow density, snow temperature, and snow depth. Iterative inversion of a data-driven forward NN model is justified on a theoretical and methodological basis. An error analysis is performed, comparing iterative inversion of a forward model with the use of an explicit inverse for the retrieval of independent snow parameters from their corresponding measurements. The NN iterative inversion algorithm is further illustrated by reconstructing a synthetic terrain of snow parameters from their corresponding measurements, inverting all four parameters simultaneously. The reconstructed parameter contours are in good agreement with the original synthetic parameter contours.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/36.239907","pdfPath":"/iel1/36/6165/00239907.pdf","startPage":"842","endPage":"852","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/36.239907","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6165","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Retrieval of snow parameters by iterative inversion of a neural network","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/239907/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul 1993","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul 1993","displayDocTitle":"Retrieval of snow parameters by iterative inversion of a neural network","volume":"31","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4580789","publicationDate":"July 1993","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Retrieval of snow parameters by iterative inversion of a neural network","sourcePdf":"00239907.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.04443S","chronDate":"Jul 1993","isNumber":"6165","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"68","articleId":"239907","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":239912,"authors":[{"name":"A.

The basic idea is to generate a two-dimensional reference function for SAR processing which provides, in addition to the matched filtering for the unaliased part of the received signal, the deconvolution of the azimuth ambiguities. This approach corresponds to an ideal filter concept, where an ideal impulse response function is obtained even in the presence of several phase and amplitude errors. Modeling the sampled azimuth signal shows that the absolute phase value of the ambiguities cannot easily be determined due to their undersampling. The concept of the ideal filter is then extended to accommodate the undefined phase of the ambiguities and also the fading of the azimuth signal. Raw data from the E-SAR system have been used to verify the improvement in image quality obtained by the new method. It has a substantial advantage in enabling the pulse-repetition frequency (PRF) constraints in the SAR system design to be relaxed and also for improving SAR image quality and interpretation.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Suppressing the azimuth ambiguities in synthetic aperture radar images","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","doi":"10.1109/36.239912","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel1/36/6165/00239912.pdf","startPage":"885","endPage":"895","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/36.239912","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6165","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=239912","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/239912/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul 1993","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul 1993","displayDocTitle":"Suppressing the azimuth ambiguities in synthetic aperture radar images","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"31","issue":"4","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"July 1993","accessionNumber":"4580794","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Suppressing the azimuth ambiguities in synthetic aperture radar images","sourcePdf":"00239912.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.036353S","chronDate":"Jul 1993","isNumber":"6165","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"70","articleId":"239912","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":239913,"authors":[{"name":"E.J.M.

In a first set of techniques, changes are detected based on differences in the magnitude of the signal intensity between two dates. Ratioing of the multidate radar intensities is shown to be better adapted to the statistical characteristics of SAR data than subtracting, and works best when the number of looks is large. In a second set of techniques, changes are detected based on estimates of the temporal decorrelation of speckle. This method works best with one-look complex amplitude data, but can also be used with intensity data provided that the number of looks is small. The two techniques are compared using actual SAR data collected by ERS-1. The results illustrate the viability as well as the complementary character of these techniques for detecting changes in the structural and dielectric properties of remotely sensed surfaces.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel1/36/6165/00239913.pdf","startPage":"896","endPage":"906","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","doi":"10.1109/36.239913","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/36.239913","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6165","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=239913","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Change detection techniques for ERS-1 SAR data","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Radar detection","Spaceborne radar","Synthetic aperture radar","Satellites","Radar imaging","Radar remote sensing","Radar theory","Remote sensing","Decorrelation","Speckle"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["geophysical techniques","remote sensing by radar","synthetic aperture radar"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["measurement","technique","land surface","geophysics","remote sensing","change detection","satellite method","synthetic aperture radar","temporal variation","ERS-1","imagery","SAR","European Remote Sensing Satellite","multidate"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/239913/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul 1993","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul 1993","displayDocTitle":"Change detection techniques for ERS-1 SAR data","volume":"31","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"July 1993","accessionNumber":"4580795","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Change detection techniques for ERS-1 SAR data","sourcePdf":"00239913.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.032956S","chronDate":"Jul 1993","isNumber":"6165","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"428","articleId":"239913","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-27"}]
