The present work focuses on vector-scan electron-beam technology and processing, while other papers in this series discuss other aspects of the work. Different types of 1 \u00b5m MOSFET chips were written on 57 mm Si wafers using a totally automated electron-beam system which performs table stepping, registration to fiducial marks, and pattern writing in a vector scan mode (on an individual shape basis) with control of exposure dose for individual shapes. The pattern data were prepared by batch processing which includes proximity correction as well as sorting of shapes to achieve data compaction and minimal distance between shapes. A novel two-layer positive resist system has been developed to achieve reproducible liftoff profiles over topography and better linewidth control. The final results presented here demonstrate that there are no fundamental barriers to the extension of this work to small dimensions.","doi":"10.1109/T-ED.1979.19435","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","pdfPath":"/iel5/16/31788/01480013.pdf","startPage":"360","endPage":"368","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/T-ED.1979.19435","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31788","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"1 \u00b5m MOSFET VLSI technology: Part VI\u2014Electron-beam lithography","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1480013","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1979","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1979","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1480013/","displayDocTitle":"1 \u00b5m MOSFET VLSI technology: Part VI\u2014Electron-beam lithography","volume":"26","issue":"4","publicationDate":"April 1979","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"09 August 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"1 \u00b5m MOSFET VLSI technology: Part VI\u2014Electron-beam lithography","sourcePdf":"01480013.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.050586S","chronDate":"Apr 1979","isNumber":"31788","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"8","articleId":"1480013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1979","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-28"},{"_id":1480035,"authors":[{"name":"C.A.

Cell programming occurs via hot-electron injection, exhibiting three distinct operating regimes. Erase, on the other hand, is based on field emission from floating gate to control gate. The magnitude of electrical erase is determined by applied bias, device parameters, and processing history, particularly the interlevel oxidation temperature. Analysis of experimental data shows that electrical erase does change programming characteristics significantly, and must be accounted for in circuit design. Memory retention, determined by thermal stress, is comparable to commercially available EPROM's. The memory cell exhibits better than 1000-cycle write/erase capability, with degradation in interlevel conduction being the principal factor limiting endurance. A 5-V, 16K high-speed EAROM has been developed which shows successful programming and erase behavior at nominal voltages of 25 and 35 V, respectively.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","pdfPath":"/iel5/16/31788/01480040.pdf","startPage":"576","endPage":"586","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An electrically alterable nonvolatile memory cell using a floating-gate structure","doi":"10.1109/T-ED.1979.19462","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31788","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/T-ED.1979.19462","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1480040","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1480040/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1979","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1979","displayDocTitle":"An electrically alterable nonvolatile memory cell using a floating-gate structure","dateOfInsertion":"09 August 2005","publicationDate":"April 1979","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"26","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An electrically alterable nonvolatile memory cell using a floating-gate structure","sourcePdf":"01480040.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.052202S","chronDate":"Apr 1979","isNumber":"31788","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"8","articleId":"1480040","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1979","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1480060,"authors":[{"name":"W.G.

Experimental models of these phenomena are proposed and the smallest possible MOSFET structure, for a given supply voltage, is considered. It is concluded that the smallest feasible device has a channel length of 0.52 \u00b5m and a gate oxide thickness of 9.4 nm when the supply voltage is 1.5 V.

It is particularly important to reduce circuit losses because, when efficient multistage depressed collectors are used, each 2-percent increase in circuit efficiency yields a 1-percent increase in overall efficiency! Attempts to predict losses in helix structures have produced answers that were a factor of at least three below the measured loss. Historically, loss measurements have been very difficult to make, primarily, because of the small values of the quantities being measured. This paper presents an accurate theoretical analysis of the loss of a helix structure. The effect on loss of the dielectric support rods for the helix is taken into account. In addition, helix losses are separated from barrel losses. Functional variations are given of loss with frequency, helix pitch, helix radius, barrel-to-helix diameter ratio, helix and barrel resistivity, and the effective relative dielectric constant of the helix support rods. Measurements of loss, made with a Hewlett-Packard automatic network analyzer and a new automated measurement procedure, are presented. It is shown that excellent agreement between the predicted loss and the measured loss is obtained when helix surface roughness effects on resistivity are taken into account. Also, a correction is made for the increase in measured loss resulting from impedance mismatches between the helix and the measurement circuit and from loss in the sliding short.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Theoretical and experimental TWT helix loss determination","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","doi":"10.1109/T-ED.1979.19656","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","pdfPath":"/iel5/16/31794/01480234.pdf","startPage":"1581","endPage":"1588","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/T-ED.1979.19656","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31794","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1480234","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1480234/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1979","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1979","displayDocTitle":"Theoretical and experimental TWT helix loss determination","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"26","issue":"10","dateOfInsertion":"09 August 2005","publicationDate":"Oct. 1979","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Theoretical and experimental TWT helix loss determination","sourcePdf":"01480234.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.036528S","chronDate":"Oct 1979","isNumber":"31794","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"26","articleId":"1480234","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1979","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1480238,"authors":[{"name":"J.L.

By use of this program, a prediction of gun operation, particularly as it affects gyrotron performance, can be made. Of particular interest are the effects of varying such control parameters as the magnitude of the electric and magnetic fields, the shape of the electric and magnetic fields, and the current. It is demonstrated that, for a particular optimized gun design, the gun operation is very sensitive to both the applied electric and magnetic fields at the cathode.

The characteristics of this system are examined by initially considering two limiting cases. In the first case, an ideal unblocked interface between the electrolyte and the oxide is assumed. Electrochemical processes of ion exchange dominates and consequently, a Nernstian response is experienced. The second limiting case assumes a totally blocked interface such that the behavior of the EOS system is dictated by electrostatic factors.

Two operational modes of SIT image sensors are described here. One is the electron-accumulation mode in which electrons are stored in the floating-cell region and another is the electron-depletion mode in which electrons are removed from the floating-cell region in response to optical input. The electron-depletion mode is superior to the electron-accumulation mode in the charge retention characteristics, its temperature dependence, and the operational tolerancy. The described SIT image sensors, which utilize the vertically configured SITM structure, are very promising for application in very-large-area image converters due to high-speed high-packing density, and wide dynamic range, and especially due to extremely low power dissipation.","doi":"10.1109/T-ED.1979.19804","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","pdfPath":"/iel5/16/31796/01480382.pdf","startPage":"1970","endPage":"1977","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/T-ED.1979.19804","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31796","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Static induction transistor image sensors","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1480382","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1979","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1979","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1480382/","displayDocTitle":"Static induction transistor image sensors","volume":"26","issue":"12","publicationDate":"Dec. 1979","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"09 August 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Static induction transistor image sensors","sourcePdf":"01480382.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.059547S","chronDate":"Dec 1979","isNumber":"31796","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"10","articleId":"1480382","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1979","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1480391,"authors":[{"name":"J.R.

This new capability has arisen primarily through the use of double-diffusion techniques to achieve short active channels and the incorporation of a lightly doped drift region between the channel and the drain contact, which largely supports the applied voltage. Many different structures have been proposed to implement these new devices. This paper considers three of the most common-LDMOS, VDMOS, and VMOS. Structural differences which result in on-resistance and transconductance differences between the devices are described. Quantitative models, suitable for device design, are developed for the on-resistance of each type of structure. These models are developed directly from the physical structure (geometry and doping profiles) so that they are useful in optimizing a particular device structure or in quantitatively comparing structures for a particular application.","doi":"10.1109/T-ED.1980.19868","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","pdfPath":"/iel5/16/31799/01480661.pdf","startPage":"356","endPage":"367","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/T-ED.1980.19868","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31799","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Modeling of the on-resistance of LDMOS, VDMOS, and VMOS power transistors","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1480661","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 1980","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 1980","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1480661/","displayDocTitle":"Modeling of the on-resistance of LDMOS, VDMOS, and VMOS power transistors","volume":"27","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Feb. 1980","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"09 August 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modeling of the on-resistance of LDMOS, VDMOS, and VMOS power transistors","sourcePdf":"01480661.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.041611S","chronDate":"Feb 1980","isNumber":"31799","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"143","articleId":"1480661","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1980","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1480668,"authors":[{"name":"R.J.

A second device (CPT II) incorporates bipolar signal-processing electronics on the same silicon chip to produce a low-duty-cycle pulse-mode output with period related to pressure. This output format helps to re-solve the problem of shunting between leads, which is one of the principal causes of long-term drift in piezoresistive transducers designed for implantable medical applications. Because this device uses capacitance change as a transductional mechanism rather than piezo-resistivity, it is not susceptible to drift caused by temperature variations in the piezoresistive coefficient. Optimization for totally implantable biomedical applications places special emphasis on small size, high sensitivity, improved long-term baseline stability, and greatly reduced power consumption. These properties are also important for a wide range of pressure-sensing applications-from automotive to general industrial use.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","pdfPath":"/iel5/16/31802/01480751.pdf","startPage":"927","endPage":"930","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","doi":"10.1109/T-ED.1980.19958","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/T-ED.1980.19958","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31802","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1480751","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A monolithic capacitive pressure sensor with pulse-period output","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1480751/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1980","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1980","displayDocTitle":"A monolithic capacitive pressure sensor with pulse-period output","volume":"27","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May 1980","dateOfInsertion":"09 August 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A monolithic capacitive pressure sensor with pulse-period output","sourcePdf":"01480751.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.041642S","chronDate":"May 1980","isNumber":"31802","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"144","articleId":"1480751","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1980","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-28"},{"_id":1480755,"authors":[{"name":"R.P.

The reason for the anomalous behavior is the saturation of the ionization coefficient with increasing electric field strength. The anomalous behavior can only be observed if the tunnel breakdown requires a higher field strength as the one required for saturation of the ionization coefficient. This paper presents a rather simple theory yielding analytical solutions for the normal and anomalous avalanche breakdown. Treated is the influence of the doping profile upon the breakdown voltage in plane junctions and the influence of the radius of curvature for cylindrical one-sided abrupt junctions. The influence of the temperature upon the breakdown voltage and the multiplication factor as function of voltage is calculated for one-sided abrupt plane junctions. Finally, the temperature and doping range for the anomalous avalanche breakdown and the transition region is plotted for the semiconductors InSb, InAs, CdHgTe, PbSnTe, Ge, Si, GaAs, and GaP.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","pdfPath":"/iel5/16/31802/01480759.pdf","startPage":"970","endPage":"977","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","doi":"10.1109/T-ED.1980.19966","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/T-ED.1980.19966","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31802","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1480759","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The anomalous avalanche breakdown","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1480759/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1980","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1980","displayDocTitle":"The anomalous avalanche breakdown","volume":"27","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May 1980","dateOfInsertion":"09 August 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The anomalous avalanche breakdown","sourcePdf":"01480759.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.046895S","chronDate":"May 1980","isNumber":"31802","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"2","articleId":"1480759","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1980","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":1480767,"authors":[{"name":"A.A.R.

The design tradeoffs between device parameters and logic characteristics are discussed for an inverter with a resistive load. By increasing the supply voltage to several times that of the built-in voltage, the propagation delay time can be lowered similar to that when using an active load (current source). To investigate the speed-power performance of the IC's, ring oscillators with different fan-in and fan-out configurations were fabricated. A binary frequency divider which uses a master-slave flip-flop was tested. The maximum counting frequency of the divider was 610 MHz at a supply voltage of 1.5 V. This coincides with the results obtained from the ring oscillators with fan-in/fan-out = 2/2. Comparing the experimental results with the theory, the effective electron mobility in the thin channel layer is expected to be very low. By improving the mobility and shortening the gate length to half a micrometer, practical functioning circuits should operate with an average propagation delay time of less than 100 ps.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","pdfPath":"/iel5/16/31803/01480783.pdf","startPage":"1092","endPage":"1097","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design and performance of GaAs normally-off MESFET integrated circuits","doi":"10.1109/T-ED.1980.19990","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31803","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/T-ED.1980.19990","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1480783","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1480783/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1980","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1980","displayDocTitle":"Design and performance of GaAs normally-off MESFET integrated circuits","dateOfInsertion":"09 August 2005","publicationDate":"June 1980","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"27","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design and performance of GaAs normally-off MESFET integrated circuits","sourcePdf":"01480783.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.047294S","chronDate":"Jun 1980","isNumber":"31803","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"5","articleId":"1480783","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1980","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1480787,"authors":[{"name":"B.M.

Optimization of device structures and accurate circuit simulation, particulary as technologies push toward fundamental limits, necessitate an understanding of how impurity doping levels, oxide charge densities, process techniques, and applied electric fields affect carrier surface mobilities. It is the purpose of this paper to present an extensive set experimental results on the behavior of electron surface mobility in thermally oxidized silicon structures. Empirical equations are developed which allow the calculation of electron mobility under a wide variety of substrate, process, and electrical conditions. The experimental results are interpreted in terms of the dominant physical mechanisms responsible for mobility degradation at the Si/SiO\n<inf xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</inf>\ninterface.

The Josephson junction is almost an ideal digital switch exhibiting very abrupt threshold, ultra-high switching speeds (\u223c10 ps), and very low power dissipation (\u223c1 \u00b5W). Logic devices based on the Josephson junctions combine Josephson junctions with other circuit elements to provide isolation to the input signals as well as to provide higher gain than a single junction. These devices can be classified into two groups, the first group uses magnetically coupled SQUID's (Superconducting QUantum Interference Devices) to provide isolation, whereas the second group of circuits utilizes the high-resistance state of a Josephson junction in series with the signal input to provide isolation. Logic circuits based on these two isolation Schemes are compared. In both schemes, higher gains are achieved by the use of either multiple Josephson junctions in parallel or a buffer stage. The buffer stage is a Current-Injection Device (CID) which provides gain and the AND function between the two signal currents injected into it. Some of the unique features of Josephson logic circuits such as terminated superconducting transmission lines, ac power supply, Timed Inverter, and Latch circuits are also examined. The dynamic behavior of the Josephson junctions is modeled by very simple equivalent circuits. The computer simulations based on these models are compared with experiments and found to be in excellent agreement. A family of experimental logic circuits has been designed and experimentally tested using 2.5-\u00b5m minimum feature size. These circuits have fully loaded logic delays of about 40 ps/gate and power dissipation of about 4 \u00b5W/gate. The gate delays and power-delay products are compared with leading semiconductor technologies.","doi":"10.1109/T-ED.1980.20123","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/T-ED.1980.20123","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","pdfPath":"/iel5/16/31807/01480916.pdf","startPage":"1857","endPage":"1869","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31807","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Josephson-logic devices and circuits","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1480916/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1980","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1980","displayDocTitle":"Josephson-logic devices and circuits","volume":"27","issue":"10","dateOfInsertion":"09 August 2005","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 1980","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Josephson-logic devices and circuits","sourcePdf":"01480916.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.067329S","chronDate":"Oct 1980","isNumber":"31807","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"26","articleId":"1480916","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1980","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1480919,"authors":[{"name":"J.P.

These fast logic gates must ultimately generate and record small fast pulses generated by single fluxoid events. This is demonstrated in a concept for a high-speed analog-to-digital (A/D) converter. Low \u03b2-value unlatched SQUID's are used throughout for ultimate speed, sensitivity, and simplicity. The analog signal is quantized by a single-junction SQUID and converted into a pulse train resulting from fluxoid transitions. These are counted in a chain of bistable two-junction SQUID's which successively scale the pulse train by a factor 2. These SQUID's perform both logic and memory functions at the single fluxoid level. The bit count stored in the array is gated out each sampling interval to provide the digitized signal. The performance of this device has been simulated and criteria established for the unlatched SQUID design. These include dimensionality, impedance, damping, intra- and inter-SQUID delays and \u03b2 factor. Large analog dynamic range is available with the high intrinsic linearity of the SQUID quantizer and a long chain of scalers.","doi":"10.1109/T-ED.1980.20126","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/T-ED.1980.20126","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","pdfPath":"/iel5/16/31807/01480919.pdf","startPage":"1887","endPage":"1896","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31807","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analog-to-digital conversion with unlatched SQUID's","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1480919/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1980","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1980","displayDocTitle":"Analog-to-digital conversion with unlatched SQUID's","volume":"27","issue":"10","dateOfInsertion":"09 August 2005","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 1980","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analog-to-digital conversion with unlatched SQUID's","sourcePdf":"01480919.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.030866S","chronDate":"Oct 1980","isNumber":"31807","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"71","articleId":"1480919","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1980","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1480921,"authors":[{"name":"P.L.

Topics receiving detailed discussion include Josephson-junction modeling with both the microscopic and shunted-junction models. Limitations of the shunted-junction model are explored by comparing it with experimental results and with the microscopic model. An approximate evaluation is given of the important dynamical properties of junctions made with the dominant fabrication technology (Pb-alloy systems), as a function of tunneling barrier thickness. Rounding out the device aspects of the discussion, we describe in detail the properties of superconducting microstrip transmission lines, with an emphasis on their high-speed behavior. Turning to simple circuits we review experimental results on the measurement of picosecond regime transient signals. The concept of turn-on delay is analyzed anew, providing simplified and extended results. Details of concepts for pulse height and pulsewidth measurements are explored, leading to the conclusion that the time resolution of superconducting circuits is limited to approximately the period of one plasma oscillation. With present Pb-alloy fabrication technology this limit is 2 ps.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","pdfPath":"/iel5/16/31807/01480925.pdf","startPage":"1945","endPage":"1965","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","doi":"10.1109/T-ED.1980.20132","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/T-ED.1980.20132","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31807","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1480925","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Picosecond applications of Josephson junctions","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1480925/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1980","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1980","displayDocTitle":"Picosecond applications of Josephson junctions","volume":"27","issue":"10","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 1980","dateOfInsertion":"09 August 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Picosecond applications of Josephson junctions","sourcePdf":"01480925.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.062572S","chronDate":"Oct 1980","isNumber":"31807","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"16","articleId":"1480925","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1980","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1481102,"authors":[{"name":"S.

In this paper the programming characteristics of the floating gate EPROM's are discussed in relation to the limiting factors for device parameters and the programming conditions. Some problems which arise from the arrayed cell configuration are clarified. The programming speed of an EPROM is remarkably lowered by the voltage drop in a bit line due to an excess current flow through deselected cells which is induced by pulling up of the floating gate potential due to capacitance coupling between the bit line and the floating gate. A punch-through current in memory cells has the same effect on the programming characteristics. The feasibility of higher density EPROM's are also discussed by taking these problems into account.","doi":"10.1109/IEDM.1980.189746","publicationTitle":"1980 International Electron Devices Meeting","displayPublicationTitle":"1980 International Electron Devices Meeting","pdfPath":"/iel5/9946/31822/01481189.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IEDM.1980.189746","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31822","startPage":"38","endPage":"41","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Limiting factors for programming EPROM of reduced dimensions","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1481189","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Limiting factors for programming EPROM of reduced dimensions","chronOrPublicationDate":"1980","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1481189/","conferenceDate":"8-10 Dec. 1980","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1980","dateOfInsertion":"09 August 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Limiting factors for programming EPROM of reduced dimensions","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"01481189.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.038878S","chronDate":"1980","isNumber":"31822","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9946","citationCount":"17","articleId":"1481189","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1980","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1481196,"authors":[{"name":"T.H.

A bipolar circuit remains optimized for power-delay operation in scaling if the relative contributions to the circuit delay of every capacitance and resistance component of the circuit are kept constant. This condition is realized only by coordinated reductions of both the vertical doping profiles and the horizontal dimensions and appropiately varying the current. As the base width is reduced in scaling, the emitter depth must be reduced proportionately to maintain base width control and reproducibility, and the base doping must be increased to avoid punch through. For emitters less than 200nm deep, the current gain is no longer determined by the base sheet resistance alone, but depends strongly on the emitter contact technology.

A centrally injected current is divided into four equal parts. The current differences of the two pairs of opposite collectors, affected by the two in-plane field components, are the output signals. Consequently, the amplitude and direction of the applied field can be derived from these independent signals. The vector sensor was developed from a one-dimensional sensor having two collectors only.

This work is part of a program to establish the feasibility of monolithic receivers and transmitters at microwave and millimeter-wave frequencies. Receiver designs using high-cutoff frequency diodes in a mixer configuration followed by a MESFET amplifier are capable of operating from microwave through millimeter-wave frequencies. However, the fabrication of monolithic receiver designs requires the integration on the same wafer of devices with different material requirements. We have developed a compatible integration scheme which is fundamental to the fabrication of monolithic receivers at millimeter-wave frequencies. Fabrication and design considerations for the 31-GHz balanced mixer and IF preamplifier are described. Completed monolithic units typically exhibit a conversion gain of 4 dB from the signal frequency of 31 GHz to the IF frequency of 2 GHz. The associated noise figure is typically 11.5 dB.","doi":"10.1109/T-ED.1981.20301","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/T-ED.1981.20301","startPage":"149","endPage":"154","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","pdfPath":"/iel5/16/31824/01481453.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31824","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A 31-GHz monolithic GaAs mixer/preamplifier circuit for receiver applications","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 1981","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 1981","displayDocTitle":"A 31-GHz monolithic GaAs mixer/preamplifier circuit for receiver applications","publicationDate":"Feb. 1981","dateOfInsertion":"09 August 2005","volume":"28","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1481453/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A 31-GHz monolithic GaAs mixer/preamplifier circuit for receiver applications","sourcePdf":"01481453.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.039109S","chronDate":"Feb 1981","isNumber":"31824","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"24","articleId":"1481453","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1981","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":1481454,"authors":[{"name":"B.J.

The technique involves building the device on an epitaxial layer deposited on a more highly doped substrate of the same conductivity type, creating a high-low junction. A simple theoretical model for the carrier diffusion limited modulation transfer function (MTF) is developed for this structure. Calculations of the MTF using this model are compared to similar calculations for other configurations, e.g., a thinned, backside-illuminated device and a frontside-illuminated imager built on a uniformly doped substrate. The calculations show that the new structure has MTF performance comparable to or better than the backside-illuminated device and has, for \u03bb = 1.06 \u00b5m and Nyquist spatial frequency, an MTF which is nearly an order of magnitude higher than that for the nonepitaxial frontside-illuminated device. At the same time, the quantum efficiency of the epitaxial device is reduced by about one order of magnitude. The effects of substrate doping and epitaxial layer thickness are also explored.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A method for improving the spatial resolution of frontside-illuminated CCD's","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","doi":"10.1109/T-ED.1981.20323","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","pdfPath":"/iel5/16/31825/01481475.pdf","startPage":"251","endPage":"256","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/T-ED.1981.20323","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31825","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1481475","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1481475/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1981","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1981","displayDocTitle":"A method for improving the spatial resolution of frontside-illuminated CCD's","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"28","issue":"3","dateOfInsertion":"09 August 2005","publicationDate":"March 1981","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A method for improving the spatial resolution of frontside-illuminated CCD's","sourcePdf":"01481475.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.030328S","chronDate":"Mar 1981","isNumber":"31825","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"27","articleId":"1481475","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1981","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1481478,"authors":[{"name":"M.

The injection current to the gate is the mechanism for programming FAMOS devices and determines the potential degradation of short-channel MOS devices due to electron trapping in the oxide. This work presents an accurate indirect current measurement technique based on charge transport to the floating gate in a FAMOS structure. The measurement bypasses effects of trapping and local heating, allowing full characterization of parameter, voltage, and temperature dependence down to gate current levels of 10\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">-16</sup>\nA. Based on this characterization, a new qualitative model of hot-electron injection into the oxide is proposed. The basic assumption in the model is the spherical symmetry of the momentum distribution function of the hot electrons. This assumption leads to the experimentally observed dominant role of the lateral electric field in the pinchoff region in determining gate current behavior. The model provides an explanation of gate current parameter and voltage dependence, and suggests correlation between gate current and substrate impact ionization current in a range of operating voltages. This correlation is substantiated experimentally for a range of device parameters and voltages.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1481488/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1981","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1981","dateOfInsertion":"09 August 2005","publicationDate":"March 1981","isJournal":true,"volume":"28","issue":"3","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Hot-electron injection into the oxide in n-channel MOS devices","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hot-electron injection into the oxide in n-channel MOS devices","sourcePdf":"01481488.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.030677S","chronDate":"Mar 1981","isNumber":"31825","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"107","articleId":"1481488","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1981","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1481505,"authors":[{"name":"A.

This is not a fundamenta model of the noise mechanisms in GaAs FET's, but rather, an endeavor to relate physically measurable device capacitances and resistances to the device noise figure and optimum noise source impedance. I will be shown that the noise performance of an FET can be adequately described by two uncorrelated noise sources. One, at the input of the FET, is the thermal noise generated in the various resis, tances in the gate-source loop. This noise source is frequency dependent and it can be calculated from the equivalent circuit of the FET. The second noise source, in the Output of the FET, is frequency independent, and not recognizably related to any measured parameters. This output nise is a function of drain current and voltage. The decomposition of the FET noise into two uncorrelated sources simplifies the design of broad-band low noise amplifiers. Once the equivalent circuit of a device and its noise figure at one frequency are known, the optimum noise source impedance and noise figure over a broad range of frequencies may be calculated. For the device designer this model also may be helpful in balancing input-output noise tradeoffs.","doi":"10.1109/T-ED.1981.20375","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","pdfPath":"/iel5/16/31827/01481527.pdf","startPage":"511","endPage":"517","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31827","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/T-ED.1981.20375","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A functional GaAs FET noise model","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1481527","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A functional GaAs FET noise model","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1481527/","volume":"28","issue":"5","publicationDate":"May 1981","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"09 August 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1981","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1981","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A functional GaAs FET noise model","sourcePdf":"01481527.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.031742S","chronDate":"May 1981","isNumber":"31827","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"34","articleId":"1481527","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1981","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":1481529,"authors":[{"name":"R.M.

Because existing models for polysilicon do not accurately predict resistivity dependence on doping concentration as grain size increases above 600 \u00c5, a modified trapping model for polysilicon with different grain sizes and under various applied biases is introduced. Good agreement between theory and experiments demonstrates that an increase in grain size from 230 to 1220 \u00c5 drastically reduces the sensitivity of polysilicon resistivity to doping levels by two orders of magnitude. Such an increase is achieved by modifications of the integrated-circuit processes. Design criteria for the optimization of monolithic polysilicon resistors have also been established based on resistivity control, thermal properties, and device geometry.","doi":"10.1109/T-ED.1981.20437","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","pdfPath":"/iel5/16/31829/01481589.pdf","startPage":"818","endPage":"830","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31829","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/T-ED.1981.20437","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Modeling and optimization of monolithic polycrystalline silicon resistors","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1481589","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul 1981","displayDocTitle":"Modeling and optimization of monolithic polycrystalline silicon resistors","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1481589/","publicationDate":"July 1981","dateOfInsertion":"09 August 2005","isJournal":true,"volume":"28","issue":"7","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul 1981","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modeling and optimization of monolithic polycrystalline silicon resistors","sourcePdf":"01481589.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.116857S","chronDate":"Jul 1981","isNumber":"31829","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"77","articleId":"1481589","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1981","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":1481612,"authors":[{"name":"H.

The depleted base bipolar transistor represents a limiting case when the metallurgical basewidth is allowed to shrink to zero. Such devices, also called bipolar static induction transistors (BSIT), have been proposed as candidates for VLSI logic circuits. This paper describes the basic device physics of depleted base transistors and presents experimental verification of the theoretical modeling. The two essential conclusions that are drawn are that such devices can only achieve performance (in terms of transconductance) comparable to BJT's when an electrical p-type base exists (n-p-n device) and secondly, that BSIT's have characteristics which are extremely sensitive to process variations (linewidths, junction depths, and doping profiles). As a consequence, we conclude that while pure bipolar transistors may play an important role in VLSI circuits, depleted base structures such as the BSlT, are unlikely candidates for such applications.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Small geometry depleted base bipolar transistors (BSIT)\u2014VLSI devices?","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","doi":"10.1109/T-ED.1981.20613","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","pdfPath":"/iel5/16/31833/01481765.pdf","startPage":"1354","endPage":"1363","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/T-ED.1981.20613","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31833","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1481765","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1481765/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1981","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1981","displayDocTitle":"Small geometry depleted base bipolar transistors (BSIT)\u2014VLSI devices?","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"28","issue":"11","dateOfInsertion":"09 August 2005","publicationDate":"Nov. 1981","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Small geometry depleted base bipolar transistors (BSIT)\u2014VLSI devices?","sourcePdf":"01481765.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.050252S","chronDate":"Nov 1981","isNumber":"31833","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"13","articleId":"1481765","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1981","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":1481787,"authors":[{"name":"L.A.

We have run computer calculations using the finite element method, in parallel with experimental work. When an alpha particle penetrates a pn-junction, the generated carriers drastically distort the junction field. After the alpha particle penetration, the field, which was originally limited to the depletion region, extends far down into the bulk silicon along the length of the alpha-particle track and funnels a large number of carriers into the struck junction. After a few nanoseconds, the field recovers to its position in the normal depletion layer, and, if the track is long enough, a residue of carriers is left to be transported by diffusion. The extent of this field funneling is a function of substrate concentration, bias voltage, and the alpha-particle energy.","doi":"10.1109/EDL.1981.25357","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Electron Device Letters","pdfPath":"/iel5/55/31838/01481841.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EDL.1981.25357","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31838","publicationTitle":"IEEE Electron Device Letters","startPage":"103","endPage":"105","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"April  1981","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A field-funneling effect on the collection of alpha-particle-generated carriers in silicon devices","volume":"2","issue":"4","dateOfInsertion":"09 August 2005","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"April 1981","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1481841/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  1981","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A field-funneling effect on the collection of alpha-particle-generated carriers in silicon devices","sourcePdf":"01481841.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.052785S","chronDate":"April  1981","isNumber":"31838","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"55","citationCount":"224","articleId":"1481841","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1981","subType":"IEEE Letter","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1481851,"authors":[{"name":"D.B.

The use of high-aspect ratio channels to increase surface area will, to an extent, further reduce thermal resistance.

The CMP gun is a relatively simple and highly versatile new type of gun for gyrotrons and other transverse wave tubes. Essentially an annular beam is generated in a magnetically shielded region and passes through a short region of radial magnetic field into the uniform field interaction region. Magnetic flux is transmitted through the cathode by means of a soft iron post on the axis. A small current coil may be mounted over the center magnetic post to adjust the enclosed flux. The beam transverse energy may thus be conveniently adjusted from zero to the case where the entire beam rotates about the axis at the cyclotron frequency. In the latter case it is shown that the constant initial flux provided by the CMP geometry meets a necessary condition to provide constant axial velocity for balanced flow at high beam perveance.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31847","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IEDM.1981.190081","publicationTitle":"1981 International Electron Devices Meeting","displayPublicationTitle":"1981 International Electron Devices Meeting","pdfPath":"/iel5/9947/31847/01482034.pdf","startPage":"336","endPage":"338","doi":"10.1109/IEDM.1981.190081","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Magnetically shielded electron guns with a center magnetic post","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"1981","displayDocTitle":"Magnetically shielded electron guns with a center magnetic post","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"7-9 Dec. 1981","publicationDate":"1981","dateOfInsertion":"09 August 2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1482034/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Magnetically shielded electron guns with a center magnetic post","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"01482034.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044009S","chronDate":"1981","isNumber":"31847","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9947","citationCount":"9","articleId":"1482034","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1981","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":1482046,"authors":[{"name":"T.

Test devices are also fabricated using the side wall masked isolation (SWAMI) process, and electrical characristics are measured. At the sharp corners of active- to field region boundaries, threshold lowering occurs because of electric field concentration. The effective channel width associated with the threshold voltage is very narrow ranging from 0.05 um or less to 0.3 um. Both the threshold and the effective width depend on the shape of the corner, and have weaker dependence on the substrate and surface impurity concentrations and substrate bias, than those of the planar surface devices. The optimization of MOS devices with bird's-beak free structure for conventional applications with very tight design rules is discussed. A three-transistor static memory cell utilizing the double threshold (DT) MOST is proposed and analyzed.","displayPublicationTitle":"1981 International Electron Devices Meeting","pdfPath":"/iel5/9947/31847/01482046.pdf","startPage":"380","endPage":"383","publicationTitle":"1981 International Electron Devices Meeting","doi":"10.1109/IEDM.1981.190093","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IEDM.1981.190093","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31847","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1482046","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Double threshold MOSFETs in bird's-beak free structures","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MOSFETs","Impurities","Dielectric substrates","Very large scale integration","Laboratories","Threshold voltage","Shape","Silicon","Analytical models","Testing"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1482046/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1981","displayDocTitle":"Double threshold MOSFETs in bird's-beak free structures","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1981","dateOfInsertion":"09 August 2005","conferenceDate":"7-9 Dec. 1981","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Double threshold MOSFETs in bird's-beak free structures","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"01482046.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059746S","chronDate":"1981","isNumber":"31847","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9947","citationCount":"16","articleId":"1482046","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1981","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1482047,"authors":[{"name":"K.

Attention is focused on hybrid focal-plane arrays using backside-illuminated InAsSb and HgCdTe photovoltaic detectors which are source-coupled into a charge-coupled device (CCD) multiplexer. Background suppression capabilities of the input circuit, charge skimming and partitioning, are experimentally demonstrated. Data on the uniformity and temperature dependence of the input MOSFET threshold voltage are presented. The temperature dependence of the threshold voltage agrees well with theoretically calculated values. Several aspects of the noise problems associated with the hybrid infrared focal-plane arrays are discussed. Noise of a source-coupled input circuit with a feedback amplifier is analyzed and it is shown that although two new noise sources are added, the circuit can operate with less noise than the simple source-coupled input circuit. To further understand focal-plane operation, a noise performance model has been constructed which gives excellent agreement with experimental data. Finally, the performance of hybrid focal-plane arrays is discussed.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1482148/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1982","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1982","dateOfInsertion":"09 August 2005","publicationDate":"Jan. 1982","volume":"29","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Hybrid infrared focal-plane arrays","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hybrid infrared focal-plane arrays","sourcePdf":"01482148.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.037771S","chronDate":"Jan 1982","isNumber":"31848","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"9","articleId":"1482148","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1982","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":1482153,"authors":[{"name":"Y.S.

The present work includes an experimental verification and a qualitative model demonstrating that both punchthrough and drain-source avalanche breakdown limitations are surface and surface-depletion-region dominated mechanisms, respectively.

It is shown that the introduction of only 48 selectively scaled, submicrometer transistors in these circuits can improve the access time by 35 percent theoretically. Using an edge-defined technique which requires only standard optical lithography for insertion of the selectively scaled transistors, the address access time has been improved from 36 to 25 ns.

Use of PMOS transistors as load elements in peripheral circuits of the n-well CMOS RAM reduces the substrate current by at least two orders of magnitude.

In this case, the electric field normal to the Si-SiO\n<inf xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</inf>\ninterface near the drain aids in the injection of hot holes along the channel which initiates acceptor-type interface states.

Results obtained with a special clock for different clocking parameters have been explained, based on the existing model of emission of charge from the surface states.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","pdfPath":"/iel5/16/31855/01482363.pdf","startPage":"1269","endPage":"1276","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","doi":"10.1109/T-ED.1982.20866","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/T-ED.1982.20866","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31855","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1482363","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Feed forward due to barrier modulation in charge-coupled devices","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1482363/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1982","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1982","displayDocTitle":"Feed forward due to barrier modulation in charge-coupled devices","volume":"29","issue":"8","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 1982","dateOfInsertion":"09 August 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Feed forward due to barrier modulation in charge-coupled devices","sourcePdf":"01482363.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.044335S","chronDate":"Aug 1982","isNumber":"31855","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"4","articleId":"1482363","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1982","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1482374,"authors":[{"name":"Y.

The material properties important for this application are discussed and compared for each alloy system. High-purity material necessary for low-capacitance p-n junction detectors can be routinely prepared in the InGaAsP alloy system, and techniques have been developed for the growth of compensated low-carrier-concentration AlGaAsSb alloys to satisfy this requirement. The dark current of photodiodes in both quaternary alloy systems is often limited by tunneling, and high-purity material can also be used to reduce this component of the dark current. There is some indication that tunneling current may be defect-assisted rather than band-to-band. Device structures designed to reduce the electric field in the low band-gap materials and thus reduce the tunneling dark current are also reviewed. The special enhancement of the ionization-coefficient ratio \u03b2/\u03b1 in AlGaSb devices is described, and recent results of measurements of \u03b1 and \u03b2 in (lOO)-InP are presented. Finally, special structures which may permit artificial enhancement of the ionization-coefficient ratio and the design of low-noise high-gain long-wavelength avalanche photodiodes are reviewed.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1482381/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  1982","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  1982","publicationDate":"Sept. 1982","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"09 August 2005","volume":"29","issue":"9","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Long-wavelength (1.3- to 1.6-\u00b5m) detectors for fiber-optical communications","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Long-wavelength (1.3- to 1.6-\u00b5m) detectors for fiber-optical communications","sourcePdf":"01482381.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.079744S","chronDate":"Sept.  1982","isNumber":"31856","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"5","articleId":"1482381","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1982","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1482383,"authors":[{"name":"A.

One is the emission of minority carriers into the substrate from the source junction, the other is sufficient avalanche multiplication to cause significant positive feedback.

Destructive interference between waves from adjacent apertures cancels some diffraction effects and increases the spatial resolution with which such patterns can be projected. A simple theory predicts a near doubling of resolution for illumination with partial incoherence \u03c3 < 0.3, and substantial improvements in resolution for \u03c3 < 0.7. Initial results obtained with a phase-shifting mask patterned with typical device structures by electron-beam lithography and exposed using a Mann 4800 10X tool reveals a 40-percent increase in usuable resolution with some structures printed at a resolution of 1000 lines/mm. Phase-shifting mask structures can be used to facilitate proximity printing with larger gaps between mask and wafer. Theory indicates that the increase in resolution is accompanied by a minimal decrease in depth of focus. Thus the phase-shifting mask may be the most desirable device for enhancing optical lithography resolution in the VLSI/VHSIC era.","doi":"10.1109/T-ED.1982.21037","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","pdfPath":"/iel5/16/31859/01482534.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/T-ED.1982.21037","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31859","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","startPage":"1828","endPage":"1836","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1982","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Improving resolution in photolithography with a phase-shifting mask","volume":"29","issue":"12","dateOfInsertion":"09 August 2005","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 1982","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1482534/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1982","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improving resolution in photolithography with a phase-shifting mask","sourcePdf":"01482534.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.037179S","chronDate":"Dec 1982","isNumber":"31859","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"384","articleId":"1482534","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1982","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1482540,"authors":[{"name":"A.A.

The sensing mechanism of these detector elements is internal photoemission over the energy barrier formed between the metal silicide and the silicon substrate. By lowering the barrier potential the Schottky photoresponse can be extended further into the infrared. This paper reports on a new barrier material, IrSi, which has a barrier height of less than 0.160 ev. This lower barrier improves the infrared performance in two ways. First, this structure will cover the entire 3.0 to 5.0 micrometer region. Secondly, the nature of Schottky photoemission is such that an increase in the long wavelength cutoff leads to increases in sensitivity at all shorter wavelengths.","doi":"10.1109/IEDM.1982.190239","publicationTitle":"1982 International Electron Devices Meeting","displayPublicationTitle":"1982 International Electron Devices Meeting","pdfPath":"/iel5/9948/31872/01482773.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IEDM.1982.190239","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31872","startPage":"157","endPage":"160","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"IrSi Schottky barrier diodes for infrared detection","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1482773","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"IrSi Schottky barrier diodes for infrared detection","chronOrPublicationDate":"1982","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1482773/","conferenceDate":"13-15 Dec. 1982","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1982","dateOfInsertion":"09 August 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"IrSi Schottky barrier diodes for infrared detection","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"01482773.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.039279S","chronDate":"1982","isNumber":"31872","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9948","citationCount":"9","articleId":"1482773","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1982","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1482792,"authors":[{"name":"K.Y.

The distributed network parameters are calculated via a 2-dimensional device simulation program, which takes into account the band-gap narrowing effect as well as the Auger recombination. By varying the topological structure and the distributed network elements according to the process variational parameters, the statistical variations of the device terminal characteristics are obtained through circuit simulation. The procedure of generating the performance-oriented device lumped models from the result of the distributed network simulation is also described.

A recent paper which modelled the structure with an emitting surface of varying curvature combined with a planar collecting surface succeeded in obtaining a good fit to the current-voltage characteristic for electron emission from the non-planar surface. In real textured memory structures, the deposited poly on which the oxide is grown has convex structures. The poly deposited on top of the thermally grown oxide has topological features which are concave and of lesser curvature. These differences lead to asymmetric tunneling characteristics. The previous model for the one-sided case has been extended to the more complex double non-planar case and is able to quantitatively describe the observed characteristics.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1482937/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1982","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1982","dateOfInsertion":"09 August 2005","conferenceDate":"13-15 Dec. 1982","displayDocTitle":"Electron tunneling in non-planar floating gate memory structure","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Electron tunneling in non-planar floating gate memory structure","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"01482937.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.103594S","chronDate":"1982","isNumber":"31872","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9948","citationCount":"6","articleId":"1482937","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1982","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":1482946,"authors":[{"name":"N.C.-C.

It is shown that the change in the Fermi energy with the gate voltage changes the effective separation between the gate and the two-dimensional electron gas by about 80 \u00c5. Current-voltage characteristics were calculated using a two piece as well as a three piece linear approximation for the electron velocity and compared with experimental results. At 300 K, the two piece model overestimates the current predicted by the three piece model only by approximately 10-20 percent. At 77 K, however, the three piece linear approximation for the velocity field characteristic should be used since the electron mobility decreases very abruptly at about 200 V/cm. The effect of the nonlinear source resistance is also discussed along with the gate-to-source and gate-to-drain capacitances, parameters of paramount importance in determining device performance. These capacitances are calculated as functions of gate-to-source and drain-to-source voltages below saturation.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","pdfPath":"/iel5/16/31875/01483002.pdf","startPage":"207","endPage":"212","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","doi":"10.1109/T-ED.1983.21101","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/T-ED.1983.21101","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31875","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1483002","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Current\u2014Voltage and capacitance\u2014Voltage characteristics of modulation-doped field-effect transistors","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1483002/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1983","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1983","displayDocTitle":"Current\u2014Voltage and capacitance\u2014Voltage characteristics of modulation-doped field-effect transistors","volume":"30","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 1983","dateOfInsertion":"09 August 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Current\u2014Voltage and capacitance\u2014Voltage characteristics of modulation-doped field-effect transistors","sourcePdf":"01483002.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.026311S","chronDate":"March  1983","isNumber":"31875","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"117","articleId":"1483002","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1983","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1483020,"authors":[{"name":"R.H.

Defects resulting in DSD's are shown by CL and EBIC to be located in either the p-InGaAsP contact layer or the p-InP confining layer for short aging times. For longer aging times, these defects are also found in the InGaAsP active layer. The presence of gold was not detected at the DSD's using EDS. However, gold was found in the form of submicron size inclusions at the contact layer-confining layer interface of cylindrically-lapped wafers using AES and EDS.

This field-funneling component of charge collection is a strong function of substrate resistivity and bias voltage. It is relatively independent of the area of the struck device. The collection is less efficient for a small capacitance node. The funneling also occurred with a time delay when an alpha particle missed the field region by a short distance. Devices on an n-type substrate were also studied. They exhibit a similar funneling effect as the p-type substrate. The agreement between measurement and simulation is excellent.

By trapping hot electrons uniformly over the channel in n-MOSFET's, it was shown that hot-electron trapping produces only negative oxide charge without generating interface traps.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1983","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1983","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1483130/","volume":"30","issue":"8","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 1983","dateOfInsertion":"09 August 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Effects of hot-carrier trapping in n- and p-channel MOSFET's","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Effects of hot-carrier trapping in n- and p-channel MOSFET's","sourcePdf":"01483130.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.035182S","chronDate":"Aug 1983","isNumber":"31880","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"143","articleId":"1483130","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1983","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1483141,"authors":[{"name":"J.G.

This paper describes a new and significantly more capable version of the program--SUPREM III--which incorporates process models suitable for VLSI device design. This new version of the program is now generally available and should provide a powerful new tool in VLSI design. For the first time, the program models multilayer structures (up to five material layers). It also incorporates substantially upgraded diffusion, oxidation, ion implantation, and other process models. These models incorporate, where possible, recent thinking about underlying physical mechanisms. The program remains a one-dimensional simulator; extensions to two dimensions are discussed. This paper concentrates on the process models and their underlying physics; implementation issues are addressed elsewhere.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1483223/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1983","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1983","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"30","issue":"11","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 1983","dateOfInsertion":"09 August 2005","displayDocTitle":"VLSI Process modeling\u2014SUPREM III","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"VLSI Process modeling\u2014SUPREM III","sourcePdf":"01483223.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.056461S","chronDate":"Nov 1983","isNumber":"31883","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"63","articleId":"1483223","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1983","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1483226,"authors":[{"name":"Keunmyung Lee","affiliation":["Department Electrical Engineering and Computer Science and Research Laboratory, University of California, Berkeley, CA, USA"],"lastName":"Keunmyung Lee","id":"37087415840"},{"name":"Y.

An approximate curvilinear square algorithm is used for rapid evaluation of the two-dimensional equivalent number of lateral squares to an accuracy of a few percent. Studies of resistance for single steps and linear gaps are used to determine rules of thumb for resistance dependence on aspect rations, sidewall slope, and facet size. Studies of interlayer capacitance show the importance of reflow shape and the nonscalable sidewall capacitance component. Typical topography effects for today's devices show a fourfold increase in the two-dimensional RC product contribution to signal delay relative to planar structures. New deposition technologies which provide better step coverage are shown to be necessary to improve the scalability of signal delay. A meanderline test structure is used to verify the accuracy of resistance simulation and explore a new bias-sputtering technology.","doi":"10.1109/T-ED.1983.21325","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","pdfPath":"/iel5/16/31883/01483226.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/T-ED.1983.21325","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31883","startPage":"1469","endPage":"1474","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Topography-dependent electrical parameter simulation for VLSI design","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1483226","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Topography-dependent electrical parameter simulation for VLSI design","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  1983","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1483226/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov.  1983","isJournal":true,"volume":"30","issue":"11","publicationDate":"Nov. 1983","dateOfInsertion":"09 August 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Topography-dependent electrical parameter simulation for VLSI design","sourcePdf":"01483226.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.044848S","chronDate":"Nov.  1983","isNumber":"31883","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"2","articleId":"1483226","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1983","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1483229,"authors":[{"name":"K.C.

The tunnel junction is viewed as imposing boundary conditions on the usual set of differential equations governing the electrostatic potential and carrier distributions within the semiconductor. These equations are then solved using the approximation techniques applied in conventional p-n junction theory. Full Fermi-Dirac statistics are used where necessary in the model, and surface states are treated using a Shockley-Read-Hall approach. In computing the band-to-metal tunnel currents, it is assumed that each valley in the conduction band and peak in the valence band can be assigned a single tunneling probability factor describing all transitions between that valley or peak and the metal. On making the above approximations, it is found that the state of the junction is described by two coupled nonlinear algebraic equations, which can be solved by routine iterative techniques. The model is applied to generate current-voltage characteristics for a minority-carrier AI-SiO\n<inf xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">x</inf>\n- pSi diode, operated both in the dark and as a solar cell, and for a negative barrier AI-SiO\n<inf xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">x</inf>\n-nSi contact exhibiting photocurrent multiplication.

However, the device previously described is slow in turn-off, having a fall time in the range 8 to 40 \u00b5s. The purpose of our present work has been to reduce the fall time significantly and to increase the latching current level of the COMFET, while retaining its desirable features. By modification of the epitaxial structure and addition of recombination centers, we have achieved fall times as low as 0.1 \u00b5s and latching currents as high as 50 A, while retaining on-resistance values < 0.2 ohms for a 0.09 cm\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\nchip area.

As discussed in Reference (1), the maximum operating current density is limited by the latch-up of a parasitic thyristor inherent in the device structure. Using two dimensional computer modelling, it has been shown that this latch-up can be suppressed by reducing the lateral sheet resistance of the p-base. This has been experimentally achieved by the addition of a high concentration boron diffusion in the DMOS cells. The electrical characteristics of 25 Amp, 500 Volt IGT devices designed and fabricated using the modelling results will be presented.

In terms of electron trapping, the observed results can be explained by the existence of two different traps: intrinsic and high field generated traps. The densities of these traps are determined by the nitridation condition and subsequent heat cycles. The lowest density of electron traps was observed in an annealed nitrided oxide (NO). The results also have implications for radiation damage and hot electron channel degradation in thin gate dielectrics. Under very high electric fields, destructive breakdowns were observed for nitrided oxide, probably due to the absence of electron traps. Such breakdowns restrict the design of EEPROM's using such dielectrics.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1483598/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1983","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"5-7 Dec. 1983","dateOfInsertion":"09 August 2005","publicationDate":"1983","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Electrical properties of nitrided-oxide systems for use in gate dielectrics and EEPROM","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Electrical properties of nitrided-oxide systems for use in gate dielectrics and EEPROM","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"01483598.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059376S","chronDate":"1983","isNumber":"31897","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9949","citationCount":"41","articleId":"1483598","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1983","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":1483613,"authors":[{"name":"M.

It was also found that the time, \u03c4, that it takes for\n<tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">G_{m} or V_{th}</tex>\nto degrade a certain degree, can be expressed as\n<tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">\\tau \\propto (1/V_{D})</tex>\nfor a V\n<inf xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">D</inf>\nrange of greater than 2.5 V.

By a careful analysis of the different processes of emission of electrons towards the conduction band and of holes towards the valence band, depending on the charge state of the interface, all the previously ill-understood phenomena can be explained and the deviations from the simple charge-pumping theory can be accounted for. The presence of a geometric component in some transistor configurations is illustrated and the influence of trapping time constants is discussed.

In this amplifier, the collector current increases linearly with time while the transistor is saturated. We assume linear charge parameters of the transistor, and rectangular-wave base-drive current. The following are determined: the waveforms of all components of the base current and the base stored charge, the switching times, the driving power, and the power gain. A new definition of the overdrive factor of the transistor is introduced and the condition of the transistor saturation is discussed.

Since the common practice for reducing subthreshold leakage is to enhance substrate impurity concentration where punchthrough occurs, we therefore conclude that different strategies of process tailoring are required for MOSFET's of different gate material, surface polarity, and interface properties.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1483833/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  1984","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"April  1984","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"31","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"April 1984","dateOfInsertion":"09 August 2005","displayDocTitle":"Dominant subthreshold conduction paths in short-channel MOSFET's","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dominant subthreshold conduction paths in short-channel MOSFET's","sourcePdf":"01483833.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.024329S","chronDate":"April  1984","isNumber":"31901","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"14","articleId":"1483833","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1984","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1483835,"authors":[{"name":"G.

The resulting design flexibility allows the design of FET's with quarter-micrometer channel length to be made, for either room temperature or liquid-nitrogen temperature. The physical limitations of the scaling theory are then investigated in detail, leading to the conclusion that the limiting FET performances are not reached at the 0.25-\u00b5m channel length.

The grains and grain boundaries of polysilicon, the interfacial oxide-like layer between polycrystalline and monocrystalline silicon are lumped respectively into \"boxes\" in which the drift minority current component is neglected. The mobility reduction of carriers in polysilicon on the whole is explicitly attributed to the additional scattering due to the lattice disorder in the grain boundaries and the carrier tunneling through the interface. The effect of the poly-contacts on transistors can be modeled as a reduced surface recombination velocity for minority carriers in combination with a series emitter resistance for majority carriers. Furthermore, by characterizing the monocrystalline emitter with an effective recombination velocity, the effect of the polysilicon layer on the current gain can be analyzed analytically. Computer simulation is used to verify the assumptions of the model formulation. Using published data [1], the analytical and numerical approaches are compared and it is shown that for these devices a unique combination of physical parameters are needed for the model to fit the data.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","pdfPath":"/iel5/16/31903/01483891.pdf","startPage":"773","endPage":"784","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","doi":"10.1109/T-ED.1984.21606","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/T-ED.1984.21606","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31903","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1483891","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A comprehensive analytical and numerical model of polysilicon emitter contacts in bipolar transistors","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1483891/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1984","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1984","displayDocTitle":"A comprehensive analytical and numerical model of polysilicon emitter contacts in bipolar transistors","volume":"31","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"June 1984","dateOfInsertion":"09 August 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A comprehensive analytical and numerical model of polysilicon emitter contacts in bipolar transistors","sourcePdf":"01483891.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.044304S","chronDate":"Jun 1984","isNumber":"31903","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"60","articleId":"1483891","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1984","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":1483896,"authors":[{"name":"A.

Detailed electrical measurements have been made on these devices including the temperature dependence of the gain over a wide temperature range. The transistors given an RCA clean have gains approximately five times higher than those given an HF etch. In addition, the temperature dependence of the gain is different for the two types, with the HF devices exhibiting a much stronger dependence at high temperatures than the RCA devices. A detailed comparison is made with the theory and it is shown that the characteristics of the HF devices can largely be explained using a transport theory, while those of the RCA devices can be fully explained using a modified tunneling theory.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","pdfPath":"/iel5/16/31904/01483907.pdf","startPage":"853","endPage":"860","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","doi":"10.1109/T-ED.1984.21622","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/T-ED.1984.21622","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31904","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1483907","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Comparison of experimental and theoretical results on polysilicon emitter bipolar transistors","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1483907/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul 1984","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul 1984","displayDocTitle":"Comparison of experimental and theoretical results on polysilicon emitter bipolar transistors","volume":"31","issue":"7","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"July 1984","dateOfInsertion":"09 August 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Comparison of experimental and theoretical results on polysilicon emitter bipolar transistors","sourcePdf":"01483907.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.050229S","chronDate":"Jul 1984","isNumber":"31904","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"86","articleId":"1483907","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1984","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1483922,"authors":[{"name":"J.G.

Top three layers form a germanium p-i-n diode, which is removed from the Ge-Si interface by a buffer layer of high conductivity. An advantage of this structure is that its performance is insensitive to material defects in the buffer layers. Moreover, transmission electron microscopy shows that the density of dislocations introduced by lattice mismatch at the Ge-Si interface falls off with the separation from the interface. Our first experimental structures do exhibit the characteristics of a germanium p-i-n diode. The spectral response curves agree with those given in the literature for germanium, both at room and liquid nitrogen temperatures.

Good agreement was obtained between the two techniques. An electron-to-hole oxide current ratio in the range of 20-40 was observed for a 33-\u00c5 tunnel oxide. In addition, the impact ionization hole generation current was found to be 2-5 percent of the electron tunneling current. This excess hole generation appears to be balanced in the stable high current state by back diffusion from a super-inverted semiconductor surface. The impact ionization phenomenon results in a newly discovered voltage controlled n-type negative resistance when the MTOS junction is coupled to an adjacent p-n junction through the use of an intermediate control gate.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Measurement of hole leakage and impact ionization currents in bistable metal\u2014tunnel-oxide\u2014semiconductor junctions","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","doi":"10.1109/T-ED.1984.21683","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","pdfPath":"/iel5/16/31906/01483968.pdf","startPage":"1168","endPage":"1174","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/T-ED.1984.21683","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31906","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1483968","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1483968/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1984","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1984","displayDocTitle":"Measurement of hole leakage and impact ionization currents in bistable metal\u2014tunnel-oxide\u2014semiconductor junctions","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"31","issue":"9","dateOfInsertion":"09 August 2005","publicationDate":"Sept. 1984","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Measurement of hole leakage and impact ionization currents in bistable metal\u2014tunnel-oxide\u2014semiconductor junctions","sourcePdf":"01483968.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.047174S","chronDate":"Sep 1984","isNumber":"31906","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"6","articleId":"1483968","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1984","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1483972,"authors":[{"name":"G.

Presently, the spectrum of what are referred to as \"power devices\" span a very wide range of devices and technology from the massive 4 in, 3000-A thyristor to the high-voltage integrated circuit and the power MOSFET, a device of VLSI complexity containing up to 150 000 separate transistors. In this paper, the past, present, and future of power devices will be reviewed. The first section will be a historical perspective indicating the key events and developments of the past that brought the power devices of today to their present state. The second section of the paper will review the technology and characteristics of bipolar power devices with separate subsections on thyristors, the gate turnoff thyristor (GTO), and the bipolar transistor. Within the thyristor subsection there will be discussions of the phase control thyristor, the inverter thyristor, the asymmetric thyristor (ASCR) the reverse conducting thyristor (RCT), the gate-assisted turn-off thyristor (GATT), and finally the light-triggered thyristor (LTT). The third section of the paper is devoted to the new field of integrated power devices and will review the evolution to the present power MOS devices including the power MOSFET, the insulated gate transistor (IGT), and the high voltage IC (HVIC). The last section of the paper reviews the future of power devices with projections as to future ratings of power devices for both the traditional bipolar devices, such as the thyristor, GTO, and bipolar transistor, as well as the integrated devices such as the MOSFET and the IGT. In case of the former, in particular the thyristor, the maximum device ratings will be tied to the availability of large area float zone material, currently difficult to obtain in the high resistivities needed for power devices. In the case of integrated devices, the maximum ratings will be limited by the maximum die area for which acceptable device yields can be obtained. This is identical to the situation for conventional IC's since much of the unit processing is the same.","doi":"10.1109/T-ED.1984.21754","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","pdfPath":"/iel5/16/31908/01484039.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/T-ED.1984.21754","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31908","startPage":"1570","endPage":"1591","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The evolution of power device technology","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1484039","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"The evolution of power device technology","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1984","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1484039/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1984","isJournal":true,"volume":"31","issue":"11","publicationDate":"Nov. 1984","dateOfInsertion":"09 August 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The evolution of power device technology","sourcePdf":"01484039.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.084723S","chronDate":"Nov 1984","isNumber":"31908","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"80","articleId":"1484039","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1984","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1484047,"authors":[{"name":"T.P.

In addition to the thermally generated noise, usually measured in buried-channel MOS transistors, an excess noise is sometimes seen at moderate to large drain biases. This phenomenon is also observed in this amplifier. However, an explanation for the effect, confirmed by measurement, is presented and a method to avoid degradation of the amplifier performance is found.","doi":"10.1109/T-ED.1984.21776","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","pdfPath":"/iel5/16/31909/01484061.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/T-ED.1984.21776","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31909","startPage":"1713","endPage":"1719","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design and performance of a low-noise charge-detection amplifier for VPCCD devices","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1484061","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Design and performance of a low-noise charge-detection amplifier for VPCCD devices","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1984","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1484061/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1984","isJournal":true,"volume":"31","issue":"12","publicationDate":"Dec. 1984","dateOfInsertion":"09 August 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design and performance of a low-noise charge-detection amplifier for VPCCD devices","sourcePdf":"01484061.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.023721S","chronDate":"Dec.  1984","isNumber":"31909","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"4","articleId":"1484061","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1984","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1484069,"authors":[{"name":"A.A.

Based on this theory we derive analytical expressions for the current-voltage characteristics and relate the short-circuit common emitter current gain to the material parameters, doping levels, grading length, and device temperature. We demonstrate that the thermoemission transport across the interface spike limits the rate of increase in the collector current with the emitter-base voltage and, as a consequence, the maximum common emitter current gain. Tunneling also plays an important role, especially for abrupt heterojunctions. Our calculations reveal an important role played by grading of the composition of the emitter region in the vicinity of the heterointerface. Such grading decreases the barrier height at the interface and greatly enhances the emitter injection efficiency.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31909","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/T-ED.1984.21784","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","pdfPath":"/iel5/16/31909/01484069.pdf","startPage":"1758","endPage":"1765","doi":"10.1109/T-ED.1984.21784","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An investigation of the effect of graded layers and tunneling on the performance of AlGaAs/GaAs heterojunction bipolar transistors","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1984","displayDocTitle":"An investigation of the effect of graded layers and tunneling on the performance of AlGaAs/GaAs heterojunction bipolar transistors","volume":"31","issue":"12","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 1984","dateOfInsertion":"09 August 2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1484069/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1984","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An investigation of the effect of graded layers and tunneling on the performance of AlGaAs/GaAs heterojunction bipolar transistors","sourcePdf":"01484069.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.029882S","chronDate":"Dec 1984","isNumber":"31909","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"62","articleId":"1484069","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1984","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":1484081,"authors":[{"name":"N.

This behavior implies even more severe constraints on the operating regime for these nonconventional device structures at submicrometer gatelengths to maintain adequate reliability margins.","doi":"10.1109/EDL.1984.25836","publicationTitle":"IEEE Electron Device Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Electron Device Letters","pdfPath":"/iel5/55/31912/01484212.pdf","startPage":"71","endPage":"74","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EDL.1984.25836","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31912","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Structure-enhanced MOSFET degradation due to hot-electron injection","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1484212","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1984","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1984","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1484212/","displayDocTitle":"Structure-enhanced MOSFET degradation due to hot-electron injection","volume":"5","issue":"3","publicationDate":"March 1984","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"09 August 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Structure-enhanced MOSFET degradation due to hot-electron injection","sourcePdf":"01484212.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.030088S","chronDate":"Mar 1984","isNumber":"31912","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"55","citationCount":"113","articleId":"1484212","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1984","subType":"IEEE Letter","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1484221,"authors":[{"name":"C.G.

In this method, the internally gettered epitaxial wafer is used as the starting material for fabrication of the CCD image sensor. Use of the epitaxial layer, which is free from the resistivity striation as in the CZ bulk crystals, is found to eliminate the concentric circle image pattern. It is also shown that internal gettering for epitaxial wafers remarkably suppresses the generation of thermally induced white blemishes, as a result of fixing oxygen atoms as precipitates inside the substrate. Based on this technique we have fabricated \"Super-8\" format CCD image sensors. By comparing the reproduced images with those of the conventional CZ-wafer CCD, the present method is shown to be extremely powerful for obtaining the noiseless CCD image sensors.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Elimination of fixed pattern noise in super-8 format CCD image sensor by the use of epitaxial wafers","publicationTitle":"1984 International Electron Devices Meeting","doi":"10.1109/IEDM.1984.190634","displayPublicationTitle":"1984 International Electron Devices Meeting","pdfPath":"/iel5/9950/31922/01484405.pdf","startPage":"32","endPage":"35","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IEDM.1984.190634","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31922","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1484405","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1484405/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1984","displayDocTitle":"Elimination of fixed pattern noise in super-8 format CCD image sensor by the use of epitaxial wafers","conferenceDate":"9-12 Dec. 1984","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"09 August 2005","publicationDate":"1984","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Elimination of fixed pattern noise in super-8 format CCD image sensor by the use of epitaxial wafers","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"01484405.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044068S","chronDate":"1984","isNumber":"31922","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9950","citationCount":"2","articleId":"1484405","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1984","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":1484413,"authors":[{"name":"J.

Devices of this class function in the on-state and off-state in a manner indistinguishable from a thyristor, yet can switch from on-to-off or off-to-on by applying a voltage to its MOS gate. Thus, the devices exhibit extremely low forward drop, high surge current capability and enjoy negative thermal feedback. To turn off the device, one activates the gate so that FET's are turned on to effectively short one of the emitting junctions of the thyristor. These FET's need only block a maximum of about IV when off and carry a sizable current for about a microsecond when on. To turn on the device, any of the normal methods may be employed. However, it is most convenient to use the same MOS gate electrode (and polysilicon layer) and a voltage of the opposite polarity to turn on the thyristor with another FET - just as if it were a normal MOS gated thyristor. The current density that can be turned off depends on the density and effective resistance of the turn-off FET's, while turn-on speed and di/dt rating depend on the initial turn-on area which, in turn, depends on the density of the on-FET's. If the off-gate voltage is maintained during the desired off-state period, the device has, effectively, an infinite dv/dt capability. Switching speed is most similar to, but somewhat faster than, that of GTO's (Gate Turn-Off thyristors) and, as in other bipolar devices, depends chiefly on carrier recombination time, device thickness and turn-off di/dt.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"MOS Controlled thyristors (MCT's)","publicationTitle":"1984 International Electron Devices Meeting","doi":"10.1109/IEDM.1984.190702","displayPublicationTitle":"1984 International Electron Devices Meeting","pdfPath":"/iel5/9950/31922/01484473.pdf","startPage":"282","endPage":"285","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IEDM.1984.190702","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31922","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1484473","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1484473/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1984","displayDocTitle":"MOS Controlled thyristors (MCT's)","conferenceDate":"9-12 Dec. 1984","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"09 August 2005","publicationDate":"1984","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"MOS Controlled thyristors (MCT's)","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"01484473.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.027736S","chronDate":"1984","isNumber":"31922","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9950","citationCount":"93","articleId":"1484473","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1984","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1484491,"authors":[{"name":"M.

By means of the optimized process, soft error rate is reduced by three orders of magnitude compared with that of the unprotected structure, and no performance degradation has been observed.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A P-type buried layer for protection against soft errors in high density CMOS static RAMs","doi":"10.1109/IEDM.1984.190821","startPage":"706","endPage":"709","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IEDM.1984.190821","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31922","publicationTitle":"1984 International Electron Devices Meeting","displayPublicationTitle":"1984 International Electron Devices Meeting","pdfPath":"/iel5/9950/31922/01484592.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1484592","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1484592/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1984","displayDocTitle":"A P-type buried layer for protection against soft errors in high density CMOS static RAMs","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"09 August 2005","publicationDate":"1984","conferenceDate":"9-12 Dec. 1984","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A P-type buried layer for protection against soft errors in high density CMOS static RAMs","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"01484592.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050349S","chronDate":"1984","isNumber":"31922","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9950","citationCount":"5","articleId":"1484592","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1984","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1484603,"authors":[{"name":"Y.H.

High-quality ultrathin films of silicon nitride and nitrided-oxide (nitroxide) have been thermally grown in ammonia atmosphere in a cold-wall RF-heated reactor and in a lamp-heated system. The growth kinetics and their dependence on processing time and temperature have been studied from very short to long nitridation times. The kinetics of thermal nitridation of SiO\n<inf xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</inf>\nin ammonia ambient have also been studied. In nitroxide, nitrogen-rich layers are formed at the surface and interface at a very early stage of the nitridation. Then the nitridation reaction mainly goes on in the bulk region with the surface and near interface nitrogen content remaining fairly constant. Our results also indicate the formation of an oxygen-rich layer at the interface underneath the nitrogen-rich layer whose thickness increases slowly with nitridation time. The nitride and nitroxide films were analyzed using Auger electron spectroscopy, grazing angle Rutherford backscattering, and etch rate measurements. MIS devices were fabricated using these films as gate insulators and were electrically characterized using\n<tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">I - V, C - V</tex>\n, time-dependent breakdown, trapping, and dielectric breakdown techniques.

TOPMOST solves Poisson's and current continuity equations using the finite-difference method and the box-integration technique, which has been extended to suit an arbitrary three-dimensional structure. The device simulator can be optionally coupled with a two-dimensional process simulator for investigating the influence of process conditions on device performances. Using TOPMOST, the subthreshold current characteristics of a fully recessed oxide structure are examined. The mechanism underlying the hump is clarified, and the dependence on structure parameters, such as channel width, gate oxide thickness, and gate extension, are studied. It is shown that there is a worst case where the current hump becomes most conspicuous. It is also shown that the hump can be suppressed by a side-wall implantation.","doi":"10.1109/T-ED.1985.21961","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","pdfPath":"/iel5/16/31924/01484708.pdf","startPage":"441","endPage":"445","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/T-ED.1985.21961","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31924","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis of an anomalous subthreshold current in a fully recessed oxide MOSFET using a three-dimensional device simulator","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1484708","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 1985","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 1985","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1484708/","displayDocTitle":"Analysis of an anomalous subthreshold current in a fully recessed oxide MOSFET using a three-dimensional device simulator","volume":"32","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Feb. 1985","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"09 August 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis of an anomalous subthreshold current in a fully recessed oxide MOSFET using a three-dimensional device simulator","sourcePdf":"01484708.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.030323S","chronDate":"Feb 1985","isNumber":"31924","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"18","articleId":"1484708","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1985","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1484724,"authors":[{"name":"M.

The second anomaly is kinetic and consists in a parasitic transient in the drain-source current following an abrupt change in drain-source voltage. The time constants of the transients are observed to be very sensitive to the side-gate electrode potential. The effects of different technological and operational parameters are studied. One surprising result is the very high sensitivity of side-gating to chemical wet and dry treatments and to dielectric encapsulation of the unprotected substrate surfaces.

Polysilicon contacts were deposited and heat treated at different conditions.

Typical probe dimensions include a length of 3 mm, shank width of 50 \u00b5m, and a thickness of 15 \u00b5m. These structures are capable of simultaneous high-amplitude multichannel recording of neural activity in the cortex. The probe fabrication process requires only four masks and is single-sided using wafers of normal thickness, resulting in yields which exceed 80 percent.

The pattern noise, however, changes with test conditions and is not an intrinsic array property. We develop here a relationship between the pattern noise and the fluctuations in density parameters that produce it. Determining these fundamental parameters makes clear the source of the noise and permits calculation of the filter-array performance for any conditions of interest. The analysis shows how the filter-array spectral shapes influence the pattern noise and how it can be reduced. The pattern noise of CFA's of the dyed photopolymer type is reported. Monochromatic measurements, using microdensitometry and an image sensor with an RGBG striped array, confirm a predicted increase in pattern noise with dye density. Fitting the data to the model yields fluctuations in dye coverage of 0.2-0.4 percent, depending on the dye. For a frame-transfer CCD in white light (5500 K) this corresponds to pattern noise of 0.4 percent or less. Power spectra show that these variations in dye concentration occur largely over sensor dimensions, not pixel spacings.","doi":"10.1109/T-ED.1985.22138","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","pdfPath":"/iel5/16/31930/01484884.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/T-ED.1985.22138","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31930","startPage":"1411","endPage":"1416","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis and measurement of pattern noise in color-filter arrays for image sensors","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1484884","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Analysis and measurement of pattern noise in color-filter arrays for image sensors","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1985","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1484884/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1985","isJournal":true,"volume":"32","issue":"8","publicationDate":"Aug. 1985","dateOfInsertion":"09 August 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis and measurement of pattern noise in color-filter arrays for image sensors","sourcePdf":"01484884.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.034057S","chronDate":"Aug 1985","isNumber":"31930","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"1","articleId":"1484884","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1985","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1484886,"authors":[{"name":"J.

The antiblooming structure incorporated in the device uses an electron-hole recombination principle, and the sensor is suitable for attachment of a separate striped color filter. Device processing and design considerations derived from the two-dimensional simulations of potential profiles are discussed together with other important parameters such as dynamic range, resolution, charge transfer efficiency, reduction of hot-hole effects, and clocking requirements.

The device adopts a vertical overflow drain principle, a buried,channel amplifier, three-level polysilicon technology, and 1.5-\u00b5m-rule fine-pattern process. The device operates with an NTSC format. The 560 TV lines limiting resolution is obtained in the horizontal direction. No significant loss in transfer efficiency is observed in the horizontal register, even at the 14.32 MHz clock rate. Optimal photosensitivity spectrum response is obtained and the peak response appears at 550 nm. The noise equivalent signal is reduced to 48 electrons, using correlated double sampling. Then, the dynamic range reaches 68 dB. The correlated double sampling, combined with buried-channel amplifier technology is found to be also effective for great reduction in horizontal line noise.","doi":"10.1109/T-ED.1985.22145","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","pdfPath":"/iel5/16/31930/01484891.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/T-ED.1985.22145","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31930","startPage":"1457","endPage":"1461","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A CCD image sensor with 768 \u00d7 490 pixels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1484891","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A CCD image sensor with 768 \u00d7 490 pixels","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1985","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1484891/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1985","isJournal":true,"volume":"32","issue":"8","publicationDate":"Aug. 1985","dateOfInsertion":"09 August 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A CCD image sensor with 768 \u00d7 490 pixels","sourcePdf":"01484891.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.056646S","chronDate":"Aug 1985","isNumber":"31930","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"3","articleId":"1484891","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1985","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1484892,"authors":[{"name":"N.

To eliminate the problems, new structures and new driving modes are proposed. As a result, the shading is reduced to a practically negligible level, and the flicker and the fixed pattern noise are completely suppressed.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","pdfPath":"/iel5/16/31930/01484892.pdf","startPage":"1462","endPage":"1468","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","doi":"10.1109/T-ED.1985.22146","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/T-ED.1985.22146","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31930","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1484892","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design consideration of p-well structure for solid-state image sensors","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["CCD image sensors","Charge transfer","Electric potential","Electrodes","Charge coupled devices","Logic gates"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1484892/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  1985","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug.  1985","displayDocTitle":"Design consideration of p-well structure for solid-state image sensors","volume":"32","issue":"8","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 1985","dateOfInsertion":"09 August 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design consideration of p-well structure for solid-state image sensors","sourcePdf":"01484892.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.055464S","chronDate":"Aug.  1985","isNumber":"31930","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"1","articleId":"1484892","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1985","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1484896,"authors":[{"name":"H.

The RANS circuits accelerate the charge-transfer speed from vertical signal lines to a horizontal BCD register with 98-percent efficiency. They also decrease the effective signal line capacitance, so noise due to the transfer MOS switches is suppressed to obtain a high signal-to-noise ratio of 46 dB at a standard scene illumination of 180 lx (F1.4) with no image lag and blooming.

First, we characterize the image reversal by means of the characteristic curves, thus optimizing the process. A simple analytical model and a two-dimensional numerical simulation program have been developed in order to evaluate the dependence of the edge slope of the image-reversed resist line on resist and exposure parameters. Experimental investigation confirmed the simulation result that both positive and negative line edge slopes can be achieved with the image-reversal process by properly adjusting the exposure parameters. Finally, the image-reversal process has been compared experimentally to the standard positive process, considering linewidth control on profiled surfaces.","doi":"10.1109/T-ED.1985.22175","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","pdfPath":"/iel5/16/31931/01484921.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/T-ED.1985.22175","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31931","startPage":"1654","endPage":"1661","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Image reversal of positive photoresist: Characterization and modeling","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1484921","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Image reversal of positive photoresist: Characterization and modeling","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1985","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1484921/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1985","isJournal":true,"volume":"32","issue":"9","publicationDate":"Sept. 1985","dateOfInsertion":"09 August 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Image reversal of positive photoresist: Characterization and modeling","sourcePdf":"01484921.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.028964S","chronDate":"Sep 1985","isNumber":"31931","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"3","articleId":"1484921","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1985","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1484937,"authors":[{"name":"T.

After stress, the threshold voltage was found to have increased at low drain voltages but to have remained unchanged at higher drain voltages, and the saturation transconductance was virtually unchanged for operation in the normal mode. For operation in the inverse mode (source and drain interchanged), the threshold voltage was found to have increased, independent of drain voltage, while the saturation transconductance was decreased. The threshold voltage for inverted operation increased monotonically with stress time, while the saturation transconductance decreased initially and then saturated. This saturation corresponds to an order of magnitude decrease in carrier mobility in the channel near the drain. These results are interpreted using a model in which the threshold voltage and channel mobility are position-dependent. While hot-electron-induced degradation may not be a problem for devices operated only in the forward saturation region, it could be a serious problem for devices such as bilateral switches.","doi":"10.1109/T-ED.1985.22208","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","pdfPath":"/iel5/16/31931/01484954.pdf","startPage":"1850","endPage":"1857","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/T-ED.1985.22208","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31931","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hot-electron-induced degradation in MOSFET's at 77 K","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1484954","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1985","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1985","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1484954/","displayDocTitle":"Hot-electron-induced degradation in MOSFET's at 77 K","volume":"32","issue":"9","publicationDate":"Sept. 1985","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"09 August 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hot-electron-induced degradation in MOSFET's at 77 K","sourcePdf":"01484954.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.063585S","chronDate":"Sep 1985","isNumber":"31931","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"11","articleId":"1484954","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1985","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1484975,"authors":[{"name":"H.R.

It is found that the ratio of the electron to hole impact ionization rates is roughly two orders of magnitude in the staircase APD while \u03b1/\u03b2 is enhanced by one order of magnitude in the quantum well device.","doi":"10.1109/T-ED.1985.22258","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","pdfPath":"/iel5/16/31933/01485004.pdf","startPage":"2197","endPage":"2205","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/T-ED.1985.22258","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31933","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Theory of electron and hole impact ionization in quantum well and staircase superlattice avalanche photodiode structures","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1485004","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1985","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1985","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1485004/","displayDocTitle":"Theory of electron and hole impact ionization in quantum well and staircase superlattice avalanche photodiode structures","volume":"32","issue":"11","publicationDate":"Nov. 1985","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"09 August 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Theory of electron and hole impact ionization in quantum well and staircase superlattice avalanche photodiode structures","sourcePdf":"01485004.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.033473S","chronDate":"Nov 1985","isNumber":"31933","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"18","articleId":"1485004","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1985","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":1485013,"authors":[{"name":"A.A.

Ohmic contacts were characterized by a variety of test structures in close proximity to each other. Measurements of front, end, and interfacial contact resistance were used to calculate the specific contact resistance by the transmission line model (TLM) and the two-dimensional resistor network model. The validity of these models in describing contacts to GaAs is discussed. Normalized contact resistance as low as 0.06 \u03a9 . mm in MODFET's exhibiting semiconductor sheet resistance of 536 \u03a9/ are reported, contributing only 10 percent to the correspondingly reduced parasitic resistances. This leads to high extrinsic transconductances of 240mS/mm at 300 K in devices with a gate length of 1.4 \u00b5m and to extraordinary small drain-source saturation voltages of about 0.6 V. Both effects lead to much improved MODFET performance which would be not only advantageous in small-signal, but especially in high-speed/low-power logic circuits.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1985","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1485013/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1985","volume":"32","issue":"11","publicationDate":"Nov. 1985","dateOfInsertion":"09 August 2005","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Characterization of extremely low contact resistances on modulation-doped FET's","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Characterization of extremely low contact resistances on modulation-doped FET's","sourcePdf":"01485013.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.043086S","chronDate":"Nov 1985","isNumber":"31933","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"4","articleId":"1485013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1985","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":1485023,"authors":[{"name":"B.

The BICFET has three terminals: a metallic emitter which makes ohmic contact to a semi-insulator (wide bandgap semiconductor); a source terminal which contacts an inversion layer formed at the interface between the semi-insulator and the semiconductor depletion region; and a collector which is the semiconductor bulk. An important feature of this bipolar device is the absence of the base layer and all of its associated problems. The principle of operation is based on controlling the flow of majority carriers through the semi-insulating region to the collector by the biasing action of charge in the inversion channel. A significant advantage of the BICFET structure is that it is not subject to the scaling limitations due to punchthrough as in the MOS or junction bipolar transistor. The problem of threshold control in the MOS transistor is avoided, so the requirement of very shallow junctions may be relaxed.","doi":"10.1109/T-ED.1985.22281","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","pdfPath":"/iel5/16/31933/01485027.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/T-ED.1985.22281","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31933","startPage":"2345","endPage":"2367","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The bipolar inversion channel field-effect transistor (BICFET)\u2014A new field-effect solid-state device: Theory and structures","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1485027","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"The bipolar inversion channel field-effect transistor (BICFET)\u2014A new field-effect solid-state device: Theory and structures","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1985","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1485027/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1985","isJournal":true,"volume":"32","issue":"11","publicationDate":"Nov. 1985","dateOfInsertion":"09 August 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The bipolar inversion channel field-effect transistor (BICFET)\u2014A new field-effect solid-state device: Theory and structures","sourcePdf":"01485027.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.043875S","chronDate":"Nov 1985","isNumber":"31933","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"38","articleId":"1485027","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1985","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1485033,"authors":[{"name":"C.D.

It is designed in such a way that only electrons impact-ionize, thereby eliminating the feedback noise associated with conventional two-carrier avalanche devices. Because the electron multiplication can occur only at a small number of discrete locations in the device, the variability of the number of electrons generated per detected photon is minimized. The excess noise and the electron counting distribution are obtained as a function of the number of stages in the device and the impact-ionization probability per stage, for instantaneous multiplication. The (single-photon) impulse response function is calculated when the effects of (random) transit time are incorporated into the carrier multiplication process. Inclusion of the time dynamics is essential for determining the time course of the current generated by the device in response to pulses of light. This, in turn, permits bit error rates to be calculated for systems incorporating the device. For a five-stage quaternary device the gain-bandwidth product is calculated to be in the vicinity of 600 GHz.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","pdfPath":"/iel5/16/31934/01485138.pdf","startPage":"2615","endPage":"2623","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","doi":"10.1109/T-ED.1985.22392","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/T-ED.1985.22392","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31934","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1485138","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Noise properties and time response of the staircase avalanche photodiode","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1485138/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1985","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1985","displayDocTitle":"Noise properties and time response of the staircase avalanche photodiode","volume":"32","issue":"12","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 1985","dateOfInsertion":"09 August 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Noise properties and time response of the staircase avalanche photodiode","sourcePdf":"01485138.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.071303S","chronDate":"Dec 1985","isNumber":"31934","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"27","articleId":"1485138","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1985","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":1485177,"authors":[{"name":"T.

Increasing the overlap between the gate and drain is found to reduce hot-electron degradation significantly when stressed under the same substrate current level. By increasing the gate-to-drain overlap, it is possible to design LDD and As/P devices with a shorter n-region and still have good hot-electron reliability. These devices have better current drive and are scalable down to the submicrometer region. The As/P device with a short n-region is a good candidate for a submicrometer VLSI device because of the simplicity in processing, the good device performance, and the low susceptibility to hot-electron degradation.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1485304/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul 1985","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul 1985","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"6","issue":"7","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"July 1985","dateOfInsertion":"09 August 2005","displayDocTitle":"Submicrometer device design for hot-electron reliability and performance","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Submicrometer device design for hot-electron reliability and performance","sourcePdf":"01485304.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.035223S","chronDate":"Jul 1985","isNumber":"31941","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"55","citationCount":"5","articleId":"1485304","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1985","subType":"IEEE Letter","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1485316,"authors":[{"name":"J.

From the reset noise measurement experiment, it has been inferred that reset noise consists of sensing capacitance Cs dependent part and effective reset channel length L dependent part. Conventional reset noise theory, where the Johnson noise in reset MOS channel was regarded as the only reset noise source, agrees with the Cs dependent part of measured reset noise. However, it cannot explain the L dependent part. To explain the L dependence, the authors propose \"partition noise\" caused by carrier partition in the reset MOS channel. Partition noise has been analyzed by the unique technique of solving the one-dimensional diffusion equation. As a result, a reset channel capacitance dependent characteristic for partition noise has been derived, which agrees with the L dependent part for measured reset noise. Consequently, in addition to Johnson noise, partition noise is found to be a noise source in CCD signal detection.","doi":"10.1109/IEDM.1985.190999","publicationTitle":"1985 International Electron Devices Meeting","displayPublicationTitle":"1985 International Electron Devices Meeting","pdfPath":"/iel5/9951/31947/01485549.pdf","startPage":"452","endPage":"455","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IEDM.1985.190999","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31947","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Partition noise in CCD signal detection","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1485549","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"1985","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1485549/","displayDocTitle":"Partition noise in CCD signal detection","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1985","conferenceDate":"1-4 Dec. 1985","dateOfInsertion":"09 August 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Partition noise in CCD signal detection","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"01485549.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.033547S","chronDate":"1985","isNumber":"31947","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9951","citationCount":"1","articleId":"1485549","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1985","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1485562,"authors":[{"name":"H.

These behaviors are qualitatively discussed with an effective mass model and carrier transport process. The Si surface orientation dependence of hot carrier-induced degradation is found to be related to the number of interface state.

The GaAs MESFET's on Si with 1.2-\u00b5m gate length (290-\u00b5m width) exhibited transconductances (g\n<inf xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">m</inf>\n) of 180 mS/mm with good saturation and pinchoff whereas their counterparts on GaAs substrates exhibited g\n<inf xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">m</inf>\nof 170 mS/mm. A current gain cut-off frequency of 13.5 GHz was obtained, which compares with 12.9 GHz observed in similar-geometry GaAs MESFET's on GaAs substrates. The other circuit parameters determined from S-parameter measurements up to 18 GHz showed that whether the substrate is Si or GaAs does not seem to make a difference. Additionally, the microwave performance of these devices was about the same as that obtained in devices with identical geometry fabricated at Tektronix on GaAs substrates. The side-gating effect has also been measured in both types of devices with less than 10-percent decrease in drain current when 5 V is applied to a pad situated 5 \u00b5m away from the source. The magnitude of the sidegating effect was identical to within experimental determination for all side-gate biases in the studied range of 0 to -5 V. The light sensitivity of this effect was also very small with a change in drain current of less that 1 percent between dark and light conditions for a side gate bias of -5 V and a spacing of 5 \u00b5m. Carrier saturation velocity depth profiles showed that for both MESFET's on GaAs and Si substrates, the velocity was constant at 1.5 \u00d7 10\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">7</sup>\ncm/s to within 100-150 \u00c5 of the active layer-buffer layer interface.","doi":"10.1109/T-ED.1986.22467","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","pdfPath":"/iel5/16/31949/01485684.pdf","startPage":"206","endPage":"213","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/T-ED.1986.22467","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31949","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A dc and microwave comparison of GaAs MESFET's on GaAs and Si substrates","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1485684","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 1986","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 1986","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1485684/","displayDocTitle":"A dc and microwave comparison of GaAs MESFET's on GaAs and Si substrates","volume":"33","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Feb. 1986","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"09 August 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A dc and microwave comparison of GaAs MESFET's on GaAs and Si substrates","sourcePdf":"01485684.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.052526S","chronDate":"Feb 1986","isNumber":"31949","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"6","articleId":"1485684","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1986","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":1485686,"authors":[{"name":"M.W.

Simple analysis based on the short-channel approximation revealed that an increase in a total layer thickness between a gate electrode and 2DEG at a hetero-interface results in a higher cutoff frequency and a lower noise figure than conventional 2DEG FET's. This is because the gate capacitance can be markedly reduced without a significant decrease in the transconductance owing to a parasitic source resistance. The surface undoped layer intentionally employed in this work can permit the total layer thickness to increase, i.e., the gate capacitance to reduce, without changes in the 2DEG density and in the source resistance. This structure also gives high gate breakdown voltage because of a small neutral region in n- (AlGa)As and a low surface electron field, which possibly yields excellent performance 2DEG FET's for practical use. Fabricated (AlGa)As/ GaAs 2DEG FET's exhibited noticeable room-temperature performances of 0.95-dB noise figure with 10.3-dB associated gain at 12- and 45-GHz cutoff frequency.

Theoretical and experimental analysis of WRITE/ERASE characteristics for this type of memory cell are presented. A simplified device model is given based on the concept of coupling ratios. The WRITE operation is adequately represented by the simplified model. The ERASE operation is complicated due to formation of depletion layers in the transistor's channel and under the tunnel oxide. Experimental investigation of these effects is described, and they are included in a detailed cell model. In certain cell structures, a hole current can flow from the drain into the substrate during the ERASE oepration. This effect is shown to be associated with positive charge trapping in the tunnel oxide and threshold window opening. An experimental investigation of these phenomena is described, and a recommendation is made to avoid them by an appropriate cell design.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1485793/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1986","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1986","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","publicationDate":"June 1986","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"09 August 2005","volume":"33","issue":"6","displayDocTitle":"Analysis and modeling of floating-gate EEPROM cells","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis and modeling of floating-gate EEPROM cells","sourcePdf":"01485793.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.040531S","chronDate":"Jun 1986","isNumber":"31953","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"141","articleId":"1485793","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1986","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1485795,"authors":[{"name":"J.

The sensor employs electron-hole recombination antiblooming and achieves high performance by both maximizing the well capacity and reducing the reset noise using an on-chip correlated clamp sample and hold signal processing technique. The imager conforms to the NTSC standard and is intended for color camera applications. The details described include processing modifications, circuit optimization for maximum signal-to-noise performance, and various layout illustrations with emphasis on the design of the three serial registers that multiplex the signals into the three individual outputs. The minimal driving requirements characteristic of the virtual-phase CCD device have been preserved by interconnecting the serial registers with the gates of signal-processing transistors and by applying timing pulses that clock the registers as well as provide the appropriate signal-processing functions. Discussions presented in the paper are focused on comparisons of theoretical predictions of maximum attainable performance with measured results.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","pdfPath":"/iel5/16/31953/01485795.pdf","startPage":"850","endPage":"862","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","doi":"10.1109/T-ED.1986.22578","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/T-ED.1986.22578","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31953","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1485795","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High-resolution 8-mm CCD image sensor with correlated clamp sample and hold charge detection circuit","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1485795/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1986","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1986","displayDocTitle":"High-resolution 8-mm CCD image sensor with correlated clamp sample and hold charge detection circuit","volume":"33","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"June 1986","dateOfInsertion":"09 August 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High-resolution 8-mm CCD image sensor with correlated clamp sample and hold charge detection circuit","sourcePdf":"01485795.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.034715S","chronDate":"Jun 1986","isNumber":"31953","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"11","articleId":"1485795","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1986","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1485815,"authors":[{"name":"J.

Voltage and current distributions predicted by the transmission line model are in excellent agreement with two-dimensional numerical simulations. Parameter values for the model are easily related to vertical doping profiles and to a wide variety of parasitic p-n-p-n layouts.

The studied device is a 0.1-\u00b5m MOSFET on an ultrathin nearly intrinsic SOI structure that is thought to be useful to suppress short-channel effects. To carry out the calculation, intravalley scattering with acoustic phonon and intervalley inelastic scattering have been taken into account in our model. Surface roughness scattering has also been considered in a particle manner using a classical model, which is a combination of both specular reflection and diffused scattering. In order to take the avalanche breakdown phenomena into account, a two-carrier many-particle Monte Carlo method has been used here. We proposed a new model for the impact ionization probability, and also for the velocity distribution of both the primary electron and the generated electron-hole pairs in this paper.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","pdfPath":"/iel5/16/31954/01485823.pdf","startPage":"1005","endPage":"1011","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","doi":"10.1109/T-ED.1986.22606","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/T-ED.1986.22606","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31954","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1485823","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Modeling of 0.1-\u00b5m MOSFET on SOI structure using Monte Carlo simulation technique","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1485823/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul 1986","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul 1986","displayDocTitle":"Modeling of 0.1-\u00b5m MOSFET on SOI structure using Monte Carlo simulation technique","volume":"33","issue":"7","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"July 1986","dateOfInsertion":"09 August 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modeling of 0.1-\u00b5m MOSFET on SOI structure using Monte Carlo simulation technique","sourcePdf":"01485823.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.031135S","chronDate":"Jul 1986","isNumber":"31954","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"20","articleId":"1485823","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1986","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":1485824,"authors":[{"name":"J.C.S.

The characteristic shapes of these distributions are compared with those of the single-carrier conventional avalanche photodiode and the photomultiplier tube. The electron counting distributions, which assume Poisson photocarrier injection, are used to calculate the error performance of a simple optical communication system. This performance is compared with that achievable by a single-carrier conventional APD receiver of identical quantum efficiency and gain. For simplicity of calculation, the system consists of a transmitter emitting light pulses containing a Poisson number of photons and a maximum-likelihood integrate-and-dump receiver. It makes use of binary on-off keying and is subject to noise events arising from multiplied background radiation and/or multiplied dark noise. The performance of the superlattice photodiode receiver turns out to be always superior to that of the single-carrier conventional photodiode receiver, for all values of the gain. The advantage can attain several orders of magnitude (even though the excess noise factors for the two devices lie within a factor of two). The superlattice receiver with high impact-ionization probability is shown to behave like an ideal photon counter with the same quantum efficiency, even if the device has many stages. The deleterious effects of receiver thermal noise on probability of error are examined.","doi":"10.1109/T-ED.1986.22697","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","pdfPath":"/iel5/16/31957/01485914.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/T-ED.1986.22697","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31957","startPage":"1475","endPage":"1488","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Counting distributions and error probabilities for optical receivers incorporating superlattice avalanche photodiodes","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1485914","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Counting distributions and error probabilities for optical receivers incorporating superlattice avalanche photodiodes","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1986","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1485914/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1986","isJournal":true,"volume":"33","issue":"10","publicationDate":"Oct. 1986","dateOfInsertion":"09 August 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Counting distributions and error probabilities for optical receivers incorporating superlattice avalanche photodiodes","sourcePdf":"01485914.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.090543S","chronDate":"Oct 1986","isNumber":"31957","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"9","articleId":"1485914","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1986","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1485918,"authors":[{"name":"M.C.

Delta-function absorption of a single photocarrier and single-carrier-initiated/single-carrier multiplication conditions are assumed. The result is obtained as a limiting case of a previously derived equation for the staircase avalanche photodiode. The initial exponential growth of the curves is shown to represent electron and hole contributions arising from multiplication in the avalanche region whereas the subsequent exponential decay arises from residual holes transiting backward across the multiplication region. The associated frequency response function is obtained by Fourier transformation. The analytical results are shown to be in good accord with average impulse response functions obtained by Riad and Hayes by means of simulation from the transport equations. The results should also apply to the channeling avalanche photodiode and to related structures in which the carriers are spatially separated and the multiplication is essentially single-carrier like.","doi":"10.1109/T-ED.1986.22701","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","pdfPath":"/iel5/16/31957/01485918.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/T-ED.1986.22701","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31957","startPage":"1511","endPage":"1517","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Time and frequency response of the conventional avalanche photodiode","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1485918","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Time and frequency response of the conventional avalanche photodiode","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1986","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1485918/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1986","isJournal":true,"volume":"33","issue":"10","publicationDate":"Oct. 1986","dateOfInsertion":"09 August 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Time and frequency response of the conventional avalanche photodiode","sourcePdf":"01485918.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.052788S","chronDate":"Oct 1986","isNumber":"31957","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"19","articleId":"1485918","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1986","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1485920,"authors":[{"name":"N.S.

We therefore have developed a comprehensive MODFET device model that accurately accounts for such high gate bias effects as transconductance degradation and increased gate capacitance. The device model, which agrees with experimental devices fabricated in this laboratory, is used in the simulation of direct-coupled FET logic (DCFL) inverters with saturated resistor loads. Based on simulation results, the importance of large driver threshold voltage not only for small propagation delay times but for wide logic swings and noise margins is demonstrated. Furthermore, minimum delay times are found to occur at small supply voltages as seen experimentally. Both of these results are attributed to the reduction of detrimental high gate bias effects. The major effect of reducing the gate length on delay time is to decrease the load capacitance of the gate. Using 0.25-\u00b5m gates, delay times of 5 and 3.6 ps at 300 and 77 K, respectively, are predicted. Finally, the recently introduced In-GaAs/AlGaAs MODFET's are shown to have switching speeds superior to those of conventional GaAs/AlGaAs MODFET's.","doi":"10.1109/T-ED.1986.22720","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","pdfPath":"/iel5/16/31958/01485937.pdf","startPage":"1626","endPage":"1634","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/T-ED.1986.22720","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31958","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"GaAs/AlGaAs and InGaAs/AlGaAs MODFET inverter simulations","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1485937","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1986","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1986","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1485937/","displayDocTitle":"GaAs/AlGaAs and InGaAs/AlGaAs MODFET inverter simulations","volume":"33","issue":"11","publicationDate":"Nov. 1986","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"09 August 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"GaAs/AlGaAs and InGaAs/AlGaAs MODFET inverter simulations","sourcePdf":"01485937.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.054587S","chronDate":"Nov 1986","isNumber":"31958","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"14","articleId":"1485937","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1986","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":1485946,"authors":[{"name":"K.

LIGT devices employing either a buried layer or surface shorts are shown to current limit rather than latching up.","doi":"10.1109/T-ED.1986.22853","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","pdfPath":"/iel5/16/31959/01486070.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/T-ED.1986.22853","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31959","startPage":"1956","endPage":"1963","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"n-channel lateral insulated gate transistors: Part I\u2014Steady-state characteristics","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1486070","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"n-channel lateral insulated gate transistors: Part I\u2014Steady-state characteristics","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1986","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1486070/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1986","isJournal":true,"volume":"33","issue":"12","publicationDate":"Dec. 1986","dateOfInsertion":"09 August 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"n-channel lateral insulated gate transistors: Part I\u2014Steady-state characteristics","sourcePdf":"01486070.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.027169S","chronDate":"Dec 1986","isNumber":"31959","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"45","articleId":"1486070","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1986","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":1486079,"authors":[{"name":"A.

With the DMOS device, many other signal components have been obtained whose electrical and structural characteristics are discussed in relation to some process variables.

By controlled device fabrication splits, it is confirmed that these asymmetrical device characteristics are caused by the 7\u00b0 off-axis drain-source implant which creates different degrees of offset between the gate edge and the source-drain junctions. The offset degrades the I-V characteristics. Substrate and gate current asymmetries are studied by analyzing the channel electrical field using two-dimensional device simulations. High-channel field at the source end is proposed to explain the second hump in the double-humped substrate current characteristic and the strong gate current injection when the devices are operated with the nonoverlap side as the source. One way to avoid the shadowing effect at ion implantation is to etch the poly-gate side wall to a small positive level angle.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1986","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1486100/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1986","volume":"7","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 1986","dateOfInsertion":"09 August 2005","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Asymmetrical characteristics in LDD and minimum-overlap MOSFET's","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Asymmetrical characteristics in LDD and minimum-overlap MOSFET's","sourcePdf":"01486100.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.033845S","chronDate":"Jan 1986","isNumber":"31960","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"55","citationCount":"15","articleId":"1486100","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1986","subType":"IEEE Letter","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1486101,"authors":[{"name":"N.

This proposed new process mainly consists of a new nitride masking structure for a two-step field oxidation and a self-aligned field implantation. Using a thin nitridized oxide as a buffer layer underneath the oxidation mask, the bird's beak of the first field oxide is largely reduced by the nitridation-enhanced interface sealing ability. No additional masking steps are required. The MOSFET's with various channel widths have been fabricated and characterized, and comparisons between the new isolation technique and the conventional LOCOS have been made. The improvement in device performance using the proposed isolation technique in MOS/VLSI fabrication is also clearly demonstrated.","doi":"10.1109/EDL.1986.26315","publicationTitle":"IEEE Electron Device Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Electron Device Letters","pdfPath":"/iel5/55/31961/01486138.pdf","startPage":"124","endPage":"126","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EDL.1986.26315","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31961","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A new fully recessed-oxide (FUROX) field isolation technology for scaled VLSI circuit fabrication","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1486138","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 1986","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 1986","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1486138/","displayDocTitle":"A new fully recessed-oxide (FUROX) field isolation technology for scaled VLSI circuit fabrication","volume":"7","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Feb. 1986","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"09 August 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new fully recessed-oxide (FUROX) field isolation technology for scaled VLSI circuit fabrication","sourcePdf":"01486138.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.082556S","chronDate":"Feb 1986","isNumber":"31961","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"55","citationCount":"5","articleId":"1486138","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1986","subType":"IEEE Letter","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1486151,"authors":[{"name":"J.

This model is derived from a quasi-two-dimensional analysis under the assumption of a uniform doping profile. A field reduction factor, indicating the effectiveness of an LDD design in reducing the peak channel field, is used to compared LDD structures with, without, and with partial gate/drain overlap. Plots showing the trade-off between, and the process-dependencies of, the field reduction factor (FRF) and the series resistance are presented for the three cases. Structures with gate/drain overlap are found to provide greater field reduction than those without the overlap for the same series resistance introduced. This should be considered when comparing the double-diffused and spacer LDD structures. It is shown that gate/drain offset can cause the rise of channel field and substrate current at large gate voltages. Good agreement with simulations is obtained.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1986","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1486151/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1986","volume":"7","issue":"3","publicationDate":"March 1986","dateOfInsertion":"09 August 2005","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A theoretical study of gate/Drain offset in LDD MOSFET's","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A theoretical study of gate/Drain offset in LDD MOSFET's","sourcePdf":"01486151.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.036523S","chronDate":"Mar 1986","isNumber":"31962","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"55","citationCount":"9","articleId":"1486151","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1986","subType":"IEEE Letter","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1486154,"authors":[{"name":"C.

The net charge in the oxide and interface states after any hot carrier stress is shown to be positive.","doi":"10.1109/EDL.1986.26425","publicationTitle":"IEEE Electron Device Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Electron Device Letters","pdfPath":"/iel5/55/31966/01486248.pdf","startPage":"428","endPage":"430","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EDL.1986.26425","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31966","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Evaluation of hot carrier degradation of N-channel MOSFET's with the charge pumping technique","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1486248","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"July  1986","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  1986","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1486248/","displayDocTitle":"Evaluation of hot carrier degradation of N-channel MOSFET's with the charge pumping technique","volume":"7","issue":"7","publicationDate":"July 1986","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"09 August 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Evaluation of hot carrier degradation of N-channel MOSFET's with the charge pumping technique","sourcePdf":"01486248.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.032649S","chronDate":"July  1986","isNumber":"31966","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"55","citationCount":"41","articleId":"1486248","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1986","subType":"IEEE Letter","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1486254,"authors":[{"name":"J.J.

The isolation results in remarkable reduction of the photo-leakage current to a value as low as 1/8000 times that in the conventional bulk transistors, implying the corresponding reduction of smear noise of the sensor. It is pointed out also that the parasitic capacitance of the vertical signal line in the SOI structure is reduced to a half value of that in the bulk structure. With the use of the large area seeding-region serving also as a photodiode region, a high-quality SOI film has been obtained by the laser recrystallization. The structure of the SOI image sensor is the hybrid integration of the SOI transistors and the bulk transistors. As a result, the video output signal of 50 pixels has been successfully obtained.","doi":"10.1109/IEDM.1986.191194","publicationTitle":"1986 International Electron Devices Meeting","displayPublicationTitle":"1986 International Electron Devices Meeting","pdfPath":"/iel5/9952/31972/01486452.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IEDM.1986.191194","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31972","startPage":"369","endPage":"372","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Smear-less SOI image sensor","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1486452","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Smear-less SOI image sensor","chronOrPublicationDate":"1986","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1486452/","conferenceDate":"7-10 Dec. 1986","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1986","dateOfInsertion":"09 August 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Smear-less SOI image sensor","confLoc":"Los Angeles, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"01486452.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.018308S","chronDate":"1986","isNumber":"31972","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9952","citationCount":"2","articleId":"1486452","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1986","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":1486459,"authors":[{"name":"Mong-Song Liang","affiliation":["Advanced Micro Devices, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA, USA"],"lastName":"Mong-Song Liang","id":"37420230800"},{"name":"S.

Less degradation was found under dynamic stress compared to static stress. Significant positive oxide charge detrapping was observed during dynamic field operation. The amount of positive charge detrapping follows a first order rate equation. Positive trapped charges at the anode induce oxide leakage current at low bias voltage and this leakage current can be suppressed by alternately reversing the stress polarity. Generation of interface states was only slightly reduced under dynamic stress. However, oxide time-to-breakdown and charge-to-breakdown were greatly improved under dynamic stressing. The experimental data support the model that oxide breakdown results from the build up of bulk charges instead of interface states generation.","doi":"10.1109/IEDM.1986.191201","publicationTitle":"1986 International Electron Devices Meeting","displayPublicationTitle":"1986 International Electron Devices Meeting","pdfPath":"/iel5/9952/31972/01486459.pdf","startPage":"394","endPage":"398","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IEDM.1986.191201","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31972","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Degradation of very thin gate oxide MOS devices under dynamic high field/Current stress","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1486459","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"1986","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1486459/","displayDocTitle":"Degradation of very thin gate oxide MOS devices under dynamic high field/Current stress","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1986","conferenceDate":"7-10 Dec. 1986","dateOfInsertion":"09 August 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Degradation of very thin gate oxide MOS devices under dynamic high field/Current stress","confLoc":"Los Angeles, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"01486459.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.033867S","chronDate":"1986","isNumber":"31972","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9952","citationCount":"35","articleId":"1486459","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1986","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1486475,"authors":[{"name":"J.A.

To date, there has been little progress toward developing such memory elements for the GaAs heterojunction field effect transistor (HIGFET) technology. Toward this goal, we have studied the long term retention of minority carriers in potential wells at the AlGaAs/GaAs interface. Using a deep depletion capacitance-voltage (C-V) technique, we have measured the storage time of holes at the AlAs interface in the dark as a function of temperature from 175 K to 77 K. Storage times are thermally activated, with an activation energy of 0.37 eV. At 77 K, the storage time is greater than 220 hours, or 9 days. Using an AlAs-GaAs superlattice barrier, we measure an activation energy of 0.17 eV and a storage time at 77 K of 34 hours. These times are far in excess of what is needed to construct a one-transistor dynamic RAM for the GaAs HIGFET technology.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["DRAM chips","Gallium arsenide","Energy storage","Random access memory","Capacitance-voltage characteristics","Energy measurement","Time measurement","Very large scale integration","Registers","Heterojunctions"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1486475","doi":"10.1109/IEDM.1986.191217","startPage":"452","endPage":"455","publicationTitle":"1986 International Electron Devices Meeting","displayPublicationTitle":"1986 International Electron Devices Meeting","pdfPath":"/iel5/9952/31972/01486475.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31972","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IEDM.1986.191217","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1486475/","displayDocTitle":"Development of a one transistor dynamic RAM for the AlGaAs/GaAs HIGFET technology","chronOrPublicationDate":"1986","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1986","dateOfInsertion":"09 August 2005","conferenceDate":"7-10 Dec. 1986","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Development of a one transistor dynamic RAM for the AlGaAs/GaAs HIGFET technology","confLoc":"Los Angeles, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"01486475.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.036885S","chronDate":"1986","isNumber":"31972","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9952","citationCount":"2","articleId":"1486475","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1986","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":1486482,"authors":[{"name":"J.F.

Effective funneling length was found to strongly depend on a memory cell size(pn-junction size)--\"size effect\", and a cell space--\"proximity effect\", as well as substrate impurity concentration. These results were also proven by experimental results. A new experimental method used here makes a good use of only one-bit cell with actual dimen tions and is very useful for determination of soft-error-rate(SER) and feasibility check of many candidates for mega-bit memory cells. Thus, based on these new findings of funneling phenomena, proposed simulation and experimental methods, it was found that a kind of scaling law for alpha-particle induced soft errors exists which determines the limitation of planar cells, stacked capacitor cells, and trench cells.","displayPublicationTitle":"1986 International Electron Devices Meeting","pdfPath":"/iel5/9952/31972/01486501.pdf","startPage":"542","endPage":"545","publicationTitle":"1986 International Electron Devices Meeting","doi":"10.1109/IEDM.1986.191243","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IEDM.1986.191243","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31972","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1486501","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The scaling law of alpha-particle induced soft errors for VLSI's","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Very large scale integration","Guidelines","Hot carrier effects","Discrete event simulation","Laboratories","Proximity effect","Impurities","Capacitors","Power supplies","Voltage"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1486501/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1986","displayDocTitle":"The scaling law of alpha-particle induced soft errors for VLSI's","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1986","dateOfInsertion":"09 August 2005","conferenceDate":"7-10 Dec. 1986","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The scaling law of alpha-particle induced soft errors for VLSI's","confLoc":"Los Angeles, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"01486501.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.031542S","chronDate":"1986","isNumber":"31972","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9952","citationCount":"18","articleId":"1486501","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1986","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1486514,"authors":[{"name":"S.K.

Furthermore, the gate oxide field in this region is favorable for hot-electron injection into the floating gate. As a result, a programming speed of 10 \u00b5s at a drain voltage of 5 volts has been demonstrated.

Simple scaling rules are used to predict the LNT performance of CMOS operational amplifier circuits designed for room-temperature operation. Measurements show that unity gain frequency and slew rate can be improved by the same amount as the mobility increase with no loss of stability if bias currents are properly controlled. We also show that room-temperature CMOS amplifier circuits can be redesigned for 77-K operation by reducing channel widths and compensation capacitor area, giving performance equal in most respects to that of unscaled circuits at room temperature. However, 1/f noise is degraded by such redesign. Similar considerations of NMOS amplifiers show that such circuits do not benefit greatly from operation at liquid-nitrogen temperature. To aid in studying the temperature dependence of the sheet resistance of diffused resistors, a computer program was developed based on available models for bulk mobility and carrier freeze-out. Accurate predictions require a temperature dependence for lattice scattering that differs from previously reported values.","doi":"10.1109/T-ED.1987.22893","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","pdfPath":"/iel5/16/31973/01486604.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/T-ED.1987.22893","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31973","startPage":"114","endPage":"123","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"MOSFET behavior and circuit considerations for analog applications at 77 K","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1486604","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"MOSFET behavior and circuit considerations for analog applications at 77 K","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1987","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1486604/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1987","isJournal":true,"volume":"34","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 1987","dateOfInsertion":"09 August 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"MOSFET behavior and circuit considerations for analog applications at 77 K","sourcePdf":"01486604.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.066399S","chronDate":"Jan 1987","isNumber":"31973","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"16","articleId":"1486604","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1987","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1486607,"authors":[{"name":"W.C.

The dc equations are accurate to about 1 percent of the maximum drain current. A simple but accurate interpolation formula for drain current as a function of gate-to-source voltage connects the square-law behavior just above pinchoff and the square-root law for larger values of the drain current. The ac equations, with charge-storage elements, describe the variation of the gate-to-source and gate-to-drain capacitances as the drain-to-source voltage approaches zero and when this voltage becomes negative. Under normal operating conditions the gate-to-source capacitance is much larger than the gate-to-drain capacitance. At zero drain-to-source voltage both capacitances are about equal. For negative drain-to-source voltages the original source acts like a drain and vice versa. Consequently the normally large gate-to-source capacitance becomes small and acts like a gate-to-drain capacitance. In order to model these effect it is necessary to realize that, contrary to conventional SPICE usage, there are no separate gate-to-source and gate-to-drain charges, but that there is only one gate Charge which is a function of gate-to-source and gate-to-drain voltages. The present treatment Of these capacitances permits simulations-in which the drain-to-source voltage reverses polarity, as occurs in pass-gate circuits.","doi":"10.1109/T-ED.1987.22902","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","pdfPath":"/iel5/16/31974/01486613.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/T-ED.1987.22902","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31974","startPage":"160","endPage":"169","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"GaAs FET device and circuit simulation in SPICE","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1486613","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"GaAs FET device and circuit simulation in SPICE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 1987","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1486613/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 1987","isJournal":true,"volume":"34","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Feb. 1987","dateOfInsertion":"09 August 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"GaAs FET device and circuit simulation in SPICE","sourcePdf":"01486613.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.036236S","chronDate":"Feb 1987","isNumber":"31974","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"271","articleId":"1486613","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1987","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1486620,"authors":[{"name":"C.M.

The MOSFET noise model used is simple yet more accurate than that used previously. The device equivalent circuit for noise is derived from first principles. We are thus able to optimize the amplifier sensitivity with respect to hot-carrier channel thermal noise in terms of the FET drain-to-source voltage and the effective channel length. The importance of drain-source overlap capacitance in determining amplifier sensitivity, which has hitherto not been formulated, is also quantified. It is thus concluded that in spite of hot-carrier noise effects, fine-line NMOS amplifiers designed for gigabit-rate applications will continue to see sensitivity improvement for effective channel lengths down into the quarter-micrometer range.

The extraction requires that the intrinsic transconductance of the device be calculated from the measured one, which is generally degraded by source and drain parasitic resistances. We have derived an equation that allows the calculation of the intrinsic transconductance of a FET from the measured transconductance, under the assumption that source and drain series resistances are independent of bias. The derivation does not assume zero drain conductance, nor does it involve any specific FET model. Therefore, the derived equation works in both saturation and linear regions of a FET, regardless of its channel length.

First, a thermal electron beam model for gun-design computer codes is presented. It is necessary to employ a thermal beam model for accurate determination of T-emittance at the beam waist (especially in diode and low-perveance guns). Next, the paper considers the beam capture problem. How the match between the beam and the periodic permanant magnet (PPM) focussing field affects T-emittance growth downstream is described. After this, the effect of tube length on beam transmission is considered. It is shown that T-emittance can grow downstream due to the transfer of nonlinear field energy to transverse beam motion (explaining the observed degradation in transmission in very long tubes). Finally, at the exit of the tube, the grown value of T-emittance can be used as the basis for a spent beam model useful for preliminary single and multistage depressed collector (MDC) simulations. Appendices are presented which relate the quantities used in this paper to those used within the high-energy physics community.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 1987","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1486660/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 1987","volume":"34","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Feb. 1987","dateOfInsertion":"09 August 2005","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Emittance and the design of beam formation, transport, and collection systems in periodically focussed TWT's","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Emittance and the design of beam formation, transport, and collection systems in periodically focussed TWT's","sourcePdf":"01486660.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.043973S","chronDate":"Feb 1987","isNumber":"31974","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"27","articleId":"1486660","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1987","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1486668,"authors":[{"name":"W.M.

This is accomplished without area consuming contacts or metal straps, and without any extra deposition steps. In addition to providing a VLSI version of the buried-contact process, the technology permits the widespread use of self-aligned contacts and minimum geometry junctions. These features significantly reduce parasitic capacitance with the result that the signal propagation delay through a 1-\u00b5m CMOS inverter is decreased by 20- 25 percent.

A laser scanner system with a resolution of 12 \u00b5m \u00d7 20 \u00b5m has been utilized to generate the HOE's. Diffraction efficiency of the HOE and diffracted spot size have been measured. Stock lasers have been modified with a high-frequency package for interconnect experiments, and buried heterostructure fabrication techniques have been pursued. Measurements have been made on the fabricated photodetectors to determine dark current, responsivity and response time.

This memory cell consists of a pair of complementary MOSFET's and one capacitor. The PMOSFET is formed in an SOI film over the NMOSFET. Since both storage capacitor nodes are kept electrically floating in retention periods and one storage capacitor node is formed in a thin SOI film, an alpha-particle hit does not destroy the stored charge of this memory cell. It is sufficient for an SOI-PMOSFET to provide only three orders of magnitude ON/OFF current ratio. Experimental memory cells were fabricated using polysilicon film as an SOI film. Measuring them confirmed the main effectiveness of this memory cell.","doi":"10.1109/T-ED.1987.23093","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/T-ED.1987.23093","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","pdfPath":"/iel5/16/31978/01486804.pdf","startPage":"1368","endPage":"1372","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31978","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A new soft-error-immune DRAM cell using a stacked CMOS structure","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1486804/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1987","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1987","displayDocTitle":"A new soft-error-immune DRAM cell using a stacked CMOS structure","volume":"34","issue":"6","dateOfInsertion":"09 August 2005","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"June 1987","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new soft-error-immune DRAM cell using a stacked CMOS structure","sourcePdf":"01486804.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.031022S","chronDate":"Jun 1987","isNumber":"31978","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"3","articleId":"1486804","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1987","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1486816,"authors":[{"name":"H.

We have solved the wave equation of the MODFET, which automatically accounts for the propagation delay, capacitances, and charging resistances. Using a frequency power series proposed by Ziel, we derive an approximate analytic expression for the four intrinsic Y parameters. We verify that the truncated frequency power expansion used is accurate for frequencies up to twice the unilateral power-gain cutoff-frequency. The Y parameters derived hold from the threshold region to the edge of saturation. The theory was used to reproduce the dc characteristics of a 1-\u03bcm GaAlAs/GaAs MODFET together with its microwave characteristics measured from 2 to 18.4 GHz. Device parameters so obtained by fitting the I-V characteristics were used to calculate the MODFET Y parameters. They yield a closer fit to the data than the Y parameters obtained from conventional equivalent-circuit models. A reasonable prediction of the scattering parameters measured from 2 to 18.4 GHz is achieved with those device parameters. Further improvements can be obtained by optimizing the parasitics.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","pdfPath":"/iel5/16/31981/01486887.pdf","startPage":"1919","endPage":"1928","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","doi":"10.1109/T-ED.1987.23176","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/T-ED.1987.23176","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31981","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1486887","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis of MODFET microwave characteristics","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1486887/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1987","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1987","displayDocTitle":"Analysis of MODFET microwave characteristics","volume":"34","issue":"9","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 1987","dateOfInsertion":"09 August 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis of MODFET microwave characteristics","sourcePdf":"01486887.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.026174S","chronDate":"Sep 1987","isNumber":"31981","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"25","articleId":"1486887","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1987","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1486892,"authors":[{"name":"Y.

This effect is modeled using a novel 3-D analytical solution of the continuity equation. The model enables the full 3-D analysis of lateral transport as manifested in excess carrier distribution, photocurrent, and self- and cross-responsivities. Three detector structures are investigated: the semi-infinite substrate, the perfectly collecting, and the perfectly reflecting backside. The front and rear illuminations are treated. The calculated results for the 3-D case deviate fundamentally from those predicted by the 1-D model. The 3-D model succeeds in explaining the reduced quantum efficiency of small-area detectors. It also predicts the limited effect diffusion length has on self-responsivity and cut-off wavelength. The calculated spectral responses fit extremely well data measured on InSb and HgCdTe test arrays. As a powerful design tool, the model enables optimizing responsivity and crosstalk by varying element geometry and spacing, optical aperture, lifetime, and spectral range. The model can be applied to any semiconductor photodiode array provided the relevant physical and geometrical parameters are known.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Three-dimensional analytical simulation of self- and cross-responsivities of photovoltaic detector arrays","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","doi":"10.1109/T-ED.1987.23199","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","pdfPath":"/iel5/16/31982/01486910.pdf","startPage":"2059","endPage":"2070","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/T-ED.1987.23199","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31982","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1486910","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1486910/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1987","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1987","displayDocTitle":"Three-dimensional analytical simulation of self- and cross-responsivities of photovoltaic detector arrays","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"34","issue":"10","dateOfInsertion":"09 August 2005","publicationDate":"Oct. 1987","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Three-dimensional analytical simulation of self- and cross-responsivities of photovoltaic detector arrays","sourcePdf":"01486910.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.040206S","chronDate":"Oct 1987","isNumber":"31982","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"21","articleId":"1486910","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1987","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":1486926,"authors":[{"name":"S.

The peaks are generated using only the ground state resonance of the quantum well rather than several states, as in conventional RT devices. The separation between the peaks is voltage tunable and also the peak currents can be made nearly equal, which is necessary to use the device in a variety of circuit applications. A functional device operating at 100 K, with two peaks in the I-V has been fabricated. The first practical demonstration of circuits for frequency multiplication by a factor of five, a three-state memory and a 4-bit parity generator, using a single functional RT device each, is also reported. The use of multiple-peak RT devices in these circuits results in an order of magnitude reduction in the number component per function over conventional techniques.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Resonant tunneling device with multiple negative differential resistance: Digital and signal processing applications with reduced circuit complexity","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","doi":"10.1109/T-ED.1987.23215","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","pdfPath":"/iel5/16/31982/01486926.pdf","startPage":"2185","endPage":"2191","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/T-ED.1987.23215","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31982","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1486926","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1486926/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1987","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1987","displayDocTitle":"Resonant tunneling device with multiple negative differential resistance: Digital and signal processing applications with reduced circuit complexity","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"34","issue":"10","dateOfInsertion":"09 August 2005","publicationDate":"Oct. 1987","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Resonant tunneling device with multiple negative differential resistance: Digital and signal processing applications with reduced circuit complexity","sourcePdf":"01486926.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.0331S","chronDate":"Oct 1987","isNumber":"31982","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"48","articleId":"1486926","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1987","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1486935,"authors":[{"name":"K.S.

The entire structure is grown lattice-matched to InP continuously by molecular-beam epitaxy in a single step. Rapid thermal annealing of implanted semiconductors and ohmic contacts have been investigated and have been used successfully in the fabrication of the MISFET's. Improved performance is obtained with the incorporation of Ti in the source-drain metallization, with which contact resistances as low as 0.1 \u03c9 . mm are measured. Charge-control modeling of the proposed device predicts the carrier concentration in the channel region fairly well at room temperature. A quantum mechanical modeling of the device in the effective mass approximation also has been done. The thickness of the InAlAs doping layer is found to be an important parameter that controls the device turn-on characteristics. The velocity-field characteristics of the two-dimensional channel electrons were measured by pulse current-voltage and pulsed Hall techniques.

This memory is programmed by channel hot-electron injection and the charges are stored in the oxide-nitride-oxide (ONO) gate dielectric. Erasing is accomplished in milliseconds by applying a positive voltage to the drain plus an optional negative voltage to the gate causing electron tunneling and/or hot-hole injection due to the deep-depletion-mode drain breakdown. Since the injection and storage of electrons and holes are confined to a short region near the drain, the part of the channel near the source maintains the original positive threshold voltage even after repeated erase operation. Therefore a select transistor, separate or integral, is not needed. Because oxide layers with a thickness larger than 60 \u00c5 are used, this device has much better data retention characteristics than conventional MNOS memory cells.

In this situation it is found that the dependence of the unilateral gain on frequency can be significantly different from the simple 6-dB/octave decrease usually assumed. It is found that the device exhibits negative output conductance over certain bands of frequencies, and that when this occurs a series of resonances are observed in the gain versus frequency characteristics. Explanations of this behavior are given in terms of the phase delay of the common-base current gain.

The voltage divider is a new concept in SEU hardening and has practical value for technologies where the voltage transient duration is significantly different for responses to ion strikes at p- and n-channel drains. In combination, the two pairs of resistors allow much reduced resistor values with the advantage of faster access times, better temperature stability, and better scalability. Advanced simulations in which transport and circuit effects are modeled simultaneously are used to project the viability of the LRAM concept and data from single-cell test structures and support the analysis.","doi":"10.1109/EDL.1987.26720","publicationTitle":"IEEE Electron Device Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Electron Device Letters","pdfPath":"/iel5/55/31995/01487270.pdf","startPage":"537","endPage":"539","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EDL.1987.26720","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31995","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1487270","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A proposed new structure for SEU immunity in SRAM employing drain resistance","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1987","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1987","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1487270/","displayDocTitle":"A proposed new structure for SEU immunity in SRAM employing drain resistance","volume":"8","issue":"11","publicationDate":"Nov. 1987","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"09 August 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A proposed new structure for SEU immunity in SRAM employing drain resistance","sourcePdf":"01487270.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.02685S","chronDate":"Nov 1987","isNumber":"31995","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"55","citationCount":"12","articleId":"1487270","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1987","subType":"IEEE Letter","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":1487272,"authors":[{"name":"J.G.

Stable periods last from seconds to hours and are punctuated by nearly instantaneous transitions. Electrical characterization of VHT bits show increased transition rates with temperature and substrate bias. Physical investigation usually uncovers a silicon material defect present in the offending cell.

As a result, a circuit performance degradation due to hot electron can be simulated and the MOSFETs which results in this degradation can be identified.","displayPublicationTitle":"1987 International Electron Devices Meeting","pdfPath":"/iel5/9953/31997/01487427.pdf","startPage":"498","endPage":"501","publicationTitle":"1987 International Electron Devices Meeting","doi":"10.1109/IEDM.1987.191469","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IEDM.1987.191469","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31997","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1487427","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Circuit hot electron effect simulation","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Electrons","Circuit simulation","Degradation","MOSFETs","Stress","Circuit optimization","Substrates","Threshold voltage","Process design","Instruments"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1487427/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1987","displayDocTitle":"Circuit hot electron effect simulation","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1987","dateOfInsertion":"09 August 2005","conferenceDate":"6-9 Dec. 1987","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Circuit hot electron effect simulation","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"01487427.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.025743S","chronDate":"1987","isNumber":"31997","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9953","citationCount":"56","articleId":"1487427","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1987","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1487432,"authors":[{"name":"S.

Although the 1-\u00b5m twin-tub process is inherently more tolerant than the p-well process to soft errors, the densely packed 1-\u00b5m memory cells become very soft because of the dominant effect of the channel width reduction. An advanced device-plus-circuit simulator was used to calculate the differential contribution from each of the vertical and lateral dimensional changes involved in the technology transition. Good agreement between the simulations and the experimental data is reached by properly correcting the 2D model to account for the phenomenal saturation effect involving very heavy ions.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31997","publicationTitle":"1987 International Electron Devices Meeting","displayPublicationTitle":"1987 International Electron Devices Meeting","pdfPath":"/iel5/9953/31997/01487440.pdf","doi":"10.1109/IEDM.1987.191482","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IEDM.1987.191482","startPage":"540","endPage":"543","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Scaling studies of CMOS SRAM soft-error tolerances - From 16K to 256K","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-9 Dec. 1987","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1487440/","displayDocTitle":"Scaling studies of CMOS SRAM soft-error tolerances - From 16K to 256K","conferenceDate":"6-9 Dec. 1987","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"09 August 2005","publicationDate":"1987","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Scaling studies of CMOS SRAM soft-error tolerances - From 16K to 256K","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"01487440.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060127S","chronDate":"6-9 Dec. 1987","isNumber":"31997","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9953","citationCount":"10","articleId":"1487440","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1987","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-01"},{"_id":1487441,"authors":[{"name":"J.S.

This may set another constraint for the power supply voltage and/or oxide thickness in VLSI MOSFET scaling Device design considerations for minimizing the gate-induced drain leakage current are discussed.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1487489/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1987","publicationDate":"1987","conferenceDate":"6-9 Dec. 1987","dateOfInsertion":"09 August 2005","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"The impact of gate-induced drain leakage current on MOSFET scaling","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The impact of gate-induced drain leakage current on MOSFET scaling","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"01487489.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051968S","chronDate":"1987","isNumber":"31997","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9953","citationCount":"186","articleId":"1487489","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1987","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1487493,"authors":[{"name":"G.

Those constraints make the problem hard. Omitting the constraints and solving the unconstrained problem results in a placement with substantial cell overlaps. To remove the overlaps, we introduce fixed points into the nonconstrained quadratic-programming formulation. Acting as pseudocells at fixed locations, they can be used to pull cells away from the dense regions to reduce overlapping. We present an in-depth study of the placement technique based on fixed-point addition and prove that fixed points are generalizations of constant additional forces used previously to eliminate cell overlaps. Experimental results on public-domain benchmarks show that the fixed-point-addition-based placer produces better results than the placer based on constant additional forces. We present an efficient multilevel placer based upon the fixed-point technique and demonstrate that it produces competitive results compared to the existing state-of-the-art placers.","doi":"10.1109/TCAD.2005.850802","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/43/31998/01487559.pdf","startPage":"1188","endPage":"1203","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCAD.2005.850802","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31998","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multilevel fixed-point-addition-based VLSI placement","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 July 2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1487559/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2005","displayDocTitle":"Multilevel fixed-point-addition-based VLSI placement","dateOfInsertion":"25 July 2005","htmlLink":"/document/1487559/","accessionNumber":"8513049","volume":"24","issue":"8","publicationDate":"Aug. 2005","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multilevel fixed-point-addition-based VLSI placement","sourcePdf":"01487559.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.083969S","chronDate":"Aug.  2005","xplore-pub-id":"43","isNumber":"31998","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"31998","articleId":"1487559","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":1487578,"authors":[{"name":"Xuejun Tan","affiliation":["Center for Research in Intelligent Systems, University of California, Riverside, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5326/31999/1487578/1487578-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Xuejun Tan received the B.S. degree in automation from Tian Jin University, Tian Jin, China, in 1995, the M.S. degree in pattern recognition and artificial intelligence from the Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China, in 1998, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from the University of California, Riverside, in 2003.","Dr. Tan's research interests include biometrics, image processing, pattern recognition, and machine learning."]},"lastName":"Xuejun Tan","id":"37087159670"},{"name":"B.

Starting with the Eigenface-Algorithm, different eigenspace-based approaches for the recognition of faces have been proposed. They differ mostly in the kind of projection method used (standard, differential, or kernel eigenspace), in the projection algorithm employed, in the use of simple or differential images before/after projection, and in the similarity matching criterion or classification method employed. The aim of this paper is to present an independent comparative study among some of the main eigenspace-based approaches. We believe that carrying out independent studies is relevant, since comparisons are normally performed using the implementations of the research groups that have proposed each method, which does not consider completely equal working conditions for the algorithms. Very often, a contest between the abilities of the research groups rather than a comparison between methods is performed. This study considers theoretical aspects as well as simulations performed using the Yale Face Database, a database with few classes and several images per class, and FERET, a database with many classes and few images per class.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part C (Applications and Reviews)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5326/31999/01487580.pdf","startPage":"315","endPage":"325","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part C (Applications and Reviews)","doi":"10.1109/TSMCC.2005.848201","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSMCC.2005.848201","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31999","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1487580","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Eigenspace-based face recognition: a comparative study of different approaches","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Face recognition","Kernel","Projection algorithms","Image databases","Employee welfare","Spatial databases","Biometrics","Principal component analysis","Image recognition","Digital images"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["face recognition","eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","visual databases","image matching","image classification"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["eigenspace-based face recognition","digital image similarity matching","projection algorithm","Yale Face Database","FERET"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Eigenfaces","eigenspace-based analysis","face recognition","face recognition algorithms' comparisons"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1487580/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2005","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 July 2005","displayDocTitle":"Eigenspace-based face recognition: a comparative study of different approaches","volume":"35","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/1487580/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2005","accessionNumber":"8507019","dateOfInsertion":"25 July 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Eigenspace-based face recognition: a comparative study of different approaches","sourcePdf":"01487580.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.119998S","chronDate":"Aug.  2005","xplore-pub-id":"5326","isNumber":"31999","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5326","citationCount":"98","xplore-issue":"31999","articleId":"1487580","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-20"},{"_id":1487582,"authors":[{"name":"S.T.V.

In this paper, we propose to combine the fingerprint and speaker verification decisions using a functional link network. This is to circumvent the nontrivial trial-and-error and iterative training effort as seen in backpropagation neural networks which cannot guarantee global optimal solutions. In many data fusion applications, as individual classifiers to be combined would have attained a certain level of classification accuracy, the proposed functional link network can be used to combine these classifiers by taking their outputs as the inputs to the network. The proposed network is first applied to a pattern recognition problem to illustrate its approximation capability. The network is then used to combine the fingerprint and speaker verification decisions with much improved receiver operating characteristics performance as compared to several decision fusion methods from the literature.","doi":"10.1109/TSMCC.2005.848184","pdfPath":"/iel5/5326/31999/01487584.pdf","startPage":"357","endPage":"370","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part C (Applications and Reviews)","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part C (Applications and Reviews)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSMCC.2005.848184","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31999","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fingerprint and speaker verification decisions fusion using a functional link network","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1487584/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2005","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 July 2005","displayDocTitle":"Fingerprint and speaker verification decisions fusion using a functional link network","volume":"35","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"25 July 2005","accessionNumber":"8507023","publicationDate":"Aug. 2005","htmlLink":"/document/1487584/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fingerprint and speaker verification decisions fusion using a functional link network","sourcePdf":"01487584.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.071238S","chronDate":"Aug.  2005","xplore-pub-id":"5326","isNumber":"31999","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5326","citationCount":"25","xplore-issue":"31999","articleId":"1487584","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":1487586,"authors":[{"name":"G.

Usually, input data of the network are composed by past measurements of flows and rainfalls, without providing a description of the saturation state of the basin, which, in contrast, plays a key role in the rainfall-runoff process. This paper couples neural networks and fuzzy logic in order to enrich the description of the basin saturation state for flood forecasting purposes. The basin state is assessed analyzing the total rainfall occurred on a certain time window before the flood event. The proposed framework first classifies the basin saturation state providing a set of fuzzy memberships, and then issues the forecast exploiting a set of neural predictors, each specialized on certain basin saturation condition by means of a weighted least-square training algorithm. The outputs of the specialized neural predictors are linearly weighted, according to the basin state at forecast time: The more the training conditions of a predictor matches the current basin saturation state, the higher its weight on the final forecast. The framework has been tested on an Italian catchment and may overperform classical neural networks approaches.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1487586/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 July 2005","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"8507025","volume":"35","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/1487586/","publicationDate":"Aug. 2005","dateOfInsertion":"25 July 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Coupling fuzzy modeling and neural networks for river flood prediction","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Coupling fuzzy modeling and neural networks for river flood prediction","sourcePdf":"01487586.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.099369S","chronDate":"Aug.  2005","xplore-pub-id":"5326","isNumber":"31999","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5326","citationCount":"27","xplore-issue":"31999","articleId":"1487586","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1487590,"authors":[{"name":"J.

Image resolution is an important factor affecting face recognition by human and computer. In this paper, we propose a new face hallucination method using eigentransformation. Different from most of the proposed methods based on probabilistic models, this method views hallucination as a transformation between different image styles. We use Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to fit the input face image as a linear combination of the low-resolution face images in the training set. The high-resolution image is rendered by replacing the low-resolution training images with high-resolution ones, while retaining the same combination coefficients. Experiments show that the hallucinated face images are not only very helpful for recognition by humans, but also make the automatic recognition procedure easier, since they emphasize the face difference by adding more high-frequency details.","doi":"10.1109/TSMCC.2005.848171","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part C (Applications and Reviews)","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part C (Applications and Reviews)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5326/31999/01487591.pdf","startPage":"425","endPage":"434","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSMCC.2005.848171","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=31999","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hallucinating face by eigentransformation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1487591","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 July 2005","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1487591/","displayDocTitle":"Hallucinating face by eigentransformation","volume":"35","issue":"3","publicationDate":"Aug. 2005","accessionNumber":"8507030","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1487591/","dateOfInsertion":"25 July 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hallucinating face by eigentransformation","sourcePdf":"01487591.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.089408S","chronDate":"Aug.  2005","xplore-pub-id":"5326","isNumber":"31999","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5326","citationCount":"325","xplore-issue":"31999","articleId":"1487591","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1487602,"authors":[{"name":"H.Y.

We describe a novel current-mode algorithm that also uses time to perform analog-to-digital conversion but requires 5N clock cycles to achieve N bits of precision via a successive subranging technique. The algorithm requires one asynchronous comparator, two capacitors, one current source, and a state machine. Amplification of two is achieved without the use of an explicit amplifier by simply doing things twice in time. The use of alternating voltage-to-time and time-to-voltage conversions provides natural error cancellation of comparator offset and delay, 1/f noise, and switching charge-injection. The use of few components and an efficient mechanism for amplification and error cancellation allow for energy-efficient operation: in a 0.35-/spl mu/m implementation, we were able to achieve 12 bit of DNL limited precision or 11 bit of thermal noise-limited precision at a sampling frequency of 31.25 kHz with 75 /spl mu/W of total analog and digital power consumption.

Its reduced input capacitance decreases the capacitive load at the output of the fully differential amplifier, improving its achievable gain-bandwidth (GBW) product and slew rate. This topology is more suitable for high-speed switched-capacitor applications when compared to a conventional switched-capacitor CMFB, enabling operation at higher clock frequencies. Additionally, it provides a superior rejection to the negative power supply noise (PSRR/sup -/). The performance of the CMFB is demonstrated in the implementation of a second-order 10.7-MHz bandpass switched-capacitor filter and compared with that of an identical filter using the conventional switched-capacitor CMFB (SC-CMFB). The filter using the continuous-time CMFB reduces the error due to finite GBW and slew rate to less than 1% for clock frequencies up to 72 MHz while providing a dynamic range of 59 dB and a PSRR/sup -/>22 dB. Both circuits were fabricated in 0.35-/spl mu/m CMOS technology.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1487604/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 2005","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 July 2005","htmlLink":"/document/1487604/","dateOfInsertion":"25 July 2005","publicationDate":"Aug. 2005","accessionNumber":"8507622","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"40","issue":"8","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Continuous-time common-mode feedback for high-speed switched-capacitor networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Continuous-time common-mode feedback for high-speed switched-capacitor networks","sourcePdf":"01487604.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.052357S","chronDate":"Aug. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"4","isNumber":"32000","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"28","xplore-issue":"32000","articleId":"1487604","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":1487605,"authors":[{"name":"Xin He","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Kansas State University, Manhattan, KS, USA","Philips Research East Asia, Shanghai, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4/32000/1487605/1487605-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Xin He received the B.S. and M.E. degrees in instrumentation from the University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, China, in 1997 and 2000, respectively, and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from Kansas State University, Manhattan, in 2002 and 2004, respectively.","In the summer of 2004, he joined Philips Research East Asia, Shanghai, China, as a Senior Research Scientist.

To achieve fast loop settling, integer-N architecture that operates with 528-MHz reference frequency is implemented and a wideband active-loop filter is integrated. An improved phase-frequency detector (PFD) is proposed for faster loop settling. To reduce reference sidebands, a feedback circuit using replica bias is implemented in the charge pump. I/Q carriers are generated by two cross-coupled LC VCOs. The output current of the charge pump is controlled to compensate for the VCO gain nonlinearity and a programmable frequency divider (12/spl les/N/spl les/17) that reliably operates at 9 GHz is designed.

While incurring little or no increase in the number of links, the proposed encoding scheme overcomes two major problems in single-ended parallel links-reference ambiguity and power-line fluctuations. The proposed scheme transmits differentially encoded data among the pins and adjusts the driving current to be constant so as to minimize the L(di/dt) switching noise on the output driver power lines. A new precentering scheme is also applied to maximize the horizontal eye opening by centering all signals during a predefined time before the start of the next symbol transition. To verify the proposed schemes, a transceiver chip was designed and fabricated in 0.25-/spl mu/m CMOS technology. The chip, which consists of 18 parallel links with only three ground and three supply pins for the output drivers, employs a three-level differential encoding scheme to achieve a maximum data rate of 1.8 Gb/s with a bit error rate of less than 10/sup -12/.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSSC.2005.852010","doi":"10.1109/JSSC.2005.852010","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel5/4/32000/01487613.pdf","startPage":"1688","endPage":"1694","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=32000","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multilevel differential encoding with precentering for high-speed parallel link transceiver","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Multilevel differential encoding with precentering for high-speed parallel link transceiver","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1487613/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 2005","isJournal":true,"volume":"40","issue":"8","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2005","accessionNumber":"8507631","dateOfInsertion":"25 July 2005","htmlLink":"/document/1487613/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 July 2005","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multilevel differential encoding with precentering for high-speed parallel link transceiver","sourcePdf":"01487613.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.117587S","chronDate":"Aug. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"4","isNumber":"32000","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"32000","articleId":"1487613","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1487614,"authors":[{"name":"H.

The proposed soft-decision IC is composed of five functional blocks, i.e., a soft-decider, an error filter, a 3-bit encoder, a 3:48 de-multiplexer, and a clock recovery circuit. The biggest challenge was the soft-decision block regenerating the common data using seven deciders with separate thresholds. We employed a novel SiGe BiCMOS process and a custom BGA package made from low-temperature co-fired ceramics to achieve a high sensitivity of 20 mVpp with a wide phase margin of 270/spl deg/ for 12.4-Gb/s nonreturn-to-zero (NRZ) data signals. The error filter and the 3-bit encoder, which are incorporated in the IC, prevent the degradation of the FEC performance due to signal noise or fluctuations. The 3:48 de-multiplexer provides an accessible interface with the FEC encoder/decoder LSI. The clock recovery circuit, based on a phase-locked-loop technology, fulfilled the jitter tolerance requirements corresponding to ITU-T G.825, even for 55% duty cycle optical return-to-zero (RZ) signals.

The covariance matrix approach is used to deal with the nonreflection symmetric scattering case. This scheme includes and extends the three-component decomposition method introduced by Freeman and Durden dealing with the reflection symmetry condition that the co-pol and the cross-pol correlations are close to zero. Helix scattering power is added as the fourth component to the three-component scattering model which describes surface, double bounce, and volume scattering. This helix scattering term is added to take account of the co-pol and the cross-pol correlations which generally appear in complex urban area scattering and disappear for a natural distributed scatterer. This term is relevant for describing man-made targets in urban area scattering. In addition, asymmetric volume scattering covariance matrices are introduced in dependence of the relative backscattering magnitude between HH and VV. A modification of probability density function for a cloud of dipole scatterers yields asymmetric covariance matrices. An appropriate choice among the symmetric or asymmetric volume scattering covariance matrices allows us to make a best fit to the measured data. A four-component decomposition algorithm is developed to deal with a general scattering case. The result of this decomposition is demonstrated with L-band Pi-SAR images taken over the city of Niigata, Japan.","doi":"10.1109/TGRS.2005.852084","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel5/36/32001/01487628.pdf","startPage":"1699","endPage":"1706","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2005.852084","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=32001","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Four-component scattering model for polarimetric SAR image decomposition","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1487628","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 July 2005","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1487628/","displayDocTitle":"Four-component scattering model for polarimetric SAR image decomposition","volume":"43","issue":"8","publicationDate":"Aug. 2005","accessionNumber":"8507985","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1487628/","dateOfInsertion":"25 July 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Four-component scattering model for polarimetric SAR image decomposition","sourcePdf":"01487628.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.06974S","chronDate":"Aug. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"36","isNumber":"32001","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"780","xplore-issue":"32001","articleId":"1487628","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-29"},{"_id":1487657,"authors":[{"name":"R.G.

DA uses bit-serial operations and look-up tables (LUTs) to implement high throughput filters that use only about one cycle per bit of resolution regardless of filter length. However, building adaptive DA filters requires recalculating the LUTs for each adaptation which can negate any performance advantages of DA filtering. By using an auxiliary LUT with special addressing, the efficiency and throughput of DA adaptive filters can be of the same order as fixed DA filters. In this paper, we discuss a new hardware adaptive filter structure for very high throughput LMS adaptive filters. We describe the development of DA adaptive filters and show that practical implementations of DA adaptive filters have very high throughput relative to multiply and accumulate architectures. We also show that DA adaptive filters have a potential area and power consumption advantage over digital signal processing microprocessor architectures.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1487661/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 July 2005","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2005","volume":"52","issue":"7","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"8509936","dateOfInsertion":"25 July 2005","publicationDate":"July 2005","htmlLink":"/document/1487661/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"LMS adaptive filters using distributed arithmetic for high throughput","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"LMS adaptive filters using distributed arithmetic for high throughput","sourcePdf":"01487661.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.108933S","chronDate":"July  2005","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"32002","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"90","xplore-issue":"32002","articleId":"1487661","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":1487662,"authors":[{"name":"Sizhong Chen","affiliation":["Electrical, Computer and Systems Engineering, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Troy, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8919/32002/1487662/1487662-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Sizhong Chen received the B.

In the conventional synchronous design regime, such throughput/performance tradeoff is typically fixed since the pipeline depth is usually determined in the design phase and remains unchanged in the run time. Nevertheless, in many real-life scenarios, the overall system performance can be potentially improved if we can run-time dynamically configure this tradeoff. With this motivation, we propose to apply self-timed pipeline, an alternative to synchronous pipeline, to implement the pipelined adaptive signal processing systems, in which the pipeline depth can be dynamically changed to realize run-time configurable throughput/performance tradeoffs. Based on a well-known high speed self-timed pipeline style, we developed architecture and circuit level design techniques to implement the self-timed pipelined adaptation feedback loop with configurable pipeline depth. We demonstrate the proposed design approach using a delayed least mean square (DLMS) adaptive equalizer for magnetic recording read channel. The data transfer rate in hard disk varies as the read head moves among tracks with different distance from the center of the disk platter. By adjusting the pipeline depth on-the-fly, the DLMS equalizer can dynamically track the best equalization performance allowed by the varying data transfer rates. Simulation result shows a significant performance improvement compared with its synchronous counterpart.","doi":"10.1109/TCSI.2005.851694","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSI.2005.851694","startPage":"1338","endPage":"1347","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","pdfPath":"/iel5/8919/32002/01487662.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=32002","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Self-timed dynamically pipelined adaptive signal processing system: a case study of DLMS equalizer for read channel","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1487662/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July 2005","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 July 2005","displayDocTitle":"Self-timed dynamically pipelined adaptive signal processing system: a case study of DLMS equalizer for read channel","volume":"52","issue":"7","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"25 July 2005","accessionNumber":"8519389","publicationDate":"July 2005","htmlLink":"/document/1487662/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Self-timed dynamically pipelined adaptive signal processing system: a case study of DLMS equalizer for read channel","sourcePdf":"01487662.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.056218S","chronDate":"July 2005","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"32002","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"32002","articleId":"1487662","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":1487663,"authors":[{"name":"G.

Posibits, or simply bits, in {0,1} and negabits in {-1,0}, commonly used in two's-complement representations and (n,p) encoding of binary signed digits, are special cases of twits. A weighted bit-set (WBS) encoding, which generalizes the two's-complement encoding by allowing one or more posibits and/or negabits in each radix-2 position, has been shown to unify many efficient implementations of redundant number systems. A collection of equally weighted twits, including ones with noncontiguous values (e.g., {-1,1} or {0,2}), can lead to wider representation range without the added storage and interconnection costs associated with multivalued digit sets. We present weighted twit-set (WTS) encodings as a generalization of WBS encodings, examine key properties of this new class of encodings, and show that any redundant number system (e.g., generalized signed-digit and hybrid-redundant systems), including those that are based on noncontiguous and/or zero-excluded digit sets, is faithfully representable by WTS encoding. We highlight this broad coverage by a tree chart having WTS representations at its root and various useful redundant representations at its many internal nodes and leaves. We further examine how highly optimized conventional components such as standard full/half-adders and compressors may be used for arithmetic on WTS-encoded operands, thus allowing highly efficient and VLSI-friendly circuit implementations. For example, focusing on the WBS-like subclass of WTS encodings, we describe a twit-based implementation of a particular stored-transfer representation which offers area and speed advantages over other similar designs based on WBS and hybrid-redundant representations.","doi":"10.1109/TCSI.2005.851679","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","pdfPath":"/iel5/8919/32002/01487663.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSI.2005.851679","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=32002","startPage":"1348","endPage":"1357","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Weighted two-valued digit-set encodings: unifying efficient hardware representation schemes for redundant number systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1487663","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Weighted two-valued digit-set encodings: unifying efficient hardware representation schemes for redundant number systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"July 2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1487663/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 July 2005","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"52","issue":"7","publicationDate":"July 2005","accessionNumber":"8509937","dateOfInsertion":"25 July 2005","htmlLink":"/document/1487663/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Weighted two-valued digit-set encodings: unifying efficient hardware representation schemes for redundant number systems","sourcePdf":"01487663.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.088678S","chronDate":"July 2005","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"32002","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"28","xplore-issue":"32002","articleId":"1487663","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1487664,"authors":[{"name":"G.

We define real-time visual MTT as the task of tracking targets contained in an input image flow at a sampling-rate that is higher than the speed of the fastest maneuvers that the targets make. We utilize a sensor-processor based on the cellular neural network universal machine architecture that permits the offloading of the main image processing tasks from the DSP and introduces opportunities for sensor adaptation based on the tracking performance feedback from the DSP. To achieve robustness, the image processing algorithms running on the sensor borrow ideas from biological systems: the input is processed in different parallel channels (spatial, spatio-temporal and temporal) and the interaction of these channels generates the measurements for the digital tracking algorithms. These algorithms (running on the DSP) are responsible for distance calculation, state estimation, data association and track maintenance. The performance of the proposed system is studied using actual hardware for different video flows containing rapidly moving maneuvering targets.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1487664/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 July 2005","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","publicationDate":"July 2005","accessionNumber":"8519390","htmlLink":"/document/1487664/","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"25 July 2005","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"52","issue":"7","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A real-time multitarget tracking system with robust multichannel CNN-UM algorithms","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A real-time multitarget tracking system with robust multichannel CNN-UM algorithms","sourcePdf":"01487664.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.090011S","chronDate":"July  2005","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"32002","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"32002","articleId":"1487664","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1487666,"authors":[{"name":"P.

Indeed, they enjoy some nice chaotic properties, which seem to be suitable for use in Cryptography. Moreover, they satisfy a semi-group property, which makes possible implementing a trapdoor mechanism. In this paper, we study a public-key cryptosystem based on such polynomials, which provides both encryption and digital signature. The cryptosystem works on real numbers and is quite efficient. Unfortunately, from our analysis, it comes up that it is not secure. We describe an attack which permits to recover the corresponding plaintext from a given ciphertext. The same attack can be applied to produce forgeries if the cryptosystem is used for signing messages. Then, we point out that also other primitives, a Diffie-Hellman like key agreement scheme and an authentication scheme, designed along the same lines of the cryptosystem, are not secure due to the aforementioned attack. We close the paper by discussing the issues and the possibilities of constructing public-key cryptosystems on real numbers.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 July 2005","chronOrPublicationDate":"July 2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1487666/","volume":"52","issue":"7","htmlLink":"/document/1487666/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"8509939","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"July 2005","dateOfInsertion":"25 July 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Security of public-key cryptosystems based on Chebyshev polynomials","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Security of public-key cryptosystems based on Chebyshev polynomials","sourcePdf":"01487666.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.105034S","chronDate":"July 2005","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"32002","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"190","xplore-issue":"32002","articleId":"1487666","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":1487667,"authors":[{"name":"S.J.M. de Almeida","affiliation":["The Escola de Engenharia e Arquitetura, Universidade Cat\u00f3lica de Pelotas, Pelotas, Brazil"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8919/32002/1487667/1487667-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["S\u00e9rgio J.

This method takes advantage of the strong correlation between the width of the undisturbed light-distribution in continuous crystals and the /spl gamma/-ray's DOI. In order to quantify the dependence of the distribution's width with respect to the DOI, we first studied an analytical model of the light-distribution and tested it by means of Monte Carlo (MC) simulations of the light transport inside the crystal. Further we present an inexpensive modification of the commonly used charge division circuit that allows analog and instantaneous computation of the light-distribution's second moment without affecting the determination of the centroid. This redesigned resistor network is based on the position-sensitive proportional counter (DPC) readout and allows, together with position sensitive photo-detectors, the additional measurement of the light-distribution's standard-deviation /spl sigma/. We tested the proposed circuit using the design-tool OrCAD and found the signal sufficiently large for digitalization. Finally, we conducted MC simulations of a realistic Positron Emission Tomography (PET) detector module setup that mimic a continuous Lu/sub 2/SiO/sub 5/:Ce/sup 3+/ (LSO) crystal of dimensions 40/spl times/40/spl times/10 mm/sup 3/ together with the new large area position-sensitive photo multiplier tube (PSPMT) H8500 from Hamamatsu.

For this reason, manufacturers of equipment for medical computed tomography (CT) rely mostly on special application specified integrated circuits (ASICs) to obtain the fast reconstruction times required in clinical settings. Although modern CPUs have gained sufficient power in recent years to be competitive for two-dimensional (2D) reconstruction, this is not the case for three-dimensional (3D) reconstructions, especially not when iterative algorithms must be applied. The recent evolution of commodity PC computer graphics boards (GPUs) has the potential to change this picture in a very dramatic way. In this paper we will show how the new floating point GPUs can be exploited to perform both analytical and iterative reconstruction from X-ray and functional imaging data. For this purpose, we decompose three popular three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction algorithms (Feldkamp filtered backprojection, the simultaneous algebraic reconstruction technique, and expectation maximization) into a common set of base modules, which all can be executed on the GPU and their output linked internally. Visualization of the reconstructed object is easily achieved since the object already resides in the graphics hardware, allowing one to run a visualization module at any time to view the reconstruction results. Our implementation allows speedups of over an order of magnitude with respect to CPU implementations, at comparable image quality.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1487696/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 July 2005","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","publicationDate":"June 2005","accessionNumber":"8516188","htmlLink":"/document/1487696/","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"25 July 2005","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"52","issue":"3","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Accelerating popular tomographic reconstruction algorithms on commodity PC graphics hardware","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Accelerating popular tomographic reconstruction algorithms on commodity PC graphics hardware","sourcePdf":"01487696.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.101352S","chronDate":"June 2005","xplore-pub-id":"23","isNumber":"32003","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"153","xplore-issue":"32003","articleId":"1487696","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1487713,"authors":[{"name":"M.

Such CNN model will be more valuable when a considerable decrease in weight and size of control system is required (e.g., in space nuclear fission reactors).","doi":"10.1109/TNS.2005.852617","startPage":"719","endPage":"728","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNS.2005.852617","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=32004","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","pdfPath":"/iel5/23/32004/01487713.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Simulation of nuclear reactor core kinetics using multilayer 3-D cellular neural networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1487713/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Simulation of nuclear reactor core kinetics using multilayer 3-D cellular neural networks","volume":"52","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/1487713/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"8507712","publicationDate":"June 2005","dateOfInsertion":"25 July 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 2005","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 July 2005","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Simulation of nuclear reactor core kinetics using multilayer 3-D cellular neural networks","sourcePdf":"01487713.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.073448S","chronDate":"June 2005","xplore-pub-id":"23","isNumber":"32004","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"32004","articleId":"1487713","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1487717,"authors":[{"name":"K.

MATLAB is used to generate a set of representative noise signals, which are imported into HSPICE for simulation. Once the simulations are complete the results are read back into MATLAB and ensemble statistics are calculated. The MATLAB-generated noise signals have a user-defined white-noise floor and flicker-noise corner frequency and thus are suitable for modeling a wide variety of electronic components, including CMOS transistors and resistors.

The peak directivity of a monopole antenna with a finite ground plane, such as a circular or rectangular ground plane is at a higher angle from the horizon.

Using a circular ground plane of a half-wavelength radius with a skirt of a quarter wavelength wound around it, the angle of the peak directivity and the horizontal gain for the ground-based communication system were improved. For an ESPAR antenna - one of the monopole arrays - the horizontal gain was also improved. It was confirmed that it was possible to form the main-beam radiation and a beam null in the horizontal plane, each in an arbitrary direction, by changing the control voltage to the passive element.

The MCM also has unique upper surface cooling feature. The MCMs successfully improve the conversion efficiency by using the MOSFETs with reduced body diode reverse recovery.

The research is focused on the development and implementation of turbo coding-decoding algorithms in high-speed programmable platforms (DSP and FPGA) for a better performance in terms of error correction, power consumption and speed. The MAP (maximum a-posteriori probability) algorithm represents the best performance choice for turbo decoding block. The main objective of implementation is to design structures for turbo decoding near to the theoretical performance using sub-optimal architectures. In this work we present a hardware implementation of the log-domain version of the AMP algorithm (log-AMP).

Input data is compressed using a dictionary-based lossless data compressor before encryption, then two elliptic curve cryptographic algorithms can be applied to the compressed data: ECIES for encryption or ECDSA for digital signature. Applying data compression presents three advantages: first, the improvement in the cryptographic module throughput by reducing the amount of data to be encrypted; second, the higher utilization of the available bandwidth if encrypted data is transmitted across a public network and third, the increment of the difficulty of recovering the original information. The architecture was described in VHDL and synthesized for a Xilinx FPGA device. The results achieved show that it is possible to combine these two algorithms in a single chip while gathering the advantages of compression and cryptography. This work is novel in the sense that no such algorithm combination has been reported, nor a hardware implementation of elliptic curve cryptographic schemes.","doi":"10.1109/CONIEL.2005.8","publicationTitle":"15th International Conference on Electronics, Communications and Computers (CONIELECOMP'05)","displayPublicationTitle":"15th International Conference on Electronics, Communications and Computers (CONIELECOMP'05)","pdfPath":"/iel5/9963/32018/01488545.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CONIEL.2005.8","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=32018","startPage":"113","endPage":"118","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A hardware architecture for elliptic curve cryptography and lossless data compression","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1488545","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A hardware architecture for elliptic curve cryptography and lossless data compression","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-02 Feb. 2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1488545/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"28 Feb.-2 March 2005","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"2005","accessionNumber":"8360580","dateOfInsertion":"01 August 2005","htmlLink":"/document/1488545/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A hardware architecture for elliptic curve cryptography and lossless data compression","confLoc":"Puebla, Mexico","sourcePdf":"01488545.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.142455S","chronDate":"28-02 Feb. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"9963","isNumber":"32018","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9963","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"32018","articleId":"1488545","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1488546,"authors":[{"name":"L.F.G.

The search algorithm finds the best sequence of codewords in the trellis representing the source sequence. The optimum trellis search is the Viterbi algorithm (VA). However for source coding applications, it becomes prohibitively complex. Hence, suboptimum search algorithms must be considered. The M algorithm is a suboptimum search whose performance is close to the optimum system. This algorithm retains the best M paths at every instant. Conventional architectures of this algorithm are impractical when the number of retained paths is large. In this paper new hardware architectures based on VA implementations are presented. Dividing the M algorithm into path metric updating and trace-back based survivor memory management procedures, efficient architectures can be achieved contributing to a significant reduction in the hardware complexity, which allows quantization systems with larger reproduction codebooks.","publicationTitle":"15th International Conference on Electronics, Communications and Computers (CONIELECOMP'05)","displayPublicationTitle":"15th International Conference on Electronics, Communications and Computers (CONIELECOMP'05)","pdfPath":"/iel5/9963/32018/01488546.pdf","startPage":"119","endPage":"124","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"VLSI architecture for the M algorithm suited for detection and source coding applications","doi":"10.1109/CONIEL.2005.69","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=32018","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CONIEL.2005.69","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1488546","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1488546/","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-02 Feb. 2005","displayDocTitle":"VLSI architecture for the M algorithm suited for detection and source coding applications","dateOfInsertion":"01 August 2005","publicationDate":"2005","accessionNumber":"8360581","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"28 Feb.-2 March 2005","htmlLink":"/document/1488546/","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"VLSI architecture for the M algorithm suited for detection and source coding applications","confLoc":"Puebla, Mexico","sourcePdf":"01488546.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056783S","chronDate":"28-02 Feb. 2005","xplore-pub-id":"9963","isNumber":"32018","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9963","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"32018","articleId":"1488546","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":1488561,"authors":[{"name":"J.L.M.

A camera-computer system called SIVEDI was developed based in the shape from focusing technique (SFF) as proposed by Jenn (1997) and a shape from defocusing technique (SFD) developed in this research. The SIVEDI system has as entries the images captured by the camera, the number of steps of the focus mechanism, and the user specifications. The focus mechanism used is the internal one of the camera. To control it an interface computer-camera was designed and developed. An equation is introduced to obtain the measure of relative defocus among many images. A 3D image is produced as the result of the system. SIVEDI consist of a number of modules, each one implementing a step in the system model. The modules are independent of each other and could be easily modified to improve the system. As SIVEDI was developed in the MatLab environment, it can be used in any computer with this software on it.

However, conventional real-time scheduling algorithms ignore the applications' security requirements. In recognition that an increasing number of applications running on clusters demand both real-time performance and security, we investigate the problem of scheduling a set of independent real-time tasks with various security requirements. We propose a security overhead model that is capable of measuring security overheads incurred by security-critical tasks. Further, we propose a security-aware scheduling strategy, or SAREC, which integrates security requirements into scheduling for real-time applications by employing our security overhead model. To evaluate the effectiveness of SAREC, we implement a security-aware real-time scheduling algorithm (SAREC-EDF), which incorporates the earliest deadline first (EDF) scheduling algorithm into SAREC Extensive simulation experiments show that SAREC-EDF significantly improves overall system performance over three baseline scheduling algorithms (variations of EDF) by up to 72.55%.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICPP.2005.68","doi":"10.1109/ICPP.2005.68","displayPublicationTitle":"2005 International Conference on Parallel Processing (ICPP'05)","pdfPath":"/iel5/9964/32019/01488595.pdf","startPage":"5","endPage":"12","publicationTitle":"2005 International Conference on Parallel Processing (ICPP'05)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=32019","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"SAREC: a security-aware scheduling strategy for real-time applications on clusters","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"SAREC: a security-aware scheduling strategy for real-time applications on clusters","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1488595/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-17 June 2005","conferenceDate":"14-17 June 2005","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2005","accessionNumber":"8598849","dateOfInsertion":"01 August 2005","htmlLink":"/document/1488595/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"SAREC: a security-aware scheduling strategy for real-time applications on clusters","confLoc":"Oslo, Norway","sourcePdf":"01488595.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060773S","chronDate":"14-17 June 2005","xplore-pub-id":"9964","isNumber":"32019","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9964","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"32019","articleId":"1488595","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1488596,"authors":[{"name":"Jian-Jia Chen","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, Graduate Institute of Networking and Multimedia, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Jian-Jia Chen","id":"37280675200"},{"name":"Tei-Wei Kuo","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, Graduate Institute of Networking and Multimedia, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Tei-Wei Kuo","id":"37276775300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7695-2380-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0190-3918"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2332-5690"}],"articleNumber":"1488596","dbTime":"18 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":22,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":336},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Energy efficiency","Energy consumption","Processor scheduling","Scheduling algorithm","Approximation algorithms","Voltage","Timing","Hardware","Computer science","Power engineering and energy"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["processor scheduling","real-time systems","energy conservation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiprocessor energy-efficient scheduling","uniprocessor environment","multiprocessor environment","real-time scheduling","deadline constraint"]}],"abstract":"In the past decades, a number of research results have been reported for energy-efficient scheduling over uniprocessor and multiprocessor environments. Different from many of the past results on the assumption for task power characteristics, we consider real-time scheduling of tasks with different power characteristics. The objective is to minimize the energy consumption of task executions under the given deadline constraint. When tasks have a common deadline and are ready at time 0, we propose an optimal real-time task scheduling algorithm for multiprocessor environments with the allowance of task migration. When no task migration is allowed, a 1.412-approximation algorithm for task scheduling is proposed for different settings of power characteristics. The performance of the approximation algorithm was evaluated by an extensive set of experiments, where excellent results were reported.","doi":"10.1109/ICPP.2005.53","publicationTitle":"2005 International Conference on Parallel Processing (ICPP'05)","displayPublicationTitle":"2005 International Conference on Parallel Processing (ICPP'05)","pdfPath":"/iel5/9964/32019/01488596.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICPP.2005.53","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=32019","startPage":"13","endPage":"20","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multiprocessor energy-efficient scheduling for real-time tasks with different power characteristics","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1488596","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Multiprocessor energy-efficient scheduling for real-time tasks with different power characteristics","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-17 June 2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1488596/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"14-17 June 2005","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"2005","accessionNumber":"8598850","dateOfInsertion":"01 August 2005","htmlLink":"/document/1488596/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multiprocessor energy-efficient scheduling for real-time tasks with different power characteristics","confLoc":"Oslo, Norway","sourcePdf":"01488596.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.082691S","chronDate":"14-17 June 2005","xplore-pub-id":"9964","isNumber":"32019","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9964","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"32019","articleId":"1488596","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":1488603,"authors":[{"name":"L.

The scalability problem of 802.11 timing synchronization has been recognized and studied by researchers in the field, but the proposed solutions are not meeting industry expectation. The compatibility issue is not well investigated by the research community yet. The compatibility issue is very important and practical because of the large deployment base of 802.11 networks. In this paper, we try to address both issues. We propose a simple, compatible protocol without any change of beacon format. The frequency adjustment is proved to be bounded and the maximum clock offset is controlled under 20 /spl mu/s. It is a significant improvement over the current results in the field. The current solutions with similar complexity can only control the maximum clock offset around 125 /spl mu/s for compatible solutions and 50 /spl mu/s for non-compatible protocols.","doi":"10.1109/ICPP.2005.6","displayPublicationTitle":"2005 International Conference on Parallel Processing (ICPP'05)","startPage":"295","endPage":"302","publicationTitle":"2005 International Conference on Parallel Processing (ICPP'05)","pdfPath":"/iel5/9964/32019/01488626.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICPP.2005.6","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=32019","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A compatible and scalable clock synchronization protocol in IEEE 802.11 ad hoc networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Clocks","Protocols","Intelligent networks","Ad hoc networks","Scalability","Frequency synchronization","Application specific processors","Timing","Computer science","Peer to peer computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ad hoc networks","wireless LAN","telecommunication network reliability","IEEE standards","synchronisation","timing","protocols","telecommunication standards"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["scalability","compatible clock synchronization protocol","IEEE 802.11 ad hoc network","maximum clock offset","timing synchronization function"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["IEEE 802.11","ad hoc networks","scalability","compatibility","clock synchronization"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A compatible and scalable clock synchronization protocol in IEEE 802.11 ad hoc networks","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"01 August 2005","accessionNumber":"8598870","publicationDate":"2005","htmlLink":"/document/1488626/","conferenceDate":"14-17 June 2005","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-17 June 2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1488626/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A compatible and scalable clock synchronization protocol in IEEE 802.11 ad hoc networks","confLoc":"Oslo, Norway","sourcePdf":"01488626.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.07663S","chronDate":"14-17 June 2005","xplore-pub-id":"9964","isNumber":"32019","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9964","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"32019","articleId":"1488626","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1488645,"authors":[{"name":"K.A.

This paper presents the design and implementation of the performance data management framework (PerfDMF). PerfDMF addresses objectives of performance tool integration, interoperation, and reuse by providing common data storage, access, and analysis infrastructure for parallel performance profiles. PerfDMF includes an extensible parallel profile data schema and relational database schema, a profile query and analysis programming interface, and an extendible toolkit for profile import/export and standard analysis. We describe the PerfDMF objectives and architecture, give detailed explanation of the major components, and show examples of PerfDMF application.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Performance analysis","Technology management","Information analysis","Project management","Data analysis","Information management","Memory","Measurement","Parallel processing","Computer architecture"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["parallel databases","relational databases","query processing","application program interfaces","parallel programming","performance evaluation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["parallel performance data management framework","parallel system","data storage","data access","data merging","parallel profile data schema","relational database schema","profile query","analysis programming interface"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=32019","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICPP.2005.29","startPage":"473","endPage":"482","publicationTitle":"2005 International Conference on Parallel Processing (ICPP'05)","displayPublicationTitle":"2005 International Conference on Parallel Processing (ICPP'05)","pdfPath":"/iel5/9964/32019/01488645.pdf","doi":"10.1109/ICPP.2005.29","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design and implementation of a parallel performance data management framework","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Design and implementation of a parallel performance data management framework","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"8598889","publicationDate":"2005","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"14-17 June 2005","dateOfInsertion":"01 August 2005","htmlLink":"/document/1488645/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1488645/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-17 June 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design and implementation of a parallel performance data management framework","confLoc":"Oslo, Norway","sourcePdf":"01488645.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047829S","chronDate":"14-17 June 2005","xplore-pub-id":"9964","isNumber":"32019","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9964","citationCount":"29","xplore-issue":"32019","articleId":"1488645","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":1488653,"authors":[{"name":"D.A.

The hierarchical memory systems of symmetric multiprocessor (SMP) clusters optimize for local, contiguous memory accesses, and so are inefficient platforms for such algorithms. Few parallel graph algorithms outperform their best sequential implementation on SMP clusters due to long memory latencies and high synchronization costs. In this paper, we consider the performance and scalability of two graph algorithms, list ranking and connected components, on two classes of shared-memory computers: symmetric multiprocessors such as the Sun Enterprise servers and multithreaded architectures (MTA) such as the Cray MTA-2. While previous studies have shown that parallel graph algorithms can speedup on SMPs, the systems' reliance on cache microprocessors limits performance. The MTA's latency tolerant processors and hardware support for fine-grain synchronization makes performance a function of parallelism. Since parallel graph algorithms have an abundance of parallelism, they perform and scale significantly better on the MTA. We describe and give a performance model for each architecture. We analyze the performance of the two algorithms and discuss how the features of each architecture affects algorithm development, ease of programming, performance, and scalability.","doi":"10.1109/ICPP.2005.55","publicationTitle":"2005 International Conference on Parallel Processing (ICPP'05)","displayPublicationTitle":"2005 International Conference on Parallel Processing (ICPP'05)","pdfPath":"/iel5/9964/32019/01488653.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICPP.2005.55","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=32019","startPage":"547","endPage":"556","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the architectural requirements for efficient execution of graph algorithms","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1488653","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"On the architectural requirements for efficient execution of graph algorithms","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-17 June 2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1488653/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"14-17 June 2005","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"2005","accessionNumber":"8598897","dateOfInsertion":"01 August 2005","htmlLink":"/document/1488653/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the architectural requirements for efficient execution of graph algorithms","confLoc":"Oslo, Norway","sourcePdf":"01488653.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072799S","chronDate":"14-17 June 2005","xplore-pub-id":"9964","isNumber":"32019","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9964","citationCount":"44","xplore-issue":"32019","articleId":"1488653","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":1488654,"authors":[{"name":"X.-H.

Given a DAG application to be scheduled on such a system, the search space of possible task schedules is immense. One possible approach for this type of NP-complete problem, which has been proposed by previous researchers, starts with the best task schedule found by a fast deterministic task scheduling algorithm, and then iteratively improves the task schedule using a random search method such as genetic algorithm search. However, such an approach can lead to extremely long search times, and the solutions found are sometimes not significantly better than those found by the original deterministic task scheduling algorithm. In this paper, we propose an alternative strategy, termed push-pull, which starts with the best task schedule found by a fast deterministic task scheduling algorithm, and then iteratively attempts to improve the current best solution using a deterministic guided search method. Our simulation results show that this new method performs quite well, executing faster and finding better solutions than a genetic algorithm-based method, which in turn has been shown to perform better than previous algorithms.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICPP.2005.66","doi":"10.1109/ICPP.2005.66","displayPublicationTitle":"2005 International Conference on Parallel Processing (ICPP'05)","pdfPath":"/iel5/9964/32019/01488659.pdf","startPage":"603","endPage":"610","publicationTitle":"2005 International Conference on Parallel Processing (ICPP'05)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=32019","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Push-pull: guided search DAG scheduling for heterogeneous clusters","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Push-pull: guided search DAG scheduling for heterogeneous clusters","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1488659/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-17 June 2005","conferenceDate":"14-17 June 2005","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2005","accessionNumber":"8598903","dateOfInsertion":"01 August 2005","htmlLink":"/document/1488659/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Push-pull: guided search DAG scheduling for heterogeneous clusters","confLoc":"Oslo, Norway","sourcePdf":"01488659.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056323S","chronDate":"14-17 June 2005","xplore-pub-id":"9964","isNumber":"32019","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9964","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"32019","articleId":"1488659","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":1488662,"authors":[{"name":"D.

Experimental results on random DAGs show that the makespans generated by the proposed algorithm are slightly better than those generated by the well known CPFD algorithm whereas the number of processors used is less than half of what is needed by CPFD solutions.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=32019","publicationTitle":"2005 International Conference on Parallel Processing (ICPP'05)","displayPublicationTitle":"2005 International Conference on Parallel Processing (ICPP'05)","pdfPath":"/iel5/9964/32019/01488662.pdf","doi":"10.1109/ICPP.2005.15","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICPP.2005.15","startPage":"630","endPage":"637","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A task duplication based scheduling algorithm using partial schedules","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"14-17 June 2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1488662/","displayDocTitle":"A task duplication based scheduling algorithm using partial schedules","htmlLink":"/document/1488662/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"14-17 June 2005","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"8598906","dateOfInsertion":"01 August 2005","publicationDate":"2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A task duplication based scheduling algorithm using partial schedules","confLoc":"Oslo, Norway","sourcePdf":"01488662.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.107523S","chronDate":"14-17 June 2005","xplore-pub-id":"9964","isNumber":"32019","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9964","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"32019","articleId":"1488662","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":1488698,"authors":[{"name":"A.

Among PMMS, the SIMPil (SIMD processor pixel) architecture satisfies the above requirements, especially with video and digital images processing tasks. In this paper we, exploit the SIMPil computation and throughput efficiency to implement the whole image processing chain of a digital still camera device. The implemented chain covers the whole image pipeline: from the Bayer pattern image processing to the JPEG image compression.

Computations such as wind-tunnel simulations, gene and protein analysis, drug discovery, and CGA rendering are run on commodity computers with very successful results. At the same time most cluster environments employ a highly heterogeneous set of machines due to the natural cycle of upgrades and purchases followed by most organizations. In such environments it is likely that some applications may be better suited for one type of machine over another and that the placement of jobs on machines can have a large impact on throughput and job completion time. This paper argues that using profile information to guide scheduling decisions can yield substantial performance improvements over a simple FCFS scheduling policy. In particular we look at a real-world job mix of genomic analysis applications and examine a number of scheduling algorithms that take profile information into account. Our results indicate that the benefits of profile-driven scheduling vary significantly based on the degree of heterogeneity available in the cluster and the variance in execution times of different job types across cluster machines. Additionally, we have discovered that affinity effects can also play an important role in improving performance, but plain affinity scheduling is not sufficient in achieving those benefits.","doi":"10.1109/ICPPW.2005.73","publicationTitle":"2005 International Conference on Parallel Processing Workshops (ICPPW'05)","displayPublicationTitle":"2005 International Conference on Parallel Processing Workshops (ICPPW'05)","pdfPath":"/iel5/9965/32020/01488713.pdf","startPage":"336","endPage":"345","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICPPW.2005.73","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=32020","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Profile driven scheduling for a heterogeneous server cluster","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1488713/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-17 June 2005","displayDocTitle":"Profile driven scheduling for a heterogeneous server cluster","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"2005","accessionNumber":"8580927","htmlLink":"/document/1488713/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"01 August 2005","conferenceDate":"14-17 June 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Profile driven scheduling for a heterogeneous server cluster","confLoc":"Oslo, Norway","sourcePdf":"01488713.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.077173S","chronDate":"14-17 June 2005","xplore-pub-id":"9965","isNumber":"32020","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9965","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"32020","articleId":"1488713","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":1488721,"authors":[{"name":"Xiao-Hui Lin","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China"],"lastName":"Xiao-Hui Lin","id":"37289263100"},{"name":"Yu-Kwong Kwok","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China"],"lastName":"Yu-Kwong Kwok","id":"37268292400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7695-2381-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0190-3918"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2332-5690"}],"articleNumber":"1488721","dbTime":"23 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":144},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Energy management","Intelligent networks","Wireless sensor networks","Batteries","Computer networks","Intelligent sensors","Military computing","Sensor systems and applications","Protocols","Energy dissipation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wireless sensor networks","access protocols","telecommunication power supplies","time-varying channels","telecommunication links","battery management systems","telecommunication network management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wireless sensor networks","energy constraints","network lifetime","network connectivity","wireless environment","energy saving protocol","channel quality","battery resource","sensor energy depletion","network partitioning","channel adaptive energy management protocol","CAEM","wireless link","cross-layer interaction","MAC layers","sensor node","energy utilization","energy dissipation","channel adaptation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["mobile computing","wireless sensor networks","power saving","channel state dependent","adaptive cross-layer protocols"]}],"abstract":"Energy constraints in a wireless sensor network are crucial issues critically affecting the network lifetime and connectivity. To realize true energy saving in a wireless environment, the time varying property of the wireless channel should also be taken into account. Unfortunately, this factor has long been ignored in most existing state-of-the-art energy saving protocols. Neglecting the effects of varying channel quality can lead to an unnecessary waste of precious battery resources, and, in turn, can result in the rapid depletion of sensor energy and partitioning of the network. In this paper, we propose a channel adaptive energy management protocol, called CAEM, that can exploit this time varying nature of the wireless link. Specifically, CAEM leverages on the synergistically cross-layer interaction between physical and MAC layers. Thus, each sensor node can intelligently access the wireless medium according to the current wireless link quality and the predicted traffic load, to realize an efficient utilization of the energy. Extensive simulation results indicate that CAEM can achieve as much as 40% reduction in energy dissipation compared with traditional protocols without channel adaptation.","doi":"10.1109/ICPPW.2005.61","displayPublicationTitle":"2005 International Conference on Parallel Processing Workshops (ICPPW'05)","pdfPath":"/iel5/9965/32020/01488721.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=32020","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICPPW.2005.61","publicationTitle":"2005 International Conference on Parallel Processing Workshops (ICPPW'05)","startPage":"397","endPage":"404","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On channel adaptive energy management in wireless sensor networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1488721","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-17 June 2005","displayDocTitle":"On channel adaptive energy management in wireless sensor networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1488721/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1488721/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2005","accessionNumber":"8588474","dateOfInsertion":"01 August 2005","conferenceDate":"14-17 June 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On channel adaptive energy management in wireless sensor networks","confLoc":"Oslo, Norway","sourcePdf":"01488721.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.077987S","chronDate":"14-17 June 2005","xplore-pub-id":"9965","isNumber":"32020","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9965","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"32020","articleId":"1488721","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":1488745,"authors":[{"name":"M.A. Vega-Rodriguez","affiliation":["Escuela Polit\u00e9cnica, Department Inform\u00e1tica, University of Extremadura, Caceres, Spain"],"firstName":"M.A.","lastName":"Vega-Rodriguez","id":"38270416500"},{"name":"R.

Each of the agents has its own strength on capturing a kind of network behavior and hence the system has strength on detecting different types of attack. In addition, its ability on detecting new types of attack as well as a higher tolerant to fluctuations were shown.

Experiments with function approximation and stock market movement analysis have been conducted to justify the new adaptive neural network model. Experimental results have revealed that the new adaptive neural network model presents several advantages over traditional neuron-fixed feed-forward networks such as much reduced network size, faster learning, and more promising financial analysis.","doi":"10.1109/ICITA.2005.109","pdfPath":"/iel5/9966/32021/01488822.pdf","startPage":"336","endPage":"340 vol.1","displayPublicationTitle":"Third International Conference on Information Technology and Applications (ICITA'05)","publicationTitle":"Third International Conference on Information Technology and Applications (ICITA'05)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICITA.2005.109","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=32021","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Data mining - an adaptive neural network model for financial analysis","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1488822/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-7 July 2005","displayDocTitle":"Data mining - an adaptive neural network model for financial analysis","isConference":true,"volume":"1","dateOfInsertion":"01 August 2005","accessionNumber":"8642284","publicationDate":"2005","htmlLink":"/document/1488822/","conferenceDate":"4-7 July 2005","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Data mining - an adaptive neural network model for financial analysis","confLoc":"Sydney, NSW, Australia","sourcePdf":"01488822.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.090214S","chronDate":"4-7 July 2005","xplore-pub-id":"9966","isNumber":"32021","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9966","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"32021","articleId":"1488822","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":1488827,"authors":[{"name":"Hsuan-Ming Feng","affiliation":["Department of Management Information, National Kinmen Institute of Technology, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Hsuan-Ming Feng","id":"37087314158"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7695-2316-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"1488827","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":12,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":119},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Particle swarm optimization","Fuzzy systems","Fuzzy sets","Computer simulation","Birds","Partitioning algorithms","Information management","Technology management","Evolutionary computation","Marine animals"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optimisation","learning systems","learning (artificial intelligence)","fuzzy systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["particle swarm optimization","learning fuzzy systems design","PSO learning algorithm","fuzzy system generation","car-pole system balancing","nonlinear function approximation","PSO feature","fast convergence","small computational load","computer simulation","adjustable fuzzy system parameter","nonlinear problem"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1488827","abstract":"A particle swarm optimization (PSO) learning algorithm is proposed in our research to generate fuzzy systems for balancing the car-pole system and approximating a nonlinear function.

The NAND type flash memory, briefly denoted by NandFlash, is one of the more often-used storage devices. In terms of unit price, its cost is several dozen to hundred times more expensive than the traditional hard-disk (HD) since its storage space is limited. Therefore, to increase the storage space of NandFlash is great significance. In this paper, we improved the compression layer for NandFlash, which can be coordinated with the X-RL algorithm, to avoid overhead and reduce the degree of internal fragmentation in the compressed data pages. Hence, our proposed method can improve the compression rate. In the reading phase, we use the consecutive memory allocation method, which can reduce the superfluous time caused by non-consecutive access. Therefore, our architecture is meaningful and practical for embedded system applications.","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1488873/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-7 July 2005","publicationDate":"2005","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"4-7 July 2005","htmlLink":"/document/1488873/","dateOfInsertion":"01 August 2005","accessionNumber":"8642335","isConference":true,"volume":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A compression layer for NAND type flash memory systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A compression layer for NAND type flash memory systems","confLoc":"Sydney, NSW, Australia","sourcePdf":"01488873.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05801S","chronDate":"4-7 July 2005","xplore-pub-id":"9966","isNumber":"32021","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9966","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"32021","articleId":"1488873","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":1488922,"authors":[{"name":"Gengqian Liu","affiliation":["Hebei University of Technology, Tianjin, China"],"lastName":"Gengqian Liu","id":"37836600600"},{"name":"Tiejun Li","affiliation":["Hebei University of Technology, Tianjin, China"],"lastName":"Tiejun Li","id":"37293055800"},{"name":"Yuqing Peng","affiliation":["Hebei University of Technology, Tianjin, China"],"lastName":"Yuqing Peng","id":"37675658100"},{"name":"Xiangdan Hou","affiliation":["Hebei University of Technology, Tianjin, China"],"lastName":"Xiangdan Hou","id":"37311457600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7695-2316-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"1488922","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":14,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":458},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Path planning","Cities and towns","Orbital robotics","Ant colony optimization","Mathematical model","Intelligent robots","Robustness","Constraint optimization","Optimization methods","Traveling salesman problems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["intelligent robots","path planning","search problems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ant algorithm","robot path planning problem","search problem","VB language"]}],"abstract":"Using ant algorithm, robot path planning in two-dimension environment is studied.

The AFGLVQ adjusts the kernels of the TSWNN while the VRLS updates the connection weights of the network. The identification algorithm has the properties of rapid convergence and persistent adaptability that make it suitable for real-time control. Secondly, on the basis of the one-step ahead TSWNN predictor, the control law is optimized iteratively through a numerical stable Davidon\u2019s least squares-based (SDLS) minimization approach.

In this paper, we propose a binary CA-MC-CDMA (constant amplitude multicode code division multiple access) system to solve the high PAPR problem. Unlike the conventional pre-coding method, there is no loss of bandwidth efficiency in the proposed system because the code rate is always 1. The proposed system always generates output signal with 0 dB PAPR. The proposed binary CA-MC-CDMA system is based on the 2/2 and 4/4 binary CA-MC-CDMA systems. The proposed system can be easily extended into a large number of parallel multi-code branches by multiple combinations of these two systems. From the computer simulation results, it can be seen that the proposed binary CA-MC-CDMA system always produces binary constant amplitude output data without any loss of code rate, which cannot be found in the conventional MC-CDMA using a pre-coding method. Therefore, it can prevent the nonlinear distortion in the HPA and maximization of HPA power efficiency can be available in the data transmission using multi-code","displayPublicationTitle":"Third International Conference on Information Technology and Applications (ICITA'05)","pdfPath":"/iel5/9966/32022/01488966.pdf","startPage":"259","endPage":"264","publicationTitle":"Third International Conference on Information Technology and Applications (ICITA'05)","doi":"10.1109/ICITA.2005.316","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICITA.2005.316","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=32022","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1488966","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design of Binary Multi-code CDMA System with Constant Amplitude","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multiaccess communication","Peak to average power ratio","Multicarrier code division multiple access","Nonlinear distortion","Bandwidth","Power engineering and energy","Data communication","Partial transmit sequences","Educational institutions","Signal generators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiple access","nonlinear distortion","Walsh functions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiple access communication","binary multicode CDMA system","peak to average power ratio","PAPR","Walsh codes","pre-coding method","nonlinear distortion","high power amplifier","maximization","data transmission"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1488966/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-7 July 2005","displayDocTitle":"Design of Binary Multi-code CDMA System with Constant Amplitude","isConference":true,"volume":"2","htmlLink":"/document/1488966/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2005","accessionNumber":"9044678","dateOfInsertion":"01 August 2005","conferenceDate":"4-7 July 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design of Binary Multi-code CDMA System with Constant Amplitude","confLoc":"Sydney, NSW, Australia","sourcePdf":"01488966.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055302S","chronDate":"4-7 July 2005","xplore-pub-id":"9966","isNumber":"32022","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9966","xplore-issue":"32022","articleId":"1488966","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":1488973,"authors":[{"name":"K.H.

This needs security processor for user's authentication and encrypted information based on PKI(public key infrastructure). The DICOM (digital imaging communications in medicine), which is a standard of PACS's transmission, has adopted RSA(Rivest Shamir Adleman) in the authentication and transmission, which is public key algorithm. However, in embedded medical image system using low power and restricted hardware resource, it's long key size is an important problem on the hardware implementation and processing time. Moreover, the public key algorithm, ECC(elliptic curve cryptography) supported higher security than those of RSA in the same key size. In this paper, the DICOM security standard RSA is substituted for ECC and we implemented it. ECC is implemented on GF(2/sup 163/) using polynomial base.

These characteristics provide an increase in system capacity and security performance. The paper presents a study of two different commonly used chaotic logistic maps and a modified chaotic logistic map for CSK spread spectrum system. The newly modified logistic map provides similar bits error rate (BER) performance to the best logistic map.

According to the typical daily load patterns and the energy consumption by customers, the hourly loading of distribution transformers can therefore be obtained. A three-phase load flow program is applied to solve feeder loss for different scenarios of input neurons to create the training data set for the neural network. The Levenburg-Marquardt (LM) algorithm is used for ANN to derive the neural based simplified loss model of distribution feeders. Two distribution feeders of Taipower system are selected for computer simulation to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method for distribution system loss analysis. It is found that the daily loss pattern of distribution feeders can be solved in a very efficient manner with ANN loss model by considering the key factors of feeder loading, feeder length and transformer capacity.","doi":"10.1109/PES.2005.1489069","pdfPath":"/iel5/9893/32012/01489069.pdf","startPage":"164","endPage":"170 Vol. 1","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Power Engineering Society General Meeting, 2005","publicationTitle":"IEEE Power Engineering Society General Meeting, 2005","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PES.2005.1489069","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=32012","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Development of distribution feeder loss models by artificial neural networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1489069/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-16 June 2005","displayDocTitle":"Development of distribution feeder loss models by artificial neural networks","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"01 August 2005","accessionNumber":"8681105","publicationDate":"2005","htmlLink":"/document/1489069/","conferenceDate":"16-16 June 2005","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Development of distribution feeder loss models by artificial neural networks","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"01489069.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068028S","chronDate":"12-16 June 2005","xplore-pub-id":"9893","isNumber":"32012","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9893","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"32012","articleId":"1489069","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":1489078,"authors":[{"name":"Chi-Min Chu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Tsing Hua University, Taiwan"],"bio":{"p":["Chi-Min Chu was born in Chang-Hua, Taiwan, R.O.C., 1966.

Taipower attempted to make the optimal economic fuel-cost dispatch of its existing generation capacity by applying direct load control method (DLC). However, some constraints such as the outdoor temperature, thermal comfort level of consumers, and air-conditioning load payback phenomenon restrain the executions of DLC. In order to alleviate the above problems, a reasonable DLC program with a least enthalpy estimator (LEE)-based fuzzy thermal comfort controller of air-conditioning systems is proposed in this paper. It can store the heat transfer capacity of the chilled water by a time delay after load-shedding command is issued. With the help of the proposed LEE-based fuzzy control and this pre-stored chilled-water heat transfer capacity, a smaller increase of the chilled-water temperature during off-shift period is obtained which can avoid the transient payback load effect. Meanwhile, the thermal comfort is also maintained within an acceptable level.","doi":"10.1109/PES.2005.1489078","startPage":"664","endPage":"669 Vol. 1","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Power Engineering Society General Meeting, 2005","pdfPath":"/iel5/9893/32012/01489078.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Power Engineering Society General Meeting, 2005","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PES.2005.1489078","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=32012","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A direct load control of air-conditioning loads with thermal comfort control","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Load flow control","Thermal loading","Fuzzy control","Heat transfer","Costs","Fuel economy","Temperature","Fuzzy systems","Control systems","Water heating"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["load regulation","air conditioning","fuzzy control","heat transfer","delays","load shedding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["direct load control","air-conditioning","thermal comfort control","Taipower","optimal economic fuel-cost dispatch","generation capacity","least enthalpy estimator","transfer capacity","chilled water","time delay","load-shedding command","fuzzy control","transient payback load effect"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1489078/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-16 June 2005","displayDocTitle":"A direct load control of air-conditioning loads with thermal comfort control","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1489078/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2005","dateOfInsertion":"01 August 2005","conferenceDate":"16-16 June 2005","accessionNumber":"8661709","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A direct load control of air-conditioning loads with thermal comfort control","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"01489078.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.039956S","chronDate":"12-16 June 2005","xplore-pub-id":"9893","isNumber":"32012","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9893","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"32012","articleId":"1489078","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":1489101,"authors":[{"name":"Ning Lu","affiliation":["Energy Science and Technology Division, Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, Richland, WA, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Ning Lu (M'98) received her B.S.E.E. from Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China, in 1993, and her M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in electric power engineering from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Troy, New York, in 1999 and 2002, respectively.

Based on the proposed affine model, a feedback linearization nonlinear controller is introduced and used to improve the POD.

A new adaptive strategy for choosing parameters is also proposed to assure convergence of IPSO method. The proposed IPSO algorithm is also extended to handle mixed variables, such as transformer taps and the reactive power source installation, using a simple scheme. The IPSO applied for optimal power system reactive power dispatch is evaluated on an IEEE 30-bus power system and a practical 118-bus power system in which the control of bus voltages, tap position of transformers and reactive power sources are involved to minimize the transmission loss of the power system.

Due to the adverse effects produced by the operation of arc furnace, it is important to build a practical model to described the behavior of electric arc furnace. The electrical fluctuations in the arc furnace voltage have proven to be chaotic in nature. Therefore, this paper deals with the problem of DC electric arc furnace modeling using the chaos theory and neural network. The radial basis function neural network is used to predict the arc voltage of arc furnace with one-step and multi-step ahead based on the embedding dimension in the reconstructed phase space.

We reduced the noise figure (NF) over the frequency range from 3.1 to 10.6 GHz (the FCC-specified UWB range) by using a novel LNA structure with an inductor-terminated, common-base input stage in front of a resistive-feedback amplifier. The circuit topology simultaneously enables increased gain for the input stage and wideband noise matching. On-chip measurement using microwave probes has shown that the LNA - fabricated using commercially available 0.25- /spl mu/m SOI SiGe BiCMOS technology - provides a wide 3-dB bandwidth of 14.5 GHz, an S21 of 22 dB, and a low noise figure ranging from 2.7 dB to 3.9 dB, along with low power consumption of 13.2 mW.

It was very difficult to detect the symmetrical fault reliably and fast during power swing with complex power swing conditions and fault conditions considered. This paper presents a new fast detector of symmetrical fault during power swing. Based on the sudden reduction of absolute value of the change rate of power swing centre voltage (PSCV), the presented detector can detect the symmetrical fault reliably and sensitively in two cycles. This detector is easy to set and immune to the swing period, fault arc, fault location and power angle. EMTP simulations and real-time digital simulator system (RTDS) tests prove the presented detector is fast, sensible and reliable.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"12-16 June 2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1489209/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"8704589","publicationDate":"2005","conferenceDate":"16-16 June 2005","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1489209/","dateOfInsertion":"01 August 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Fast detector of symmetrical fault during power swing for distance relay","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fast detector of symmetrical fault during power swing for distance relay","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"01489209.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057418S","chronDate":"12-16 June 2005","xplore-pub-id":"9893","isNumber":"32012","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9893","citationCount":"40","xplore-issue":"32012","articleId":"1489209","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1489255,"authors":[{"name":"R.V. de Oliveira","affiliation":["Escola de Engenharia de S\u00e3o Carlos-USP, Sao Carlos, Brazil"],"firstName":"R.V.","lastName":"de Oliveira","id":"37291068000"},{"name":"R.A.

The approach avoids the complicated eigensolution of the state matrix that results in heavy computational burden. The approach is composed of three steps. First, the inter-area oscillating modes of a power system is identified and the information necessary for designing the TCSC POD controller is obtained by the test signal method. Second, the input signal of the POD controller is selected through comparing the residue ratio of the different input signals. The third, the controller parameters are tuned to compensate the residue phase angle. The validity of the design is illustrated by comparing the changes of the damping ratio in frequency domain and by a transient simulation in time domain.

However, given the current technological and psychological barriers, decision makers need tools to assess whether the inherent advantages of wide-area control over local control can outweigh the risk incurred by the additional complexity of the underlying telecommunication and SCADA systems. This paper devises a simple small signal analysis-based methodology for pinpointing control sites where wide-area control has a substantial technical advantage over a purely local control. Using a novel fuzzy logic-based PSS scheme applicable to both static var compensators (SVC) and synchronous condensers (SC), the authors first demonstrate the claims of their paper on an interesting three-area power system proposed by Anderson and Farmer. Based on small- and large-signal studies, the findings are then generalized to a large study network from Quebec's provincial ISO, equipped with SVCs and SCs at six and four 735-kV substations respectively, all of them included in the scope of this study. Overall, wide-area control is consistently three to 20 times more efficient technically than the competing local control, depending on the network and the control site.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1489412/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-16 June 2005","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"16-16 June 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"2005","dateOfInsertion":"01 August 2005","htmlLink":"/document/1489412/","accessionNumber":"8690039","displayDocTitle":"Assessing the technical value of FACTS-based wide-area damping control loops","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Assessing the technical value of FACTS-based wide-area damping control loops","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"1489412.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.076022S","chronDate":"12-16 June 2005","xplore-pub-id":"9893","isNumber":"32012","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9893","citationCount":"43","xplore-issue":"32012","articleId":"1489412","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":1489424,"authors":[{"name":"G.A.

In this trend, the impact of time delays introduced by remote signal transmission and processing in WAMS has to be considered. This paper investigates the wide-area controller design problem of power system in the presence of output feedback delays in WAMS. Firstly, a simple example demonstrates the negative effects of feedback signals' time delays of WAMS on the dynamic performances of thyristor controlled series compensator (TCSC). In order to eliminate the negative effects of time delays, a novel approach based on linear matrix inequality (LMI) technique and Hankel model order-reduced algorithms is proposed to design an effective TCSC controller. Two cases, a single-machine-infinite-bus power system and New England test power system (NETPS), verify that the derived TCSC controllers can stabilize the systems for various time delays.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1489496/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-16 June 2005","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"16-16 June 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"2005","dateOfInsertion":"01 August 2005","htmlLink":"/document/1489496/","accessionNumber":"8704574","displayDocTitle":"Wide-area TCSC controller design in consideration of feedback signals' time delays","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Wide-area TCSC controller design in consideration of feedback signals' time delays","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"01489496.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.040354S","chronDate":"12-16 June 2005","xplore-pub-id":"9893","isNumber":"32012","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9893","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"32012","articleId":"1489496","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":1489500,"authors":[{"name":"S.B.

The last few decades have seen minimal investment in infrastructure, and little has been done to prepare the ageing equipment for increasing load growths and the demands of open access. Consequently, the deployment of distributed energy resources (DER) is becoming an increasingly attractive alternative to the expensive and time consuming processes of upgrading and augmenting the transmission and distribution systems. DERs are small, modular sources (generation or storage) of energy which are often more efficient and controllable than traditional power plants. These devices are installed at or near centers of utilization. Eventually, as their penetration increases considerably, they are interconnected in a grid-like fashion for stability and enhanced reliability. These grids are called 'microgrids'. This paper presents a rational method of building microgrids optimized for cost and subject to reliability constraints. The method is based on dynamic programming and consists of determining the optimal interconnection between microsources and load points, given their locations and the rights of way for possible interconnections. A new approach, called 'unit link addition', is also introduced. The method is demonstrated using a 22-bus system.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Power Engineering Society General Meeting, 2005","pdfPath":"/iel5/9893/32012/01489500.pdf","startPage":"2372","endPage":"2377 Vol. 3","publicationTitle":"IEEE Power Engineering Society General Meeting, 2005","doi":"10.1109/PES.2005.1489500","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PES.2005.1489500","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=32012","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1489500","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Microgrid architecture: a reliability constrained approach","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power generation","Power system reliability","Stress","Investments","Aging","Energy resources","Density estimation robust algorithm","Energy storage","Power system interconnection","Stability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power grids","power system reliability","power system interconnection","dynamic programming"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["microgrid architecture","reliability constrained approach","power delivery infrastructure","ageing equipment","distributed energy resources","transmission systems","distribution systems","grid-like interconnection","dynamic programming"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1489500/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-16 June 2005","displayDocTitle":"Microgrid architecture: a reliability constrained approach","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1489500/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2005","accessionNumber":"8883869","dateOfInsertion":"01 August 2005","conferenceDate":"16-16 June 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Microgrid architecture: a reliability constrained approach","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"01489500.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055298S","chronDate":"12-16 June 2005","xplore-pub-id":"9893","isNumber":"32012","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9893","citationCount":"29","xplore-issue":"32012","articleId":"1489500","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":1489526,"authors":[{"name":"A.

This methodology is considered suitable for prediction time series. Using the database of daily sunshine duration, air temperature and global solar radiation data corresponding to typical reference year (TRY). A RBF model has been trained based on 300 known data from TRY, in this way, the network was trained to accept and even handle a number of unusual cases. Known data were subsequently used to investigate the accuracy of prediction. Subsequently, the unknown validation data set produced very accurate estimation, with the mean relative error (MRE) not exceed 1.5% between the actual and predicted data, also the correlation coefficient obtained for the validation data set is 98.9%, these results indicates that the proposed model can successfully be used for prediction and modeling of daily global solar radiation data from sunshine duration and air temperature.

An approach to predict the market behaviors is to use the historical prices, loads and other required information to forecast the future prices and loads. This paper introduces an approach for several-hours-ahead electricity price and load forecasting using artificial intelligence method, such as neural network model, which uses publicly available data from NEMMCO web site to forecast electricity prices and loads for the Victorian electricity market. An approach of selection of similar days is proposed according to which the load and price curves are forecasted by using the information of the days being similar to that of the forecast day. A Euclidean norm with weighted factors is used for the selection of similar days. Two different ANN models, one for several-hours-ahead load forecasting and another for several-hours-ahead price forecasting have been proposed. The forecasted price and load from the neural network is obtained by adding a correction to the selected similar days, and the correction is obtained from the neural network. MAPE results show that several-hours-ahead electricity price and load in the deregulated Victorian market can be forecasted with reasonable accuracy.","doi":"10.1109/PES.2005.1489530","startPage":"2146","endPage":"2153 Vol. 3","publicationTitle":"IEEE Power Engineering Society General Meeting, 2005","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PES.2005.1489530","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=32012","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Power Engineering Society General Meeting, 2005","pdfPath":"/iel5/9893/32012/01489530.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Several-hours-ahead electricity price and load forecasting using neural networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1489530/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Several-hours-ahead electricity price and load forecasting using neural networks","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1489530/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"8883818","publicationDate":"2005","dateOfInsertion":"01 August 2005","conferenceDate":"16-16 June 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-16 June 2005","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Several-hours-ahead electricity price and load forecasting using neural networks","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"01489530.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.086053S","chronDate":"12-16 June 2005","xplore-pub-id":"9893","isNumber":"32012","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9893","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"32012","articleId":"1489530","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":1489534,"authors":[{"name":"I.

With the high utilization of wind power a simultaneous loss of several thousand MW wind generation became a realistic scenario in the German power system. Therefore, the main requirements concern the fault ride through capability of wind turbines. Accordingly, disconnection of wind turbines and wind farms above 15 % nominal voltage at the grid connection nodes is not allowed. Besides, following network faults wind turbines have to supply a definite reactive current depending on the instantaneous voltage. Furthermore, they must return quickly to normal operation. The frequency range wind turbines have to tolerate is about 47.5-51.5 Hz. According to the wishes of German transmission grid operators, large wind farms have to be treated in the future like conventional power plants.","doi":"10.1109/PES.2005.1489534","publicationTitle":"IEEE Power Engineering Society General Meeting, 2005","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Power Engineering Society General Meeting, 2005","pdfPath":"/iel5/9893/32012/01489534.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PES.2005.1489534","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=32012","startPage":"1253","endPage":"1257 Vol. 2","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Grid code requirements concerning connection and operation of wind turbines in Germany","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1489534","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Grid code requirements concerning connection and operation of wind turbines in Germany","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-16 June 2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1489534/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"16-16 June 2005","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"2005","accessionNumber":"8704520","dateOfInsertion":"01 August 2005","htmlLink":"/document/1489534/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Grid code requirements concerning connection and operation of wind turbines in Germany","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"01489534.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046317S","chronDate":"12-16 June 2005","xplore-pub-id":"9893","isNumber":"32012","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9893","citationCount":"135","xplore-issue":"32012","articleId":"1489534","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":1489536,"authors":[{"name":"Y.Y.

The series active filter is a dynamic voltage restorer (DVR), which is operated in twofold functioning mode. During the unbalanced voltage sag, the DVR compensates the unbalance in the voltage sag. It also regulates the voltage at the load end with minimum VA loading of the overall UPQC by voltage injection at optimum angle. Sliding mode controller with constant frequency is employed to ensure the exact tracking of the reference voltage by DVR. Validity of the proposed scheme is proved through extensive simulation results.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Power Engineering Society General Meeting, 2005","pdfPath":"/iel5/9893/32012/01489536.pdf","startPage":"871","endPage":"875 Vol. 1","publicationTitle":"IEEE Power Engineering Society General Meeting, 2005","doi":"10.1109/PES.2005.1489536","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PES.2005.1489536","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=32012","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1489536","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A sliding mode controller based optimum UPQC with minimum VA loading","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sliding mode control","Voltage fluctuations","Automatic voltage control","Pulse width modulation inverters","Reactive power","Active filters","Switching converters","Power quality","Voltage control","Power electronics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["variable structure systems","power supply quality","active filters","power filters","voltage control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["sliding mode controller","VA loading","unified power quality conditioner","active power filters","dynamic voltage restorer","voltage regulation","voltage injection"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1489536/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-16 June 2005","displayDocTitle":"A sliding mode controller based optimum UPQC with minimum VA loading","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1489536/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2005","accessionNumber":"8671249","dateOfInsertion":"01 August 2005","conferenceDate":"16-16 June 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A sliding mode controller based optimum UPQC with minimum VA loading","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"1489536.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065427S","chronDate":"12-16 June 2005","xplore-pub-id":"9893","isNumber":"32012","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9893","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"32012","articleId":"1489536","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":1489556,"authors":[{"name":"A.

DC power flow is a simplification of a full power flow looking only at active power flows. Aspects as voltage support and reactive power management are not considered. However, such simplifications cannot always be justified and might sometimes be unrealistic. In this paper authors analyze the assumptions of DC power flow, and make an attempt at quantifying these using indexes. Among other, the paper answers the question of how low the X/R ratio of line parameters can be, and what is the maximal deviation from the perfect flat voltage which still allows DC power flow to be acceptably accurate.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"12-16 June 2005","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1489581/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1489581/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2005","accessionNumber":"8681133","conferenceDate":"16-16 June 2005","dateOfInsertion":"01 August 2005","displayDocTitle":"Usefulness of DC power flow for active power flow analysis","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Usefulness of DC power flow for active power flow analysis","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"01489581.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071436S","chronDate":"12-16 June 2005","xplore-pub-id":"9893","isNumber":"32012","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9893","citationCount":"177","xplore-issue":"32012","articleId":"1489581","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-22"},{"_id":1489592,"authors":[{"name":"A.

We analyze the effect of high-speed varactor dithering on the phase noise and show that it can be made sufficiently small.

A 1.95 GHz WCDMA InGaP/GaAs HBT PA module (PAM) has been developed to validate the proposed circuit. The PAM demonstrates a very low quiescent current of 20 mA. It exhibits 40.5% PAE (power added efficiency) and -40 dBc ACLR1 at 28 dBm Pout. At a backoff output power of 18 dBm, the PAM achieves 19% PAE with -41 dBc ACLR1.

GA is a global search technique based on principles inspired from the genetic and evolution mechanism observed in natural biological systems. A major drawback of the conventional GA (CGA) approach is that it can be time consuming. The micro-GA (/spl mu/GA) approach has been proposed as a better time efficient alternative for some engineering problems. The effectiveness of CGA and /spl mu/GA. to solving ED problem is initially verified on an IEEE 3-generating unit, 6-bus test system. Simulation results obtained on this network using CGA and /spl mu/GA validate their effectiveness when compared with the published results obtained via the classical and the Hopfield neural network approaches. Finally, both GA approaches have been successfully applied to the coordination of the Nigerian 31-bus system fed by four thermal and three hydro generating units. Herein, use has been made of the loss formula developed for the Nigerian system from several power flow studies. For the Nigerian case study, the /spl mu/GA. is shown to exhibit superior performance than the CGA from both optimal generation allocations and computational time viewpoints.","doi":"10.1109/PES.2005.1489725","startPage":"551","endPage":"556 Vol. 1","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Power Engineering Society General Meeting, 2005","pdfPath":"/iel5/9893/32012/01489725.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Power Engineering Society General Meeting, 2005","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PES.2005.1489725","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=32012","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Genetic algorithms based economic dispatch with application to coordination of Nigerian thermal power plants","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Genetic algorithms","Power generation economics","Power generation","Power system economics","Fuel economy","Power system reliability","Quadratic programming","Costs","Electronic mail","Linear programming"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithms","thermal power stations","power generation dispatch","power generation economics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithms","economic dispatch","Nigerian thermal power plants","global search technique","evolution mechanism","IEEE 3-generating unit","6-bus test system","Hopfield neural network","hydro generating units","optimal generation allocations"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1489725/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-16 June 2005","displayDocTitle":"Genetic algorithms based economic dispatch with application to coordination of Nigerian thermal power plants","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1489725/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2005","dateOfInsertion":"01 August 2005","conferenceDate":"16-16 June 2005","accessionNumber":"8681143","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Genetic algorithms based economic dispatch with application to coordination of Nigerian thermal power plants","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"01489725.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046425S","chronDate":"12-16 June 2005","xplore-pub-id":"9893","isNumber":"32012","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9893","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"32012","articleId":"1489725","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":1489741,"authors":[{"name":"Byoung-Hee Kim","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/9893/32012/1489741/1489741-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Byoung-Hee, Kim received the B.S. and M.S degrees in Control and Instrumentation Engineering from University of Ulsan in 1998 and 2000, respectively.

A technique using large and small transistors in parallel at the output stage for efficiency and linearity enhancement is proposed. A small transistor is used for low power amplification where a larger transistor is turned off to reduce DC power consumption and increase efficiency in the back-off region. The method of improving the linearity of FET amplifiers by offsetting the gate bias to cancel the nonlinearity products is implemented in combination with the efficiency enhancement. For the first time, both techniques are incorporated in the design of a 1.9 GHz CMOS power amplifier that achieves a power-added efficiency (PAE) of 22% at 23-dBm output power. PAE at 6-dB power back-off is measured to be 15%, which exhibits a factor of 2 improvement from the normal class-AB design. Also, third-order intermodulation is improved by approximately 8 dB in the high-power mode of operation when the linearity improvement technique is applied. In addition, this technique does not use transmission line or additional circuits, thus making it ideal for integrated circuit RF power amplifier design.","doi":"10.1109/RFIC.2005.1489775","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RFIC.2005.1489775","startPage":"251","endPage":"254","displayPublicationTitle":"2005 IEEE Radio Frequency integrated Circuits (RFIC) Symposium - Digest of Papers","pdfPath":"/iel5/9955/32008/01489775.pdf","publicationTitle":"2005 IEEE Radio Frequency integrated Circuits (RFIC) Symposium - Digest of Papers","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=32008","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Linear RF CMOS power amplifier with improved efficiency and linearity in wide power levels","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 June 2005","displayDocTitle":"Linear RF CMOS power amplifier with improved efficiency and linearity in wide power levels","conferenceDate":"12-14 June 2005","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2005","dateOfInsertion":"08 August 2005","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/1489775/","accessionNumber":"8479138","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1489775/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Linear RF CMOS power amplifier with improved efficiency and linearity in wide power levels","confLoc":"Long Beach, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"01489775.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056714S","chronDate":"12-14 June 2005","xplore-pub-id":"9955","isNumber":"32008","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9955","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"32008","articleId":"1489775","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":1489776,"authors":[{"name":"I.A.

A pseudo-differential common-emitter input stage with both capacitive and input bondwire inductive peaking was used to achieve high bandwidth and low noise performance. Cascode configurations and Miller capacitance neutralization techniques were used to minimize the input capacitance of the high current stages. This eliminates or reduces to one the number of inter-stage isolation emitter followers, and therefore allows a low voltage operation. The limiting amplifier uses a modified Cherry-Hooper architecture having a cross-coupled pair that speeds-up the switching and thus reduces its noise sensitivity.","doi":"10.1109/RFIC.2005.1489795","publicationTitle":"2005 IEEE Radio Frequency integrated Circuits (RFIC) Symposium - Digest of Papers","displayPublicationTitle":"2005 IEEE Radio Frequency integrated Circuits (RFIC) Symposium - Digest of Papers","pdfPath":"/iel5/9955/32008/01489795.pdf","startPage":"313","endPage":"316","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=32008","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RFIC.2005.1489795","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Notice of Violation of IEEE Publication Principles: A 3.3V 10Gb/s SiGe limiting transimpedance amplifier using a pseudo-differential input and a limiting Cherry-Hooper stage","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1489795","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Notice of Violation of IEEE Publication Principles: A 3.3V 10Gb/s SiGe limiting transimpedance amplifier using a pseudo-differential input and a limiting Cherry-Hooper stage","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1489795/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"2005","htmlLink":"/document/1489795/","accessionNumber":"8479149","conferenceDate":"12-14 June 2005","dateOfInsertion":"08 August 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 June 2005","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Notice of Violation of IEEE Publication Principles: A 3.3V 10Gb/s SiGe limiting transimpedance amplifier using a pseudo-differential input and a limiting Cherry-Hooper stage","confLoc":"Long Beach, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"01489795.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.036583S","chronDate":"12-14 June 2005","xplore-pub-id":"9955","isNumber":"32008","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9955","xplore-issue":"32008","articleId":"1489795","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-17"},{"_id":1489802,"authors":[{"name":"Ming-Da Tsai","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Graduate Institute of Communication Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Ming-Da Tsai","id":"37087182800"},{"name":"Kun-You Lin","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Graduate Institute of Communication Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Kun-You Lin","id":"37087147867"},{"name":"Huei Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Graduate Institute of Communication Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Huei Wang","id":"37087149107"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-8983-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1529-2517"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2375-0995"}],"articleNumber":"1489802","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":16,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":263},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Silicon germanium","Germanium silicon alloys","BiCMOS integrated circuits","Receivers","Distributed amplifiers","Ultra wideband technology","Energy consumption","Noise measurement","Semiconductor device measurement","Noise figure"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MMIC amplifiers","distributed amplifiers","Ge-Si alloys","BiCMOS analogue integrated circuits","ultra wideband communication","radio receivers","power consumption","integrated circuit design"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["LNA designs","BiCMOS technology","UWB wireless receivers","distributed amplifier","gain","power consumption","roll-off","noise figures","MMIC","chip size","ultra-wideband communication systems","5.4 mW","0.35 micron","3.1 to 10.6 GHz","10 dB","1.5 V","SiGe"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1489802","abstract":"A modified low-power and low-noise distributed amplifier for ultra-wideband (UWB) radio systems is first proposed to overcome the bottleneck of conventional DA.

The operational mechanism of the proposed method is analyzed through circuit simulation with a complementary LC differential oscillator topology. This shows that the amount of 1/f noise and the mismatch of instantaneous current swing of the oscillator active devices can be substantially reduced with source damping resistors. The reduced 1/f noise and instant current mismatch leads to a phase noise improvement by suppressing 1/f noise up-conversion to phase noise. To prove experimentally the usability of the proposed technique, two complementary LC differential VCOs with different damping conditions are fabricated using 0.18 /spl mu/m CMOS technology.

Efficiency is one of the key requirements, but it is usually obtained at the expense of large device stress. The latter can be reduced by introducing a cascode solution, which features an efficiency penalty due to dissipative mechanisms associated with MOS capacitive parasitics, overlooked up to date. A class-E PA is proposed which allows simultaneously high efficiency and reduced stress by means of an integrated inductor tuning out the parasitic. Prototypes, realized in a 0.13 /spl mu/m CMOS technology, demonstrate 67% PAE while delivering 23 dBm peak power at 1.7 GHz. PAE is still above 60% within the range 1.4-2 GHz.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/1489832/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 June 2005","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"12-14 June 2005","htmlLink":"/document/1489832/","dateOfInsertion":"08 August 2005","publicationDate":"2005","accessionNumber":"8479171","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A 1.4 GHz-2 GHz wideband CMOS class-E power amplifier delivering 23 dBm peak with 67% PAE","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A 1.4 GHz-2 GHz wideband CMOS class-E power amplifier delivering 23 dBm peak with 67% PAE","confLoc":"Long Beach, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"01489832.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.181855S","chronDate":"12-14 June 2005","xplore-pub-id":"9955","isNumber":"32008","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9955","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"32008","articleId":"1489832","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2005","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":1489833,"authors":[{"name":"A.

A minimum noise figure is 3.05 dB at 3 GHz and increases to 4.5 dB at 10 GHz. All these results are comparable to that of conventional LNAs with an emitter degenerated inductor, but this resistive feedback LNA has the advantage of die area over previous wideband LNAs due to the lack of a spiral inductor.

In order to address the amount of different content types, MPEG-21 digital item adaptation (DIA) introduces interoperable description tools which enable coding format independent adaptation. Bandwidth-efficient transport of the content to terminals with different capabilities and through a variety of access networks with various characteristics requires adaptation facilities not only on the server, but also within the network. We present transport mechanisms for MPEG-21-based metadata enabling generic adaptation within the network. Three different transport mechanisms for delivering this metadata in conjunction with the corresponding multimedia content are evaluated and a payload format for the transport of this metadata is presented. We performed measurements which demonstrate the bandwidth benefits of our distributed adaptation approach compared to server-centric adaptation in a multicast scenario. Finally, we applied various encoding formats for the metadata which further reduces the metadata overhead.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=32023","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MSAN.2005.1489936","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/01489936.png","publicationTitle":"2005 1st International Conference on Multimedia Services Access Networks, 2005.

An application scenario related to WLAN transmission has been considered in order to assess the proposed MAC methodology. Available radio resources (i.e. the orthogonal subchannels) are selectively attributed to transmitting users depending on their achieved performance at the MAC level, measured by an \"intelligent\" access point (AP). When the quality level is not satisfactory for one or more users, the AP issues a decrease of the data rate for such users while providing them with an increased number of subcarriers, in order to guarantee a lower bitrate fostered against frequency-selective channel distortions. Performance is evaluated through extensive simulation, demonstrating the good performance and high flexibility of the approach.","doi":"10.1109/MSAN.2005.1489950","publicationTitle":"2005 1st International Conference on Multimedia Services Access Networks, 2005.
