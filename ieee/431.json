Pattern recognition methods are usually designed to deal with perfect data, but in the real world data elements are often missing due to error, equipment failure, change of plans, etc. Six methods of dealing with blanks are tested on five data sets. Blanks were inserted at random locations into the data sets. A version of the K-nearest neighbor technique was used to classify the data and evaluate the six methods. Two methods were found to be consistently poor. Four methods were found to be generally good.

In many practical situations it is desirable to have objective measures which closely mirror the performance of the human viewer; today we lack accurate measures. To study this problem, a set of five pictures was used in which distortions of different types were introduced. The resulting series of pictures was rated by viewers by means of an impairment rating test. These ratings were then compared with various objective measures of the error. The objective measure is sought which is most closely monotonically related in a smooth manner to the subjective measure. The average spread of the subjective deviations about a polynomial regression of the subjective measure onto the objective measure is used as the criterion. This technique is used to study both linearly filtered error measures and picture dependent nonlinear weightings of the error. The procedure has enabled a crude quantative model of the human viewer to be determined.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSMC.1979.4310129","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4310123","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/21/4310123/04310129.pdf","endPage":"793","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Distortion Criteria of the Human Viewer","doi":"10.1109/TSMC.1979.4310129","startPage":"778","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4310129","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1979","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1979","displayDocTitle":"Distortion Criteria of the Human Viewer","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4310129/","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2007","publicationDate":"Dec. 1979","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"9","issue":"12","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distortion Criteria of the Human Viewer","sourcePdf":"TSMC-v9-n12-6.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.043877S","chronDate":"Dec.  1979","isNumber":"4310123","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"21","citationCount":"89","articleId":"4310129","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1979","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":4310152,"authors":[{"name":"Tokuji Okada","affiliation":["Electrotechnical Laboratory, Japanese Government, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Tokuji","lastName":"Okada","id":"37705804800"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9472"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2168-2909"}],"articleNumber":"4310152","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":110,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":430},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Systems, Man, and Cybernetics Society","url":"http://www.ieeesmc.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4310152","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fingers","Torque control","Control systems","Hardware","Servomechanisms","Turning","Humans","Kinematics","Equations","Force control"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TSMC.1979.4310152","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/21/4310148/04310152.pdf","startPage":"79","endPage":"89","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSMC.1979.4310152","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4310148","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Object-Handling System for Manual Industry","abstract":"An object-handling system for manual industry is described. This system is designed to have a compact structure and to accomplish multiple prehension and flexible motion for manual tasks. The system has three fingers which have structures similar to those of a human. Namely, these fingers are composed of three, four, and four joints, respectively, and can perform not only such simple motions as bending and extending but also such lateral flexing motions as adduction and abduction. The kinematics of the system is discussed in a rectangular coordinate system. The general solution for the finger joint is obtained by solving a fourth-degree equation. The control mode of each finger joint is suitably changed between position and torque control, and each joint is controlled by a hardware servo system. Cooperative motions among the fingers are easily realized by means of the hardware servo system. In an experiment of swing motion, cooperative motion based on a force control is accomplished between the right and left fingers without dropping the object.

Nevertheless, the evident superiority of biological systems in this regard has motivated a number of theoretical studies over the past decade which have now reached a state of maturity sufficient to permit the construction of experimental computer-controlled adaptive walking machines. At least two such vehicles are known to have recently demonstrated legged locomotion over smooth hard-surfaced terrain. This paper is concerned with an extension of the present theory of limb coordination for such machines to the case in which the terrain includes regions not suitable for weight-bearing and which must consequently be avoided by the control computer in deciding when and where to successively place the feet of the vehicle. The paper includes a complete problem formalization, a heuristic algorithm for solution of the problem thus posed, and a preliminary evaluation of the proposed algorithm in terms of a computer simulation study.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  1979","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4310180/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"April  1979","isJournal":true,"volume":"9","issue":"4","publicationDate":"April 1979","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive Locomotion of a Multilegged Robot over Rough Terrain","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive Locomotion of a Multilegged Robot over Rough Terrain","sourcePdf":"TSMC-v9-n4-4.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.028286S","chronDate":"April  1979","isNumber":"4310176","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"21","citationCount":"293","articleId":"4310180","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1979","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-18"},{"_id":4310204,"authors":[{"name":"H.

With the advent of communications among operations control center computers, real-time telemetered data can be exchanged for complete network modeling. Measurement time skew is a consideration when combining large area data received via a data communication network. In order to accommodate the effects of randomly varying arrival of measurement data, this paper presents an implementation of a stochastic extended Kalman filter (EKF) algorithm, which provides optimal estimates of interconnected network states for systems in which some or all measurements are delayed. The method relies on the delay statistics of exchanged data arrival at the control center and the delay is assumed to have binary statistics, i.e., either the measurements arrive in time or they are delayed by one time sample.

These make the SDFT more accurate than conventional DFT-based techniques. In addition, this method is recursive and easy to implement, so it is suitable for use in real time.

Recently, the wavelet transform (WT) has been successfully applied in many fields. The technique is based on utilising the absolute sum value of coefficients in multiresolution signal decomposition (MSD) based on the discrete wavelet transform (DWT). A fault indicator and fault criteria are then used to detect the HIF in transmission line. In order to discriminate between HIF and non-fault transient phenomena such as capacitor and line switching and arc furnace loads, the concept of duration time, i.e. the transient time period, is presented. On the basis of extensive investigations, optimal mother wavelets for the detection of HIF are chosen. It is shown that the technique developed is robust to fault type, fault-inception angle, fault resistance and fault location. The paper demonstrates a new concept and methodology in HIT in transmission lines. The performance of the proposed technique is tested under a variety of fault conditions on a typical 154kV Korean transmission line system.","doi":"10.1109/MPER.2002.4312420","publicationTitle":"IEEE Power Engineering Review","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Power Engineering Review","pdfPath":"/iel5/39/21879/04312420.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MPER.2002.4312420","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=21879","startPage":"61","endPage":"61","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Novel Fault Detection Techique of High Impedance Arcing Faults in Transmission Lines Using the Wavelet Transform","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4312420","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A Novel Fault Detection Techique of High Impedance Arcing Faults in Transmission Lines Using the Wavelet Transform","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4312420/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"July  2002","isJournal":true,"volume":"22","issue":"7","publicationDate":"July 2002","dateOfInsertion":"24 September 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Novel Fault Detection Techique of High Impedance Arcing Faults in Transmission Lines Using the Wavelet Transform","sourcePdf":"MPER-v22-n7-102.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.031712S","chronDate":"July  2002","isNumber":"21879","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"39","citationCount":"2","articleId":"4312420","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":4312468,"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0272-1724"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-1705"}],"articleNumber":"4312468","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":31,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1075},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Power & Energy Society","url":"http://www.ieee.org/organizations/society/power/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Partial discharges","Power transformers","Fault location","UHF measurements","Geographic Information Systems","Frequency","Power transformer insulation","Pulse measurements","Pulse transformers","Signal analysis"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Applying UHF Partial Discharge Detection to Power Transformers","publicationTitle":"IEEE Power Engineering Review","doi":"10.1109/MPER.2002.4312468","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Power Engineering Review","pdfPath":"/iel5/39/21976/04312468.pdf","startPage":"57","endPage":"59","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MPER.2002.4312468","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=21976","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4312468","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4312468/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug.  2002","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2002","displayDocTitle":"Applying UHF Partial Discharge Detection to Power Transformers","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"22","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/4312468/","dateOfInsertion":"24 September 2007","publicationDate":"Aug. 2002","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Applying UHF Partial Discharge Detection to Power Transformers","sourcePdf":"MPER-v22-n8-37.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.035638S","chronDate":"Aug.  2002","xplore-pub-id":"39","isNumber":"21976","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"39","citationCount":"31","xplore-issue":"21976","articleId":"4312468","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4312668,"authors":[{"name":"Loukianos Gatzoulis","affiliation":["ICT for Health Unit, European Commission"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/51/4303486/4312668/4312668-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Loukianos Gatzoulis is a Scientific Officer at the ICT for Health Unit of the European Commission.

The most important requirement arising from this is the need for interoperability between PHMSs and HISs/EHRs.

Current NIDS do not consider the two main detection paradigms, i.e. misuse detection and anomaly detection, in an unified style, so the analysis is not inherently complete. Besides, historical data are not generally used, neither for analysis nor for sequential adaptation of the knowledge representation models used for detection; hence this wealthy information about the essence and the potential trends of the target system is not commonly considered. Thus, by the generalized use of Bayesian belief networks, ESIDE-Depian achieves the main goal of detecting and preventing both well-known and also zero-day attacks with excellent results, by means of unified real-time analysis of network traffic.","doi":"10.1109/DEXA.2007.38","publicationTitle":"18th International Workshop on Database and Expert Systems Applications (DEXA 2007)","displayPublicationTitle":"18th International Workshop on Database and Expert Systems Applications (DEXA 2007)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4312838/4312839/04312918.pdf","startPage":"365","endPage":"371","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DEXA.2007.38","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4312839","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Intensive Use of Bayesian Belief Networks for the Unified, Flexible and Adaptable Analysis of Misuses and Anomalies in Network Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4312918","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-7 Sept. 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4312918/","displayDocTitle":"Intensive Use of Bayesian Belief Networks for the Unified, Flexible and Adaptable Analysis of Misuses and Anomalies in Network Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2007","accessionNumber":"9876559","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4312918/","conferenceDate":"3-7 Sept. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"24 September 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Intensive Use of Bayesian Belief Networks for the Unified, Flexible and Adaptable Analysis of Misuses and Anomalies in Network Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems","confLoc":"Regensburg, Germany","sourcePdf":"29320365.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066761S","chronDate":"3-7 Sept. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4312838","isNumber":"4312839","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4312838","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"4312839","articleId":"4312918","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4312922,"authors":[{"name":"Giulia Bruno","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Automatica e Informatica, Politecnico di Turino, Italy"],"firstName":"Giulia","lastName":"Bruno","id":"37287942700"},{"name":"Paolo Garza","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Automatica e Informatica, Politecnico di Turino, Italy"],"firstName":"Paolo","lastName":"Garza","id":"37541709200"},{"name":"Elisa Quintarelli","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Elettronica e Informazione, Politecnico di Milano, Italy"],"firstName":"Elisa","lastName":"Quintarelli","id":"37705446400"},{"name":"Rosalba Rossato","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Elettronica e Informazione, Politecnico di Milano, Italy"],"firstName":"Rosalba","lastName":"Rossato","id":"37423424700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7695-2932-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-2932-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1529-4188"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2378-3915"}],"articleNumber":"4312922","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":154},"abstract":"Anomaly detection has the double purpose of discovering interesting exceptions and identifying incorrect data in huge amounts of data. Since anomalies are rare events which violate the frequent relationships among data, we propose a method to detect frequent relationships and then extract anomalies. The RADAR (Research of Anomalous Data through Association Rules) method is based on data mining techniques to extract frequent \"rules\" from datasets, in the form of quasi-functional dependencies. Such dependencies are extracted by using association rules. Given a quasi-functional dependency, we can discover the associated anomalies by querying either the original database or the association rules previously mined. The analysis on this kind of anomaly can either derive the presence of erroneous data or highlight novel information which represents significant outliers of frequent rules. Our method does not require any previous knowledge and directly infers rules from the data. Experiments performed on real XML databases are reported to show the applicability and effectiveness of the proposed approach.","displayPublicationTitle":"18th International Workshop on Database and Expert Systems Applications (DEXA 2007)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4312838/4312839/04312922.pdf","startPage":"387","endPage":"391","publicationTitle":"18th International Workshop on Database and Expert Systems Applications (DEXA 2007)","doi":"10.1109/DEXA.2007.68","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DEXA.2007.68","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4312839","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4312922","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Anomaly Detection in XML databases by means of Association Rules","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["XML","Association rules","Data mining","Radar detection","Data analysis","Information analysis","Relational databases","Expert systems","Event detection","Error correction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data mining","database management systems","security of data","XML"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["XML database anomaly detection","association rules","RADAR","data mining technique","frequent rule extraction","quasi functional dependency"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4312922/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-7 Sept. 2007","displayDocTitle":"Anomaly Detection in XML databases by means of Association Rules","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4312922/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2007","accessionNumber":"9876563","dateOfInsertion":"24 September 2007","conferenceDate":"3-7 Sept. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Anomaly Detection in XML databases by means of Association Rules","confLoc":"Regensburg, Germany","sourcePdf":"29320387.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069955S","chronDate":"3-7 Sept. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4312838","isNumber":"4312839","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4312838","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4312839","articleId":"4312922","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4312938,"authors":[{"name":"Yoo Jung An","affiliation":["New Jersey Institute of Technology, USA"],"firstName":"Yoo Jung","lastName":"An","id":"38186117900"},{"name":"James Geller","affiliation":["New Jersey Institute of Technology, USA"],"firstName":"James","lastName":"Geller","id":"37283154800"},{"name":"Yi-Ta Wu","affiliation":["University of Michigan, USA"],"firstName":"Yi-Ta","lastName":"Wu","id":"37068824700"},{"name":"Soon Ae Chun","affiliation":[" City College and Graduate Center, City University of New York, USA"],"firstName":"Soon Ae","lastName":"Chun","id":"37276613100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7695-2932-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-2932-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1529-4188"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2378-3915"}],"articleNumber":"4312938","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":16,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":522},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4312938","abstract":"The term \"deep Web\" refers to Web pages that are not accessible to search engines, e.g., because those Web pages are dynamically generated in response to queries through Web forms or Web services. The existing automated Web crawlers cannot index these pages, thus they are hidden from the Web search engines. Our goal is to properly annotate such deep Web services (i.e. content generation interfaces of hidden Web sources) with semantic indexing by constructing domain-specific ontologies to represent the contents of the deep Web sources. The fully automatic derivation of ontologies from Web sources without human review is to date a challenging research issue. We present a novel approach to automatically building a large, yet domain-specific, ontology by interweaving sub-taxonomies of WordNet with domain-specific information extracted from deep Web service pages. Our algorithms extract domain concepts from deep Web sources which are augmented with concepts and relationships from WordNet to construct ontology fragments. Structurally, these are directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). An iterative process of extracting WordNet concepts and relationships and bridging concept gaps is used to tie together disparate domain concepts and ontology fragments into one ontology. Using eight domains (airfares, jobs, etc.) from a well-known test-bed, our algorithms constructed an ontology of 1692 concepts from deep Web sources and 4434 concepts from WordNet. This ontology is expressed in the OWL format to support semantic Web searches.","doi":"10.1109/DEXA.2007.43","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4312839","startPage":"470","endPage":"474","pdfPath":"/iel5/4312838/4312839/04312938.pdf","publicationTitle":"18th International Workshop on Database and Expert Systems Applications (DEXA 2007)","displayPublicationTitle":"18th International Workshop on Database and Expert Systems Applications (DEXA 2007)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DEXA.2007.43","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Automatic Generation of Ontology from the Deep Web","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Ontologies","Web services","Data mining","Web pages","Search engines","Iterative algorithms","Crawlers","Web search","Indexing","Humans"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["directed graphs","indexing","iterative methods","ontologies (artificial intelligence)","search engines","Web services"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ontology generation","Web pages","search engines","Web forms","Web crawlers","deep Web services","semantic indexing","domain-specific ontologies","directed acyclic graphs","iterative process","WordNet concepts extraction","OWL format","semantic Web searching"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"3-7 Sept. 2007","displayDocTitle":"Automatic Generation of Ontology from the Deep Web","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4312938/","dateOfInsertion":"24 September 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4312938/","accessionNumber":"9876577","publicationDate":"Sept. 2007","conferenceDate":"3-7 Sept. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Automatic Generation of Ontology from the Deep Web","confLoc":"Regensburg, Germany","sourcePdf":"29320470.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066559S","chronDate":"3-7 Sept. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4312838","isNumber":"4312839","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4312838","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"4312839","articleId":"4312938","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4312986,"authors":[{"name":"Luis Zarza","affiliation":["Technical University of Mixteca, Mexico"],"firstName":"Luis","lastName":"Zarza","id":"37296818700"},{"name":"Josep Pegueroles","affiliation":["Technical University of Catalonia, Spain"],"firstName":"Josep","lastName":"Pegueroles","id":"37296821000"},{"name":"Miguel Soriano","affiliation":["Technical University of Catalonia, Spain"],"firstName":"Miguel","lastName":"Soriano","id":"37264913800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7695-2932-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-2932-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1529-4188"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2378-3915"}],"articleNumber":"4312986","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":50},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Security","Genetic algorithms","Cryptographic protocols","Genomics","Bioinformatics","Cryptography","Computer applications","Ad hoc networks","Electronic voting","Algorithm design and analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cryptographic protocols","genetic algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["binary strings interpretation","security protocols","genetic algorithms","cryptographic protocols","automated tool generating protocols","security networked protocols","optimizing protocols","genome definition","optimization method"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4312986","abstract":"The design of cryptographic and security protocols for new scenarios and applications can be computationally expensive.

First, we construct a special class of nonbinary LDPC cycle codes with low error floors. Our construction utilizes the cycle elimination algorithm to remove short cycles in the normal graph and to select nonzero elements in the parity-check matrix to reduce the number of low-weight codewords generated by short cycles. Furthermore, we show that simple modifications of such codes are parallel sparse encodable (PSE). The PSE code, consisting of a quasi-cyclic (QC) LDPC cycle code and a simple tree code, has the attractive feature that it is not only linearly encodable, but also allows parallel encoding which can reduce the encoding time significantly. We provide a systematic comparison between nonbinary coded systems and binary coded systems. For the MIMO channel considered, our results show that the proposed nonbinary system employing the PSE code outperforms not only the binary LDPC code specified in the 802.16e standard, but also the optimized binary LDPC code obtained using the EXIT chart methods.","doi":"10.1109/ITW.2007.4313042","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ITW.2007.4313042","startPage":"13","endPage":"18","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Information Theory Workshop","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Information Theory Workshop","pdfPath":"/iel5/4313033/4313034/04313042.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4313034","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design of Nonbinary Quasi-Cyclic LDPC Cycle Codes","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4313042/","conferenceDate":"2-6 Sept. 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-6 Sept. 2007","displayDocTitle":"Design of Nonbinary Quasi-Cyclic LDPC Cycle Codes","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"24 September 2007","accessionNumber":"9827037","publicationDate":"Sept. 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4313042/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design of Nonbinary Quasi-Cyclic LDPC Cycle Codes","confLoc":"Tahoe City, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"ITW-00-8.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058425S","chronDate":"2-6 Sept. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4313033","isNumber":"4313034","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4313033","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"4313034","articleId":"4313042","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4313043,"authors":[{"name":"Xiao Ma","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China"],"firstName":"Xiao","lastName":"Ma","id":"37279526900"},{"name":"Baoming Bai","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of ISN, Xidian University, Xi'an, Shaanxi, China"],"firstName":"Baoming","lastName":"Bai","id":"37290479800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-1563-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-1564-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4313043","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":109},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Partitioning algorithms","Linear code","Parity check codes","Iterative algorithms","Iterative decoding","Belief propagation","Sum product algorithm","Lakes","Sun","Galois fields"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","decoding","error statistics","graph theory","linear codes","matrix algebra","parity check codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["unified decoding algorithm","linear codes","partitioned parity-check matrices","doubly extended sum-product algorithm","generalized normal graph","frame-error-rate","bit-error-rate","decoding complexity"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we propose a unified decoding algorithm for linear codes, named doubly extended sum-product algorithm (DESPA).

We show that the SNR exponent of the optimal short-term scheme is given by the Singleton bound. We also illustrate the significant gains available by employing long-term power constraints. Due to the nature of the expressions involved, the complexity of optimal schemes may be prohibitive for system implementation.

The interference-free rate is thus achieved. However, this result relies on the perfectly known channel coefficients at the transmitter when being applied to the fading channel. We thus consider the fading paper problem where only the channel statistics information is available at the transmitter. In general, the optimal transmission strategies to achieve the capacity of this channel is still unknown. We confine ourselves to the linear-assignment Gel'fand-Pinsker coding which has been proved to have good, sometimes even optimal, performance in the a variety of fast and slow fading channels. However, lack of structured codebook so far limited the practical applications of this coding. In this paper, we present a lattice-based coding structure for the vector fading paper channel. It can achieve the rate performance of the linear-assignment strategies previously proved by the random Gaussian codebook. Moreover, the lattice codebook has an algebraic structure and is possible to be implemented in practice. The results can be applied to the emerging fields such as fading multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) Gaussian broadcast channels or fading MIMO cognitive channels.","doi":"10.1109/ITW.2007.4313053","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Information Theory Workshop","pdfPath":"/iel5/4313033/4313034/04313053.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4313034","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ITW.2007.4313053","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Information Theory Workshop","startPage":"78","endPage":"83","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Lattice coding for the vector fading paper problem","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4313053","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-6 Sept. 2007","displayDocTitle":"Lattice coding for the vector fading paper problem","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4313053/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4313053/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2007","accessionNumber":"9827048","dateOfInsertion":"24 September 2007","conferenceDate":"2-6 Sept. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Lattice coding for the vector fading paper problem","confLoc":"Tahoe City, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"ITW-00-19.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073718S","chronDate":"2-6 Sept. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4313033","isNumber":"4313034","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4313033","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"4313034","articleId":"4313053","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4313054,"authors":[{"name":"Shuchin Aeron","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Boston University, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Shuchin","lastName":"Aeron","id":"37283102000"},{"name":"Manqi Zhao","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Boston University, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Manqi","lastName":"Zhao","id":"37292301600"},{"name":"Venkatesh Saligrama","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Boston University, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Venkatesh","lastName":"Saligrama","id":"37301183700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-1563-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-1564-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4313054","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":216},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Capacitive sensors","Upper bound","Signal processing","Sensor phenomena and characterization","Compressed sensing","Distortion","Vectors","Rate-distortion","Quantization","Sufficient conditions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel capacity","diversity reception","probability","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["information theoretic bounds","sensing capacity","sensor networks","linear observation","fixed SNR models","compressed sensing problem","random Gaussian projections","distortion effects","continuous signal spaces","error probability","distortion criteria","max-likelihood detection","vector rate-distortion quantization points","sensing diversity","signal sparsity"]}],"abstract":"In this paper we address the problem of finding the sensing capacity of sensor networks for the class of linear observation and fixed SNR models. We define sensing capacity as the maximum number of signal dimensions that can be reliably identified per sensor/observation. In this context the sparsity of the signal plays an important role. Sensing capacity has direct implications for the so called compressed sensing problem, which involves reconstruction of sparse phenomena from random Gaussian projections. In this paper we adopt an information theoretic framework and develop upper and lower bounds for sensing capacity. We first extend Fano's inequality to incorporate distortion effects as well as continuous signal spaces. We use this modified version of the inequality to derive upper bounds to sensing capacity. Upper bounds to probability of error subject to a distortion criteria are derived under a max-likelihood detection set-up over the set of vector rate-distortion quantization points. Using the upper bound a sufficient condition is identified for reliable reconstruction that provides lower bounds to sensing capacity. For the case of linear observation model with Gaussian ensemble and under fixed SNR, our results show the following interesting behaviors : (A) Sensing Capacity is a function of SNR, distortion and sparsity; (B) Sensing capacity goes down to zero as sparsity goes down to zero, irrespective of SNR. We quantify the effect of sensing diversity (effective coverage per sensor) on sensing capacity and show that sufficiently large diversity can be traded off for SNR and signal sparsity. Also low sensing diversity implies low sensing capacity.","doi":"10.1109/ITW.2007.4313054","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Information Theory Workshop","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Information Theory Workshop","pdfPath":"/iel5/4313033/4313034/04313054.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ITW.2007.4313054","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4313034","startPage":"84","endPage":"89","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Information theoretic bounds to sensing capacity of sensor networks under fixed SNR","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4313054","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Information theoretic bounds to sensing capacity of sensor networks under fixed SNR","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-6 Sept. 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4313054/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"2-6 Sept. 2007","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2007","accessionNumber":"9827049","dateOfInsertion":"24 September 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4313054/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Information theoretic bounds to sensing capacity of sensor networks under fixed SNR","confLoc":"Tahoe City, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"ITW-00-20.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050384S","chronDate":"2-6 Sept. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4313033","isNumber":"4313034","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4313033","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"4313034","articleId":"4313054","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":4313060,"authors":[{"name":"Salim Y.

It has been recently shown that network coding technique can significantly increase the overall throughput of wireless networks by taking advantage of their broadcast nature. In wireless networks, each transmitted packet is broadcasted within a certain area and can be overheard by the neighboring nodes. When a node needs to transmit packets, it employs the opportunistic coding approach that uses the knowledge of what the node's neighbors have heard in order to reduce the number of transmissions. With this approach, each transmitted packet is a linear combination of the original packets over a certain finite field. In this paper, we focus on the fundamental problem of finding the optimal encoding for the broadcasted packets that minimizes the overall number of transmissions. We show that this problem is NP-complete over GF(2) and establish several fundamental properties of the optimal solution. We also propose a simple heuristic solution for the problem based on graph coloring and present some empirical results for random settings.","doi":"10.1109/ITW.2007.4313060","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Information Theory Workshop","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Information Theory Workshop","pdfPath":"/iel5/4313033/4313034/04313060.pdf","startPage":"120","endPage":"125","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ITW.2007.4313060","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4313034","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the Minimum Number of Transmissions in Single-Hop Wireless Coding Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4313060","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-6 Sept. 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4313060/","displayDocTitle":"On the Minimum Number of Transmissions in Single-Hop Wireless Coding Networks","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2007","accessionNumber":"9827055","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4313060/","conferenceDate":"2-6 Sept. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"24 September 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the Minimum Number of Transmissions in Single-Hop Wireless Coding Networks","confLoc":"Tahoe City, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"ITW-00-26.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071215S","chronDate":"2-6 Sept. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4313033","isNumber":"4313034","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4313033","citationCount":"91","xplore-issue":"4313034","articleId":"4313060","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4313061,"authors":[{"name":"Shashi Kiran Chilappagari","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Arizona Tucson, Tucson, AZ, USA"],"firstName":"Shashi Kiran","lastName":"Chilappagari","id":"37321432800"},{"name":"Bane Vasic","affiliation":["Department of ECE and Department of Mathematics, University of Arizona Tucson, Tucson, AZ, USA"],"firstName":"Bane","lastName":"Vasic","id":"37845708800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-1563-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-1564-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4313061","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":19,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":79},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4313061","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fault tolerance","Graph theory","Circuit faults","Parity check codes","Decoding","Redundancy","Memory architecture","Error correction codes","Lakes","Mathematics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["failure analysis","fault tolerance","graph theory","parity check codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fault tolerant memories","expander graphs","transient faults","LDPC codes","failures constant fraction","Tanner graph"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ITW.2007.4313061","endPage":"131","startPage":"126","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Information Theory Workshop","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Information Theory Workshop","pdfPath":"/iel5/4313033/4313034/04313061.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ITW.2007.4313061","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4313034","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fault Tolerant Memories Based on Expander Graphs","abstract":"In this paper we consider memories built from components subject to transient faults.

However, the minimum Hamming distance (MHD) of a turbo code may not be sufficient to prevent a detrimental change in the error rate vs. signal to noise ratio curve, the so-called \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">flattening</i>\n. Increasing the MHD of a turbo code may involve using component encoders with a large number of states, devising more sophisticated internal permutations, or increasing the dimension of the turbo code, i.e. the number of component encoders. This paper addresses the latter option and proposes a modified turbo code, in which some of the parity bits stemming from the classical component encoders are encoded by a rate-1, third encoder. The result is a significantly increased MHD, which improves turbo decoder performance at low error rates, at the expense of a very small increase in complexity. In this paper, we compare the performance of the proposed turbo code with that of the DVB-RCS turbo code and the DVB-S2 LDPC code. Comparisons with more complex 16-state TCs are also reported.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Turbo codes","Magnetohydrodynamics","Decoding","Error analysis","Digital video broadcasting","Message passing","Error correction","Hamming distance","Signal to noise ratio","Parity check codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["codecs","digital video broadcasting","Hamming codes","turbo codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["modified turbo code","classical component encoders","minimum Hamming distance","MHD","turbo decoder performance","DVB-RCS turbo code","DVB-S2 LDPC code"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4313066","doi":"10.1109/ITW.2007.4313066","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Information Theory Workshop","pdfPath":"/iel5/4313033/4313034/04313066.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ITW.2007.4313066","startPage":"156","endPage":"161","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4313034","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Information Theory Workshop","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adding a Rate-1 Third Dimension to Turbo Codes","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Adding a Rate-1 Third Dimension to Turbo Codes","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4313066/","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"2-6 Sept. 2007","conferenceDate":"2-6 Sept. 2007","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4313066/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"24 September 2007","publicationDate":"Sept. 2007","accessionNumber":"9827060","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adding a Rate-1 Third Dimension to Turbo Codes","confLoc":"Tahoe City, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"ITW-00-32.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041975S","chronDate":"2-6 Sept. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4313033","isNumber":"4313034","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4313033","citationCount":"28","xplore-issue":"4313034","articleId":"4313066","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4313069,"authors":[{"name":"Jorn Justesen","affiliation":["COM, Technical University of Denmark, Kongens Lyngby, Denmark"],"firstName":"Jorn","lastName":"Justesen","id":"37283164900"},{"name":"Tom Hoholdt","affiliation":["Department of Mathematics, Technical University of Denmark, Kongens Lyngby, Denmark"],"firstName":"Tom","lastName":"Hoholdt","id":"37326008500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-1563-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-1564-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4313069","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":21,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":251},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4313069","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Iterative decoding","Product codes","Reed-Solomon codes","Error correction codes","Bipartite graph","Performance analysis","Graph theory","Lakes","Error correction","Mathematics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["iterative decoding","Reed-Solomon codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["iterated hard decision decoding","product codes","Reed-Solomon component codes","random graphs","minimum distance decoding"]}],"abstract":"Products of Reed-Solomon codes are important in applications because they offer a combination of large blocks, low decoding complexity, and good performance.

We observe that the concentration of the performance of the decoder around its average performance continues to hold when noise is introduced into message-passing. Given the concentration result, density evolution equations for a simple noisy message-passing decoder are derived.

There also seems to be a fundamental relationship of MS decoding with the linear programming decoder [2]. Despite its importance, its fundamental properties have not nearly been studied as well as those of the sum-product (also known as BP) algorithm. We address two questions related to the MS rule. First, we characterize the stability condition under MS decoding. It turns out to be essentially the same condition as under BP decoding. Second, we perform a degree distribution optimization. Contrary to the case of BP decoding, under MS decoding the thresholds of the best degree distributions for standard irregular LDPC ensembles are significantly bounded away from the Shannon threshold. More precisely, on the AWGN channel, for the best codes that we find, the gap to capacity is 1 dB for a rate 0.3 code and it is 0.4 dB when the rate is 0.9 (the gap decreases monotonically as we increase the rate). We also used the optimization procedure to design codes for modified MS algorithm where the output of the check node is scaled by a constant 1/alpha. For alpha = 1.25, we observed that the gap to capacity was lesser for the modified MS algorithm when compared with the MS algorithm. However, it was still quite large, varying from 0.75 dB to 0.2 dB for rates between 0.3 and 0.9. We conclude by posing what we consider to be the most important open questions related to the MS algorithm.","doi":"10.1109/ITW.2007.4313072","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Information Theory Workshop","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Information Theory Workshop","pdfPath":"/iel5/4313033/4313034/04313072.pdf","startPage":"190","endPage":"195","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ITW.2007.4313072","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4313034","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Degree Optimization and Stability Condition for the Min-Sum Decoder","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4313072","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-6 Sept. 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4313072/","displayDocTitle":"Degree Optimization and Stability Condition for the Min-Sum Decoder","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2007","accessionNumber":"9827066","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4313072/","conferenceDate":"2-6 Sept. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"24 September 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Degree Optimization and Stability Condition for the Min-Sum Decoder","confLoc":"Tahoe City, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"ITW-00-38.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.037943S","chronDate":"2-6 Sept. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4313033","isNumber":"4313034","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4313033","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4313034","articleId":"4313072","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4313073,"authors":[{"name":"Pulkit Grover","affiliation":["Wireless Foundations, EECS Department, University of California Berkeley, USA"],"firstName":"Pulkit","lastName":"Grover","id":"37398027100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-1563-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-1564-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4313073","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":210},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Parity check codes","Channel capacity","H infinity control","Iterative decoding","Capacity planning","Circuits","Lakes","Belief propagation","Concatenated codes","Upper bound"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel capacity","computational complexity","decoding","graph theory","parity check codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["sparse-graph codes","per bit decoding complexity","channel capacity","binary symmetric channel","belief propagation decoding","LDPC","LDGM","bounded decoding complexity"]}],"abstract":"Khandekar and McEliece suggested the problem of per bit decoding complexity for capacity achieving sparse-graph codes as a function of their gap from the channel capacity.

For bounded degree LDPC and LDGM codes, any concatenation of the two, and punctured bounded-degree LDPC codes, this reduces to a lower bound of O (log (1/isin-)). The proof of this result leads to an interesting necessary condition on the code structures which could achieve capacity with bounded decoding complexity over BSC: the average edge-degree must converge to infinity while the average node-degree must be bounded.

The message-passing schedule of the BP algorithm significantly affects the performance of the LDPC decoder. The authors recently presented a novel message-passing schedule, called Informed Dynamic Scheduling (IDS), that selects the message-passing schedule according to the observed rate of change of the messages. IDS yields a lower error-rate performance than traditional message-passing schedules (such as flooding and LBP) because it solves traditional trapping-set errors. However, for short-blocklength LDPC codes, IDS algorithms present non-trapping-set errors in the error floor region. This paper presents a careful analysis of those errors and proposes mixed scheduling strategies, combining LBP with IDS, that solve these non-trapping-set errors. Also, we will show that some lower-complexity techniques, such as mixed scheduling, perform close to the best IDS strategies for larger-blocklength codes.","doi":"10.1109/ITW.2007.4313075","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Information Theory Workshop","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Information Theory Workshop","pdfPath":"/iel5/4313033/4313034/04313075.pdf","startPage":"208","endPage":"213","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ITW.2007.4313075","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4313034","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improving LDPC Decoders via Informed Dynamic Scheduling","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"2-6 Sept. 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4313075/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-6 Sept. 2007","displayDocTitle":"Improving LDPC Decoders via Informed Dynamic Scheduling","dateOfInsertion":"24 September 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4313075/","accessionNumber":"9827069","publicationDate":"Sept. 2007","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improving LDPC Decoders via Informed Dynamic Scheduling","confLoc":"Tahoe City, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"ITW-00-41.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045772S","chronDate":"2-6 Sept. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4313033","isNumber":"4313034","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4313033","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"4313034","articleId":"4313075","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4313078,"authors":[{"name":"Kyomin Jung","affiliation":["Mathematics, MIT, Cambridge, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Kyomin","lastName":"Jung","id":"38192822100"},{"name":"Devavrat Shah","affiliation":["EECS, MIT, Cambridge, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Devavrat","lastName":"Shah","id":"37283901000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-1563-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-1564-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4313078","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":4,"totalDownloads":114},"abstract":"In a recent result, Weitz (D.

Analogous result for max-marginal distribution holds for the reason that addition and multiplication commute in the same way as addition and maximum. This remarkable connection suggests a message-passing algorithm for computing exact marginal and max-marginal in any binary MRF \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">G</i>\n. In this paper, we exploit this property along with appropriate graph partitioning scheme to design approximate message passing algorithms for computing max-marginal of nodes or maximum a-posteriori assignment (MAP) in a binary MRF G. Our algorithm can provide provably arbitrarily small error for a large class of graphs including planar graphs. Our algorithms are linear in number of nodes G with constant dependent on the approximation error. For precise evaluation of computation cost of algorithm, we obtain a novel tight characterization of the size of self-avoiding walk tree for any connected graph as a function of number of edges and nodes.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Inference algorithms","Partitioning algorithms","Markov random fields","Algorithm design and analysis","Message passing","Maximum a posteriori estimation","Approximation algorithms","Approximation error","Cost function","Computational efficiency"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["interference (signal)","Markov processes","maximum likelihood estimation","message passing","minimax techniques","trees (mathematics)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["approximate message-passing inference algorithm","binary pair-wise Markov random field","self-avoid walk tree","max-marginal distribution holds","graph partitioning scheme","maximum a-posteriori assignment","planar graphs","approximation error"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ITW.2007.4313078","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Information Theory Workshop","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Information Theory Workshop","pdfPath":"/iel5/4313033/4313034/04313078.pdf","startPage":"224","endPage":"229","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4313034","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ITW.2007.4313078","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Approximate message-passing inference algorithm","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4313078","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Approximate message-passing inference algorithm","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4313078/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4313078/","accessionNumber":"9827072","conferenceDate":"2-6 Sept. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"24 September 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-6 Sept. 2007","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Approximate message-passing inference algorithm","confLoc":"Tahoe City, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"ITW-00-44.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060777S","chronDate":"2-6 Sept. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4313033","isNumber":"4313034","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4313033","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4313034","articleId":"4313078","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":4313079,"authors":[{"name":"Michael Chertkov","affiliation":["Center for Nonlinear Studies & Theory Division, Los Alamos National Laboratory, Los Alamos, NM, USA"],"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Chertkov","id":"37396932400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-1563-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-1564-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4313079","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":16,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":93},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Maximum likelihood decoding","Iterative decoding","Calculus","Parity check codes","1f noise","Partitioning algorithms","Lakes","Linear programming","Laboratories","Analytical models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decoding","graph theory","linear programming"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decoding","graph based codes","error-floor domain","linear programming","loop calculus approach"]}],"abstract":"We discuss how the loop calculus approach of [Chertkov, Chernyak '06], enhanced by the pseudo-codeword search algorithm of [Chertkov, Stepanov '06] and the facet-guessing idea from [Dimakis, Wainwright '06], improves decoding of graph based codes in the error-floor domain.

Practical codes that can achieve the Shannon limit are codes defined on graphs with its associated iterative decoding algorithms. Yet, the complexity of these algorithms is high, especially for long codes that attain capacity. For the foreseeable future, algebraic decoding will still be a standard in industry. We aim to harness the power of iterative processes and the low complexity of algebraic techniques by decoding codes on graphs using iterative algebraic techniques. We study the performance of codes on graphs decoded with this method taking into account the case of undetected errors. More specifically, we examine the threshold under which decoding is successful for the BEC and the BSC and compare these with that of certain LDPC codes. Our initial investigation shows that although a significant loss of performance is incurred on the BEC when compared to belief propagation decoding, for transmission over the BSC the threshold value is somewhat close to belief propagation. Especially for high rate codes iterative algebraic decoding could have good performance while maintaining low decoding complexity.","doi":"10.1109/ITW.2007.4313083","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ITW.2007.4313083","startPage":"254","endPage":"259","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Information Theory Workshop","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Information Theory Workshop","pdfPath":"/iel5/4313033/4313034/04313083.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4313034","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance of Iterative Algebraic Decoding of Codes Defined on Graphs: An Initial Investigation","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4313083/","conferenceDate":"2-6 Sept. 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-6 Sept. 2007","displayDocTitle":"Performance of Iterative Algebraic Decoding of Codes Defined on Graphs: An Initial Investigation","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"24 September 2007","accessionNumber":"9827077","publicationDate":"Sept. 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4313083/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance of Iterative Algebraic Decoding of Codes Defined on Graphs: An Initial Investigation","confLoc":"Tahoe City, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"ITW-00-49.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057481S","chronDate":"2-6 Sept. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4313033","isNumber":"4313034","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4313033","citationCount":"59","xplore-issue":"4313034","articleId":"4313083","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4313084,"authors":[{"name":"Bobak Nazer","affiliation":["Wireless Foundations Research Center, Department of EECS, University of California Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Bobak","lastName":"Nazer","id":"38482531700"},{"name":"Michael Gastpar","affiliation":["Wireless Foundations Research Center, Department of EECS, University of California Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Gastpar","id":"37273006200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-1563-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-1564-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4313084","dbTime":"26 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":19,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":303},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Maximum likelihood decoding","Linear code","Source coding","Relays","Channel capacity","Degradation","Lattices","Lakes","Reliability theory","Telecommunication network reliability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel coding","multi-access systems","random codes","relays","source coding","telecommunication channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["structured codes","random codes","Shannon-theoretic analysis","joint source-channel coding","noisy channels","ergodic point-to-point problems","fidelity criteria","multiple-access channel","source coding","linear codes","channel coding","relays"]}],"abstract":"In the Shannon-theoretic analysis of joint source-channel coding problems, achievability is usually established via a two-stage approach: The sources are compressed into bits, and these bits are reliably communicated across the noisy channels. Random coding arguments are the backbone of both stages of the proof. This strategy not only establishes the optimal performance for stationary ergodic point-to-point problems, but also for a number of simple network situations, such as independent sources that are communicated with respect to separate fidelity criteria across a multiple-access channel. Beyond such simple cases, for general networks, unstructured random coding arguments are not sufficient. This was first realized for source coding by Korner and Marton, who showed that for a distributed souce coding problem where one only needs to recover a function of the sources random linear codes are necessary. The goal of this note is to extend this insight to pure channel coding as well as to joint source-channel coding problems, such as the problem of reliable computation over a multiple-access channel and a multi-access network with relays.","doi":"10.1109/ITW.2007.4313084","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Information Theory Workshop","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Information Theory Workshop","pdfPath":"/iel5/4313033/4313034/04313084.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ITW.2007.4313084","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4313034","startPage":"260","endPage":"265","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The Case for Structured Random Codes in Network Communication Theorems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4313084","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"The Case for Structured Random Codes in Network Communication Theorems","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-6 Sept. 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4313084/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"2-6 Sept. 2007","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2007","accessionNumber":"9827078","dateOfInsertion":"24 September 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4313084/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Case for Structured Random Codes in Network Communication Theorems","confLoc":"Tahoe City, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"ITW-00-50.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056667S","chronDate":"2-6 Sept. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4313033","isNumber":"4313034","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4313033","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"4313034","articleId":"4313084","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4313090,"authors":[{"name":"Yang Yang","affiliation":["Dept of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Texas A and M University, College Station, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Yang","lastName":"Yang","id":"37310961400"},{"name":"Vladimir Stankovic","affiliation":["Dept of Communication Systems, Lancaster University, Lancaster, UK"],"firstName":"Vladimir","lastName":"Stankovic","id":"37392809100"},{"name":"Zixiang Xiong","affiliation":["Dept of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Texas A and M University, College Station, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Zixiang","lastName":"Xiong","id":"37278484800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-1563-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-1564-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4313090","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":144},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cryptography","Data encapsulation","Image coding","Decoding","Data security","Information security","Multimedia systems","Discrete cosine transforms","Protection","Source coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cryptography","discrete cosine transforms","parity check codes","quantisation (signal)","trellis codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image encryption","data hiding","duality designs","image communication","discrete cosine transform","trellis quantization","LDPC codes"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4313090","abstract":"We analyze duality in code design between encryption and data hiding problems.

We assume that each transmitter is cognizant of the message it wishes to convey to its corresponding receiver and also of the messages that a subset of the other transmitters wish to send. The receivers are assumed not to be able to cooperate in any way so that they must base their decision on the signal they receive only. We focus on the network's pre-log, which is defined as the limiting ratio of the sum-rate capacity to half the logarithm of the transmitted power. We present both upper and lower bounds on the network's pre-log. The lower bounds are based on a linear partial-cancellation scheme which entails linearly transforming Gaussian codebooks so as to eliminate the interference in a subset of the receivers. Inter alias, the bounds give a complete characterization of the networks and side-information settings that result in a full prelog, i.e., in a pre-log that is equal to the number of transmitters (and receivers) as well as a complete characterization of networks whose pre-log is equal to the full pre-log minus one. They also fully characterize networks where the full pre-log can only be achieved if each transmitter knows the messages of all users, i.e., when the side-information is \"full\".","doi":"10.1109/ITW.2007.4313095","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ITW.2007.4313095","startPage":"325","endPage":"330","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Information Theory Workshop","pdfPath":"/iel5/4313033/4313034/04313095.pdf","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Information Theory Workshop","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4313034","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On Cognitive Interference Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"2-6 Sept. 2007","displayDocTitle":"On Cognitive Interference Networks","conferenceDate":"2-6 Sept. 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"24 September 2007","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4313095/","accessionNumber":"9827086","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4313095/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On Cognitive Interference Networks","confLoc":"Tahoe City, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"ITW-00-61.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064495S","chronDate":"2-6 Sept. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4313033","isNumber":"4313034","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4313033","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"4313034","articleId":"4313095","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":4313096,"authors":[{"name":"Brian Smith","affiliation":["Department of ECE, University of Texas, Austin, Austin, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Brian","lastName":"Smith","id":"37380831100"},{"name":"Sriram Vishwanath","affiliation":["Department of ECE, University of Texas, Austin, Austin, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Sriram","lastName":"Vishwanath","id":"37283401100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-1563-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-1564-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4313096","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":18,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":107},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Unicast","Broadcasting","Interference constraints","Network coding","Lakes","Information theory","Upper bound","Wireless networks","Transmitters","Routing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["graph theory","interference (signal)","multi-access systems","radio receivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["unicast transmission","multiple access erasure networks","receiver interference","multiple-access channels","acyclic graph model","max-flow min-cut bound","interference properties","random coding","erasure locations","destination node","wireless erasure networks"]}],"abstract":"This paper determines the unicast capacity of a class of erasure networks which incorporate receiver interference. The networks under consideration are conglomerations of multiple-access channels: Each node has a single receiver, which obtains the finite-field sum of all the unerased inputs to that node. In this directed, acyclic graph model, nodes are allowed to transmit different symbols down each outgoing edge, in contrast to the broadcast constraint of the wireless erasure network of (Dana, 2006). This paper proves that a max-flow min-cut bound, which incorporates the interference properties of the model, is achievable using random coding arguments when knowledge of all erasure locations is provided to the destination node. In addition, the paper concludes by showing a duality relationship between multiple access erasure networks and wireless erasure networks.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Unicast Transmission Over Multiple Access Erasure Networks: Capacity and Duality","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Information Theory Workshop","doi":"10.1109/ITW.2007.4313096","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Information Theory Workshop","pdfPath":"/iel5/4313033/4313034/04313096.pdf","startPage":"331","endPage":"336","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ITW.2007.4313096","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4313034","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4313096","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4313096/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-6 Sept. 2007","displayDocTitle":"Unicast Transmission Over Multiple Access Erasure Networks: Capacity and Duality","conferenceDate":"2-6 Sept. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4313096/","dateOfInsertion":"24 September 2007","publicationDate":"Sept. 2007","accessionNumber":"9871758","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Unicast Transmission Over Multiple Access Erasure Networks: Capacity and Duality","confLoc":"Tahoe City, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"ITW-00-62.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050218S","chronDate":"2-6 Sept. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4313033","isNumber":"4313034","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4313033","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"4313034","articleId":"4313096","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4313097,"authors":[{"name":"Ruoheng Liu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Princeton University, Princeton, NJ, USA"],"firstName":"Ruoheng","lastName":"Liu","id":"37401291300"},{"name":"Yingbin Liang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Princeton University, Princeton, NJ, USA"],"firstName":"Yingbin","lastName":"Liang","id":"37275171000"},{"name":"H.

The nesting is based on cosets of a good code sequence for the first scheme and on cosets of the dual of a good code sequence for the second scheme. In each case, the corresponding achievable rate-equivocation pair is derived based on the threshold behavior of good code sequences. The two secure coding schemes together establish an achievable rate-equivocation region, which almost covers the secrecy capacity-equivocation region in this case study.

The output of these parallel channels is then fed to a standard SISO (single-input, single-output) decoder. Surprisingly, the diversity-multiplexing tradeoff (DMT) of this simple scheme has not been fully characterized before. We provide such characterization in this work, where we show that both linear zero-forcing (ZF) and linear minimum mean-square error (MMSE) receivers achieve the same DMT, which is equal to that of *one* of the parallel channels, even though coding and decoding is performed across the antennas. Hence, linear receivers incur a dramatic loss of diversity gain with respect to other non-linear schemes. Furthermore, we comment on the different behavior of the MMSE and ZF receivers at finite rate (zero multiplexing gain).","doi":"10.1109/ITW.2007.4313123","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Information Theory Workshop","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Information Theory Workshop","pdfPath":"/iel5/4313033/4313034/04313123.pdf","startPage":"487","endPage":"492","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ITW.2007.4313123","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4313034","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The Diversity-Multiplexing Tradeoff of Linear MIMO Receivers","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4313123","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-6 Sept. 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4313123/","displayDocTitle":"The Diversity-Multiplexing Tradeoff of Linear MIMO Receivers","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2007","accessionNumber":"9827108","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4313123/","conferenceDate":"2-6 Sept. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"24 September 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Diversity-Multiplexing Tradeoff of Linear MIMO Receivers","confLoc":"Tahoe City, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"ITW-00-89.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059639S","chronDate":"2-6 Sept. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4313033","isNumber":"4313034","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4313033","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"4313034","articleId":"4313123","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4313125,"authors":[{"name":"Satish Vedantam","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Southern California"],"firstName":"Satish","lastName":"Vedantam","id":"37266626000"},{"name":"Wenyi Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Southern California"],"firstName":"Wenyi","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37278431000"},{"name":"Urbashi Mitra","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Southern California"],"firstName":"Urbashi","lastName":"Mitra","id":"37269542000"},{"name":"Ashutosh Sabharwal","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Rice University"],"firstName":"Ashutosh","lastName":"Sabharwal","id":"37270204100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-1563-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-1564-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4313125","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":101},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4313125","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Channel estimation","Data communication","Rate distortion theory","Parameter estimation","Protocols","Fading","Additive noise","Gaussian noise","Performance gain","Reliability theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["AWGN channels","channel capacity","channel estimation","correlation methods","distortion","fading channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","data transmission","simultaneous communication","noisy channel","binary symmetric channel","achievable capacity-distortion tradeoff","joint protocols","time-orthogonal protocols","flat fading channel","additive white Gaussian noise channel","joint communication and estimation scheme","correlation sequences"]}],"abstract":"A formulation for a joint communication and estimation problem is proposed: simultaneous communication over a noisy channel and estimation of certain channel parameters are desired. We are interested in quantifying the tradeoff between the achievable rate and distortion in estimating the channel parameters. Two particular sample channels are considered and achievable rates for these channels are determined. First, the binary symmetric channel is examined; an achievable capacity-distortion tradeoff is derived for both joint and time-orthogonal protocols. For the flat fading, additive, white, Gaussian noise channel, a novel joint communication and estimation scheme using low correlation sequences is presented. It is observed that in most situations, joint communication and estimation performs better than a scheme where communication and estimation are performed individually, furthermore, the gains of joint communication and estimation over individual communication and estimation can be significant as the distortion tolerance increases. Finally, it is observed that even a slight tolerance to errors in the channel parameters close to the theoretical lower bounds yield significant improvements in the rate at which reliable communication is achievable.","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Information Theory Workshop","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Information Theory Workshop","pdfPath":"/iel5/4313033/4313034/04313125.pdf","startPage":"499","endPage":"504","doi":"10.1109/ITW.2007.4313125","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ITW.2007.4313125","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4313034","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint Channel Estimation and Data Transmission: Achievable Rates","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4313125/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-6 Sept. 2007","displayDocTitle":"Joint Channel Estimation and Data Transmission: Achievable Rates","htmlLink":"/document/4313125/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"24 September 2007","accessionNumber":"9827110","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"2-6 Sept. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint Channel Estimation and Data Transmission: Achievable Rates","confLoc":"Tahoe City, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"ITW-00-91.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.09008S","chronDate":"2-6 Sept. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4313033","isNumber":"4313034","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4313033","xplore-issue":"4313034","articleId":"4313125","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4313126,"authors":[{"name":"Daniela Tuninetti","affiliation":["ECE, UIC (University of Illinois at Chicago), USA"],"firstName":"Daniela","lastName":"Tuninetti","id":"37284288200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-1563-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-1564-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4313126","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":16,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":111},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4313126","abstract":"In this paper, we study the throughput performance of repetition protocols over block fading channels.

However, in several situations, such as CDMA, multiple-input multiple- output channels, OFDM, and intersymbol-interference channels, the channel itself either contains inherent signal redundancy or such redundancy can readily be introduced at the transmitter, for example, the direct-spread signature sequences of CDMA form inherent repetition codes. For such systems, iterative demodulation of the linear channel exploiting this redundancy using simple iterative cancellation demodulators, followed by conventional feed-forward error control decoding provides a low-complexity, but extremely efficient decoding alternative. It is shown that this two-stage demodulator/decoder, which outperforms more complex turbo CDMA methods for equal power modes (users), can support an arbitrary number of modes if an unequal power distribution is adopted, and that the capacity of the Gaussian multiple access channel can be approached to at least within less than one bit everywhere.","doi":"10.1109/ITW.2007.4313139","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Information Theory Workshop","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Information Theory Workshop","pdfPath":"/iel5/4313033/4313034/04313139.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ITW.2007.4313139","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4313034","startPage":"584","endPage":"589","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Low-Complexity Capacity Achieving Two-Stage Demodulation/Decoding for Random Matrix Channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4313139","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Low-Complexity Capacity Achieving Two-Stage Demodulation/Decoding for Random Matrix Channels","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-6 Sept. 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4313139/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"2-6 Sept. 2007","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2007","accessionNumber":"9827122","dateOfInsertion":"24 September 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4313139/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low-Complexity Capacity Achieving Two-Stage Demodulation/Decoding for Random Matrix Channels","confLoc":"Tahoe City, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"ITW-00-105.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053387S","chronDate":"2-6 Sept. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4313033","isNumber":"4313034","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4313033","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"4313034","articleId":"4313139","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4313140,"authors":[{"name":"S.

This paper develops a new approach to coherent decoding where channel state information is used to select from a plurality of zero-forcing decoders. The selection is made to maximize effective signal to noise ratio and the underlying Diophantine geometry guarantees that at least one of the available choices is good. The approach is described in detail for the important special case of the Golden code but it applies to a larger class of space-time codes where it provides a means of avoiding the uncertainties and implementation complexity associated with sphere decoding. In particular it extends battery life at the mobile terminal by eliminating the need for a second receive antenna. Simulation results for the Golden Code show performance within 2 dB of full maximum-likelihood decoding with worst case complexity that is quadratic in the size of the QAM signal constellation.","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4313140/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-6 Sept. 2007","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"2-6 Sept. 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4313140/","dateOfInsertion":"24 September 2007","publicationDate":"Sept. 2007","accessionNumber":"9827123","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Fast Decoding of the Golden Code by Diophantine Approximation","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fast Decoding of the Golden Code by Diophantine Approximation","confLoc":"Tahoe City, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"ITW-00-106.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043168S","chronDate":"2-6 Sept. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4313033","isNumber":"4313034","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4313033","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"4313034","articleId":"4313140","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4313141,"authors":[{"name":"Melda Yuksel","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Polytechnic University, Brooklyn, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Melda","lastName":"Yuksel","id":"37271624600"},{"name":"Elza Erkip","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Polytechnic University, Brooklyn, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Elza","lastName":"Erkip","id":"37266656500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-1563-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-1564-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4313141","dbTime":"20 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":49,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":427},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Relays","Demodulation","Multiaccess communication","Error correction","Iterative decoding","Redundancy","Interference cancellation","OFDM","MIMO","Equations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel coding","Gaussian channels","relays","telecommunication security"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["secure communication","wire-tapper","four terminal Gaussian network","source-destination pair","relay channel","direct transmission relaying schemes","amplify-and-forward relaying schemes","decode-and-forward relaying schemes","compress-and-forward relaying schemes","relaying protocols","power allocation schemes","source-destination communication"]}],"abstract":"A four terminal Gaussian network, composed of a single source-destination pair, a relay and a wire-tapper is considered.

However, since the destination is also allowed to listen to the relay's transmission, it also benefits from the relay in terms of achievable rates. Direct transmission, amplify-and-forward (AF), decode-and-forward (DF) and compress-and-forward (CF) relaying schemes are compared in terms of secrecy rates.

Three different scenarios are considered: relay-source, destination-relay, and destination-source feedback. It is found that even with just one bit of CSF from the relay to control the source power is sufficient to achieve the multiantenna upperbound in a range of multiplexing gain, with fixed-length codes, i.e., with coding schemes significantly simpler than \"dynamic decode-and-forward.\" CSF from destination to control the relay power slightly outperforms dynamic decode- and-forward at high multiplexing gains. CSF from destination when the source-relay channel gain is unknown to the destination, achieves a diversity exponent equal to K times the diversity exponent of dynamic decode and forward, for any multiplexing gain. This linear growth of diversity with the number of feedback levels stands in sharp contrast to the exponential growth for multiantenna channels (fully cooperative transmitters).","pdfPath":"/iel5/4313033/4313034/04313146.pdf","startPage":"620","endPage":"625","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Information Theory Workshop","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4313034","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ITW.2007.4313146","doi":"10.1109/ITW.2007.4313146","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Information Theory Workshop","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4313146","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fading","Relays","Channel state information","Power system relaying","Decoding","Power control","Performance gain","State feedback","Transmitters","Resource management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","fading channels","transmitters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fading relay channels","partial channel state information","optimal dimension","power allocation","quantized channel state feedback","relay source","destination relay","destination source feedback","multiantenna upperbound","multiantenna channels","cooperative transmitters"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-6 Sept. 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4313146/","displayDocTitle":"On the Outage Exponent of Fading Relay Channels with Partial Channel State Information","accessionNumber":"9827129","dateOfInsertion":"24 September 2007","publicationDate":"Sept. 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4313146/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"2-6 Sept. 2007","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the Outage Exponent of Fading Relay Channels with Partial Channel State Information","confLoc":"Tahoe City, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"ITW-00-112.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.082554S","chronDate":"2-6 Sept. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4313033","isNumber":"4313034","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4313033","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4313034","articleId":"4313146","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4313147,"authors":[{"name":"Ghassan M.

Simulation results for Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) of the received image at different rates are presented which demonstrate the contribution of our algorithm over this challenging channel.","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Pacific Rim Conference on Communications, Computers and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4313155/4313156/04313178.pdf","startPage":"66","endPage":"69","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Pacific Rim Conference on Communications, Computers and Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/PACRIM.2007.4313178","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PACRIM.2007.4313178","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4313156","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4313178","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robust Wireless Image Communications Using Combined SPIHT/OFDM Technique","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Robustness","Wireless communication","Image communication","OFDM","Image coding","Fading","PSNR","Communication system control","Control systems","Adaptive systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image coding","OFDM modulation","Rayleigh channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["robust wireless image communications","combined SPIHT/OFDM technique","image/video transmission","image coding scheme","adaptive modulation OFDM system","communication coding scheme","uncorrelated Rayleigh fading channel","peak signal-to-noise ratio","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4313178/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 Aug. 2007","displayDocTitle":"Robust Wireless Image Communications Using Combined SPIHT/OFDM Technique","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4313178/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2007","accessionNumber":"9789891","dateOfInsertion":"24 September 2007","conferenceDate":"22-24 Aug. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust Wireless Image Communications Using Combined SPIHT/OFDM Technique","confLoc":"Victoria, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"PACRIM-00-22.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063005S","chronDate":"22-24 Aug. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4313155","isNumber":"4313156","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4313155","xplore-issue":"4313156","articleId":"4313178","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4313185,"authors":[{"name":"Rasit Tutgun","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Hacettepe University, Ankara, Turkey"],"firstName":"Rasit","lastName":"Tutgun","id":"37061578300"},{"name":"Emre Aktas","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Hacettepe University, Ankara, Turkey"],"firstName":"Emre","lastName":"Aktas","id":"37275339000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-1190-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1189-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1190-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1555-5798"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2154-5952"}],"articleNumber":"4313185","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":32},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multiaccess communication","Telecommunication traffic","Fading","Error analysis","Channel estimation","Interference","Channel capacity","Multiuser detection","Upper bound","Signal design"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel capacity","channel estimation","code division multiple access","fading channels","mean square error methods","telecommunication traffic","time division multiplexing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["pilot-assisted CDMA system","code-division multiple access","time-multiplexed pilot symbols","sum-capacity","optimal pilot-to-data symbol rates","spreading gain","traffic load","MMSE channel estimation","fading channels"]}],"abstract":"The uplink of a pilot-assisted code-division multiple access system is considered where the pilot symbols are time-multiplexed with the data symbols.

However, base station requires a large amount of feedback information of channel state information (CSI) in the adaptive channel. In order to reduce the overload of CSI feedback, we propose a feedback scheme which only selects the users scheduled in the next time slot to feed back the channel information according to user mobility. We use adaptive modulation to apply bit rate adaptation depending on user channel condition, where the scheduling time is fixed. By fixing the packet size, scheduling time and feedback period can be fit to different time slots according to user transmission rate. We demonstrate by computer simulation that the proposed scheme can reduce the overload of user feedback with the minimum suppression of the throughput degradation.","doi":"10.1109/PACRIM.2007.4313200","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Pacific Rim Conference on Communications, Computers and Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Pacific Rim Conference on Communications, Computers and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4313155/4313156/04313200.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PACRIM.2007.4313200","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4313156","startPage":"153","endPage":"156","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reduction of Feedback Overload by Exploiting Adaptive Channel in OFDMA systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4313200","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Reduction of Feedback Overload by Exploiting Adaptive Channel in OFDMA systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 Aug. 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4313200/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"22-24 Aug. 2007","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2007","accessionNumber":"9789913","dateOfInsertion":"24 September 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4313200/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reduction of Feedback Overload by Exploiting Adaptive Channel in OFDMA systems","confLoc":"Victoria, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"PACRIM-00-44.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050331S","chronDate":"22-24 Aug. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4313155","isNumber":"4313156","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4313155","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4313156","articleId":"4313200","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":4313201,"authors":[{"name":"Hamed Saghaei","affiliation":["Shahr_e_Rey Branch, Islamic Azad University, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Hamed","lastName":"Saghaei","id":"37589791600"},{"name":"Abbas Ali Lotfi Neyestanak","affiliation":["Shahr_e_Rey Branch, Islamic Azad University, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Abbas Ali Lotfi","lastName":"Neyestanak","id":"37319054400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-1190-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1189-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1190-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1555-5798"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2154-5952"}],"articleNumber":"4313201","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":93},"abstract":"The power control has been widely studied and shown to be crucial for the capacity and performance of direct-sequence code-division multiple-access (DS-CDMA) systems. Practical implementations typically employ fast closed-loop power control, where transmitters adjust their transmit powers according to commands received in a feedback channel. The loop delay resulting from the measurements, processing, and transmission of the power control commands can result in oscillations of the transmission powers and lead to degradation in the system performance. In this paper we present new variable step closed-loop power control algorithm (VSPC) and fixed-step closed loop power control with information feedback (FSPC-IF), that are able to increase speed of convergence and alleviate the effect of the loop delay. We carried out computational experiments on a DS-CDMA network using these algorithms. Fixed-step power control with decision feedback (FSPC-DF) is reference algorithm. New algorithms are compared with it. The numerical results indicate that new algorithms can significantly improve the radio network capacity without any increase in power control signaling, also increase speed of convergence and decrease loop delay.","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Pacific Rim Conference on Communications, Computers and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4313155/4313156/04313201.pdf","startPage":"157","endPage":"160","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Pacific Rim Conference on Communications, Computers and Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/PACRIM.2007.4313201","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PACRIM.2007.4313201","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4313156","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4313201","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Variable Step Closed-Loop Power Control in Cellular Wireless CDMA Systems under Multipath Fading","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power control","Multiaccess communication","Fading","Radio transmitters","Delay","Power measurement","Degradation","System performance","Feedback loop","Convergence"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["automatic repeat request","cellular radio","closed loop systems","code division multiple access","convergence of numerical methods","fading channels","multipath channels","power control","spread spectrum communication","telecommunication control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular wireless CDMA system","direct-sequence code-division multiple-access system","DS-CDMA network","multipath fading","feedback channel","transmission power oscillation","variable step closed-loop power control","VSPC algorithm","fixed-step closed loop power control","information feedback","FSPC-IF","decision feedback","radio network capacity","convergence"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4313201/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 Aug. 2007","displayDocTitle":"Variable Step Closed-Loop Power Control in Cellular Wireless CDMA Systems under Multipath Fading","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4313201/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2007","accessionNumber":"9789914","dateOfInsertion":"24 September 2007","conferenceDate":"22-24 Aug. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Variable Step Closed-Loop Power Control in Cellular Wireless CDMA Systems under Multipath Fading","confLoc":"Victoria, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"PACRIM-00-45.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046841S","chronDate":"22-24 Aug. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4313155","isNumber":"4313156","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4313155","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"4313156","articleId":"4313201","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4313202,"authors":[{"name":"Yousry Abdel-Hamid","affiliation":["Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering, University of Victoria, Victoria, BC, Canada"],"firstName":"Yousry","lastName":"Abdel-Hamid","id":"38556319300"},{"name":"Fayez Gebali","affiliation":["Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering, University of Victoria, Victoria, BC, Canada"],"firstName":"Fayez","lastName":"Gebali","id":"37269473000"},{"name":"T.

However, the so many multi-code signals are summed in the time domain so that it suffers from the serious problem of high peak to average power ratio (PAPR). Therefore, the expensive linear amplifier or large input back-off is necessary to overcome the problem but it makes power consumption of high power amplifier (HPA) very poor. In this paper, we propose a new method that can reduce PAPR efficiently by constraint codes based on the opposite correlation property of the incoming information data. PAPR reduction performance depends on the length and indices of constraint codes in the MC-CDMA system. There is a trade-off between PAPR reduction and the length of constraint codes. We also study the BER improvement in AWGN channel. The simulation results show that BER performance can be very close to the linear amplifier in two cases: 1) when the exact constraint codes are used without input back-off and 2) when a few constraint codes are used with small input back-off.","doi":"10.1109/PACRIM.2007.4313233","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Pacific Rim Conference on Communications, Computers and Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Pacific Rim Conference on Communications, Computers and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4313155/4313156/04313233.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PACRIM.2007.4313233","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4313156","startPage":"296","endPage":"299","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A PAPR Reduction Method using Constraint Code in Multicode CDMA System","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4313233","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A PAPR Reduction Method using Constraint Code in Multicode CDMA System","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 Aug. 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4313233/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"22-24 Aug. 2007","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2007","accessionNumber":"9789946","dateOfInsertion":"24 September 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4313233/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A PAPR Reduction Method using Constraint Code in Multicode CDMA System","confLoc":"Victoria, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"PACRIM-00-77.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054143S","chronDate":"22-24 Aug. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4313155","isNumber":"4313156","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4313155","xplore-issue":"4313156","articleId":"4313233","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4313234,"authors":[{"name":"Heung-Gyoon Ryu","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Chungbuk National University, Cheonghu, Chungcheongbuk, South Korea"],"firstName":"Heung-Gyoon","lastName":"Ryu","id":"37278285300"},{"name":"Seon-Ae Kim","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Chungbuk National University, Cheonghu, Chungcheongbuk, South Korea"],"firstName":"Seon-Ae","lastName":"Kim","id":"37715231900"},{"name":"Cheng-Xiang Wang","affiliation":["JRI in SIP, School of EPS, Heriot-Watt University, Edinburgh, UK"],"firstName":"Cheng-Xiang","lastName":"Wang","id":"37292500000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-1190-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1189-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1190-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1555-5798"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2154-5952"}],"articleNumber":"4313234","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":148},"abstract":"Partial transmit sequence (PTS) scheme has been widely studied to reduce the peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) of Orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) signal since it is flexible and any spectral regrowth is not made. A necessity of the PTS scheme is to transmit the side information about the phase rotation factors for correct OFDM symbol recovery. In this paper, a new side information embedded PTS scheme using the reference symbols is proposed for the PAPR reduction and the BER performance is analyzed when the erroneous side information is received. In this proposed method, the information about the rotation factors is expressed by the phase of reference symbols. The proposed method maintains the same PAPR reduction performance as the conventional PTS scheme and OFDM symbols are correctly recovered by the side information to meet the required BER level. Also, the proposed method can be easily realized for all kinds of digital modulation formats in the OFDM communication system.","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Pacific Rim Conference on Communications, Computers and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4313155/4313156/04313234.pdf","startPage":"300","endPage":"303","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Pacific Rim Conference on Communications, Computers and Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/PACRIM.2007.4313234","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PACRIM.2007.4313234","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4313156","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4313234","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Side Information Embedded PTS Scheme in the OFDM Communication System","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Peak to average power ratio","Partial transmit sequences","OFDM modulation","Bit error rate","Bandwidth","Degradation","Nonlinear distortion","Power engineering and energy","Frequency division multiplexing","Information analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["error statistics","OFDM modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["side information embedded PTS scheme","OFDM communication system","partial transmit sequence","peak-to-average power ratio","orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing","phase rotation factors","symbol recovery","reference symbols","BER performance"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["OFDM","PTS","PAPR","phase rotation","side information","nonlinearity","bandwidth efficiency"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4313234/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 Aug. 2007","displayDocTitle":"A Side Information Embedded PTS Scheme in the OFDM Communication System","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4313234/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2007","accessionNumber":"9789947","dateOfInsertion":"24 September 2007","conferenceDate":"22-24 Aug. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Side Information Embedded PTS Scheme in the OFDM Communication System","confLoc":"Victoria, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"PACRIM-00-78.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.037347S","chronDate":"22-24 Aug. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4313155","isNumber":"4313156","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4313155","xplore-issue":"4313156","articleId":"4313234","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4313235,"authors":[{"name":"Abolfazl Ghassemi","affiliation":["Student Member, IEEE"],"firstName":"Abolfazl","lastName":"Ghassemi","id":"38363252000"},{"name":"T.

Meanwhile, the single-carrier transmission with frequency domain equalization (SC-FDE) is also attracting much attention. It is reported that the SC-FDE system obtains an excellent performance as well as orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM), because the SC-FDE system has the advantage of frequency diversity gain even in strong frequency selective channels. However, in the SC-FDE system, cyclic extension reduces the bandwidth efficiency. To improve the bandwidth efficiency, we proposed UWB-IR and DS-UWB with Frequency-Domain Equalization (FDE) and Cyclic Prefix (CP) reconstruction, and showed that when the channel estimation is ideal, the proposed system achieves the good performance. Both FDE and CP reconstruction use channel gains and thus the performance is expected to depend largely on the channel estimation accuracy. In this paper, we evaluate the effect of imperfect channel estimation on the performance of UWB-IR with MMSE-FDE and CP Reconstruction. We show that CP reconstruction is effective for UWB-IR with MMSE-FDE in the IEEE UWB multipath channels, CM3, CM4.","doi":"10.1109/PACRIM.2007.4313244","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4313156","startPage":"342","endPage":"345","pdfPath":"/iel5/4313155/4313156/04313244.pdf","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Pacific Rim Conference on Communications, Computers and Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Pacific Rim Conference on Communications, Computers and Signal Processing","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PACRIM.2007.4313244","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Effect of Imperfect Channel Estimation on the Performance of UWB-IR with Frequency-Domain Equalization (FDE) and Cyclic Prefix (CP) Reconstruction","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Channel estimation","Multipath channels","Bandwidth","OFDM","Performance gain","Frequency diversity","Bit error rate","Ultra wideband technology","Wireless communication","Frequency domain analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","equalisers","least mean squares methods","multipath channels","OFDM modulation","ultra wideband communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["imperfect channel estimation","ultra wideband system","frequency-domain equalization","cyclic prefix reconstruction","wireless communication","single-carrier transmission","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","frequency diversity gain","frequency selective channel","UWB-IR performance","MMSE-FDE","IEEE UWB multipath channel"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 Aug. 2007","displayDocTitle":"Effect of Imperfect Channel Estimation on the Performance of UWB-IR with Frequency-Domain Equalization (FDE) and Cyclic Prefix (CP) Reconstruction","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4313244/","dateOfInsertion":"24 September 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4313244/","accessionNumber":"9789957","publicationDate":"Aug. 2007","conferenceDate":"22-24 Aug. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Effect of Imperfect Channel Estimation on the Performance of UWB-IR with Frequency-Domain Equalization (FDE) and Cyclic Prefix (CP) Reconstruction","confLoc":"Victoria, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"PACRIM-00-88.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.040756S","chronDate":"22-24 Aug. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4313155","isNumber":"4313156","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4313155","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4313156","articleId":"4313244","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4313247,"authors":[{"name":"Darshika G.

This platform has been implemented by extending the CoDeL design suite. CoDeL allows hardware description at the algorithm level, and thus dramatically reduces design time. Also, it automatically inserts clock gating at the behavioral level to reduce dynamic power dissipation in the resulting architecture. This is, to our knowledge, the first hardware design environment that allows an algorithmic description of a component and yet produces a power aware design. We use the DSPstone benchmark to thoroughly evaluate this fixed point design platform for the design of power efficient DSP architectures. We find that, compared to a modern DSP, the CoDeL platform produces designs with somewhat slower run times but dramatically lower power dissipation. Next we use power analysis to compare the effectiveness of CoDeL's automated clock gating as compared to automated clock gating using synopsys tools. A simulation based power analysis shows that CoDeL's clock gating provides 16% more power savings than Synopsys' automated clock gating alone.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PACRIM.2007.4313248","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4313156","startPage":"359","endPage":"362","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Pacific Rim Conference on Communications, Computers and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4313155/4313156/04313248.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High Level Fixed Point VLSI Design with Automated Clock Gating","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4313248/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 Aug. 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4313248/","displayDocTitle":"High Level Fixed Point VLSI Design with Automated Clock Gating","conferenceDate":"22-24 Aug. 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2007","accessionNumber":"9789961","dateOfInsertion":"24 September 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High Level Fixed Point VLSI Design with Automated Clock Gating","confLoc":"Victoria, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"PACRIM-00-92.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06056S","chronDate":"22-24 Aug. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4313155","isNumber":"4313156","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4313155","xplore-issue":"4313156","articleId":"4313248","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4313264,"authors":[{"name":"Yakup K.

Majority of the previous work on this problem assumed a total power constraint on the base stations. However, since each transmit antenna is limited by the amount of power it can transmit due to the limited linear region of the power amplifiers, a more realistic constraint is to place a limit on the per antenna power. Yu and Lan proposed an iterative algorithm for computing the optimum beamforming vectors minimizing the power margin over all antennas under individual SINR and per antenna power constraints. However, from a system designer point of view, it may be more desirable to minimize the total transmit power rather than minimizing the power margin, especially when the system is not symmetric. Reformulating the transmitter optimization problem to minimize the total transmit power subject to individual SINR constraints on the users and per antenna power constraints on the base stations, the algorithm proposed by Yu and Lan is modified. Performance of the modified algorithm is compared with existing methods for various cellular array scenarios.","doi":"10.1109/PACRIM.2007.4313264","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Pacific Rim Conference on Communications, Computers and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4313155/4313156/04313264.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4313156","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PACRIM.2007.4313264","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Pacific Rim Conference on Communications, Computers and Signal Processing","startPage":"422","endPage":"425","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Downlink Beamforming Under Individual SINR and Per Antenna Power Constraints","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4313264","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 Aug. 2007","displayDocTitle":"Downlink Beamforming Under Individual SINR and Per Antenna Power Constraints","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4313264/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4313264/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2007","accessionNumber":"9789977","dateOfInsertion":"24 September 2007","conferenceDate":"22-24 Aug. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Downlink Beamforming Under Individual SINR and Per Antenna Power Constraints","confLoc":"Victoria, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"PACRIM-00-108.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.074556S","chronDate":"22-24 Aug. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4313155","isNumber":"4313156","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4313155","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"4313156","articleId":"4313264","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4313268,"authors":[{"name":"Sunitha Kopparthi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering, Kansas State University, Manhattan, KS, USA"],"firstName":"Sunitha","lastName":"Kopparthi","id":"37277549800"},{"name":"Don M.

If the channel varies within the time duration of an OFDM symbol, intercarrier interference (ICI) creates, resulting in a degradation of the error performance. Minimum mean square error decision feedback estimation (MMSE-DFE) algorithms can combat ICI. A standard MMSE symbol detection requires a calculation of the inverse of the signal covariance matrix which has a high computational cost. For this reason, alternative MMSE techniques have been developed which use recursive calculations and decision feedback to compute symbol estimates at a low computational cost with minimal increases in error performance. However, these computations are ill-conditioned and their error performance degrades when low precision arithmetic is used. This paper proposes a new iterative MMSE-DFE algorithm with the use of Cholesky updates. This method is more stable than other iterative MMSE-DFE algorithms. Simulation results show that the method improves the performance with no increase in computational complexity.","doi":"10.1109/PACRIM.2007.4313288","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Pacific Rim Conference on Communications, Computers and Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Pacific Rim Conference on Communications, Computers and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4313155/4313156/04313288.pdf","startPage":"522","endPage":"525","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PACRIM.2007.4313288","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4313156","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Iterative Decision Feedback Algorithm using the Cholesky Update for OFDM with Fast Fading","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4313288","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 Aug. 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4313288/","displayDocTitle":"An Iterative Decision Feedback Algorithm using the Cholesky Update for OFDM with Fast Fading","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2007","accessionNumber":"9790000","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4313288/","conferenceDate":"22-24 Aug. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"24 September 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Iterative Decision Feedback Algorithm using the Cholesky Update for OFDM with Fast Fading","confLoc":"Victoria, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"PACRIM-00-132.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.082559S","chronDate":"22-24 Aug. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4313155","isNumber":"4313156","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4313155","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4313156","articleId":"4313288","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4313289,"authors":[{"name":"Yonghong Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada"],"firstName":"Yonghong","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37292465700"},{"name":"Cyril Leung","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada"],"firstName":"Cyril","lastName":"Leung","id":"37279072600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-1190-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1189-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1190-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1555-5798"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2154-5952"}],"articleNumber":"4313289","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":52},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Additive white noise","AWGN","Gaussian noise","Signal to noise ratio","Noise level","Bit rate","Fading","Downlink","Power system modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiuser channels","OFDM modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["equal power subchannel loading","multiuser OFDM systems","optimal water-filling subchannel power loading scheme","subchannel signal-to-noise ratio"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Power allocation","multiuser OFDM","OFDMA","water-filling"]}],"abstract":"The difference in total subchannel bits loaded between the optimal water-filling subchannel power loading scheme and a simple equal power subchannel loading scheme for a multiuser OFDM system is studied.

To reduce the computational complexity associated with the groupwise recursive channel estimation schemes, we propose an inverse QR decomposition (IQR) algorithm based on scaled Givens rotations. The performance of the proposed algorithms is evaluated via simulations and compared to the case with perfect channel state information (CSI) knowledge at the receiver. The simulations show that the proposed algorithms perform reasonably close to the perfect CSI case under various channel conditions.","doi":"10.1109/PACRIM.2007.4313307","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Pacific Rim Conference on Communications, Computers and Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Pacific Rim Conference on Communications, Computers and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4313155/4313156/04313307.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PACRIM.2007.4313307","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4313156","startPage":"597","endPage":"600","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Groupwise Recursive Channel Estimation for Space-Frequency Block Coded OFDM Systems in Doubly Selective Fading Channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4313307","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Groupwise Recursive Channel Estimation for Space-Frequency Block Coded OFDM Systems in Doubly Selective Fading Channels","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 Aug. 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4313307/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"22-24 Aug. 2007","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2007","accessionNumber":"9790019","dateOfInsertion":"24 September 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4313307/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Groupwise Recursive Channel Estimation for Space-Frequency Block Coded OFDM Systems in Doubly Selective Fading Channels","confLoc":"Victoria, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"PACRIM-00-151.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.077306S","chronDate":"22-24 Aug. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4313155","isNumber":"4313156","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4313155","xplore-issue":"4313156","articleId":"4313307","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4313308,"authors":[{"name":"Aditya Trivedi","affiliation":["Deptt. of Information Technology, ABV Indian Institute of Information technology and Management, Gwalior, India"],"firstName":"Aditya","lastName":"Trivedi","id":"37544703600"},{"name":"Rekha Gupta","affiliation":["Deptt of Electronics Engineeringg, Madhav Institute of Technology and Science, Gwalior, India"],"firstName":"Rekha","lastName":"Gupta","id":"37709991400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-1190-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1189-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1190-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1555-5798"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2154-5952"}],"articleNumber":"4313308","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":96},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Channel estimation","Multicarrier code division multiple access","Multiuser detection","Maximum likelihood estimation","Discrete Fourier transforms","Information technology","Bit error rate","OFDM","Frequency synchronization","Delay"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","code division multiple access","discrete Fourier transforms","maximum likelihood estimation","mean square error methods","multiuser detection","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["pilot symbol assisted channel estimation","uplink MC-CDMA system","MMSE receiver","multicarrier code division multiple access","multiuser detection","minimum mean-square error method","maximum likelihood estimation","inverse discrete Fourier transform","channel statistics"]}],"abstract":"In order to attain near-single user performance in uplink multicarrier code division multiple access (MC-CDMA) systems, multiuser detection (MUD) methods may be employed.

The basic block consists of a modified phase-lock loop with a search and reset circuit. The input high-frequency signal is sampled, the frequency of the sampled output is locked to a reference frequency of a few kc/s, and the output waveform is a sampled replica of the input waveform. Using such a loop, measurements of RF signals can be made easily by a constant low-frequency readout circuit. Synchronization is obtained automatically for any input frequency without the need of a separate trigger circuit. Limitations as well as applications of the sampling phase-lock loop are briefly discussed.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sampling methods","Instruments","Circuits","Signal design","Radio frequency","Distortion measurement","Phase measurement","Phase distortion","Amplitude modulation","RF signals"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TIM.1965.4313443","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement","pdfPath":"/iel5/19/4313430/04313443.pdf","startPage":"64","endPage":"68","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4313430","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIM.1965.4313443","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Phase-Locked Sampling Instruments","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4313443","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Phase-Locked Sampling Instruments","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4313443/","volume":"IM-14","issue":"1/2","publicationDate":"March-June 1965","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"March-June  1965","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March-June  1965","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Phase-Locked Sampling Instruments","sourcePdf":"TIM-v14-n1-13.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.034113S","chronDate":"March-June  1965","isNumber":"4313430","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"19","citationCount":"6","articleId":"4313443","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1965","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":4313555,"authors":[{"name":"Donald E.

It has an inherent phase resolution capability of greater than 0.001\u00b0, although the present design is limited by stability, noise, and spurious responses to an accuracy of about \u00b10.01\u00b0. The instrument utilizes the well-known technique of measuring phase in terms of the time between the zero crossings of two sinusoidal signals, using an electronic counter for time-measuring and display. A considerable advance in angular resolution, accuracy, and operational ease over any known previous instrumentation has been achieved by a painstaking combination of such key factors as highly level-insensitive zero-crossing detectors, extremely linear RF/IF amplifiers and mixers, and multiperiod averaging of the numerical readout. Verification of the hundredth-degree accuracy for all phase angles, operating levels, and frequencies is a problem comparable in magnitude to the development of the meter itself. For cases where the signal level is essentially constant, a relatively simple verification procedure is described. Verification of meter insensitivity to signal level changes requires the availability of a phase-calibrated RF attenuator.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4313526","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement","pdfPath":"/iel5/19/4313526/04313555.pdf","doi":"10.1109/TIM.1966.4313555","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIM.1966.4313555","startPage":"304","endPage":"310","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A 5 to 50 MHz Direct-Reading Phase Meter with Hundredth-Degree Precision","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1966","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1966","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4313555/","displayDocTitle":"A 5 to 50 MHz Direct-Reading Phase Meter with Hundredth-Degree Precision","isJournal":true,"volume":"15","issue":"4","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2007","publicationDate":"Dec. 1966","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A 5 to 50 MHz Direct-Reading Phase Meter with Hundredth-Degree Precision","sourcePdf":"TIM-v15-n4-29.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.04464S","chronDate":"Dec.  1966","isNumber":"4313526","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"19","citationCount":"7","articleId":"4313555","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1966","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4313680,"authors":[{"name":"Rolf E.

In general, the noise figure (or temperature) depends upon the generator impedance and is thus a function of the signal-source and amplifier combination. Typically, the noise figure is measured by the Y-factor method using hot and cold noise sources that are nominally matched (reflectionless). The result of this measurement is of value as a figure of merit; however, if optimum performance is to be realized, the applications engineer must know whether to adjust the signal source impedance for maximum power transfer, minimum noise figure, or some other criterion, and he must know the deterioration in performance that results if this is not done. It is the purpose of this paper to present an alternative method of characterizing amplifier noise performance in terms of parameters that provide ready answers to these questions. In addition, the measurement of these parameters via a simple extension of the Y-factor method will be described.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4313896","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIM.1970.4313925","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement","pdfPath":"/iel5/19/4313896/04313925.pdf","startPage":"344","endPage":"349","doi":"10.1109/TIM.1970.4313925","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A New Method of Characterizing Amplifier Noise Performance","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  1970","displayDocTitle":"A New Method of Characterizing Amplifier Noise Performance","volume":"19","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 1970","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4313925/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov.  1970","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A New Method of Characterizing Amplifier Noise Performance","sourcePdf":"TIM-v19-n4-29.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.03214S","chronDate":"Nov.  1970","isNumber":"4313896","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"19","citationCount":"29","articleId":"4313925","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1970","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4313932,"authors":[{"name":"A.

Schottky barrier diode and vacuum-tube multipliers were compared to the p-n junction devices. The tube doublers exhibited an anomaly, since their phase noise did not change with the application of negative feedback, indicating the possibility that the tubes themselves may be much better than the observed noise. The noise of the transistor doublers was progressively reduced by application of increasing amounts of negative feedback until a lower limit was reached. The noise then remained constant in spite of further increases in the amount of negative feedback. Measurements were obtained on all doublers from 2 Hz to 5 kHz with extrapolation to 1 Hz.

For this reason, a new random sampling time base unit was designed to perform these measurements at the low repetition rate of Hg switches. The time base may be used with commercial sampling oscilloscope systems through suitable interconnection terminals or possible interface equipment. It features three selectable time windows of 1 jus, 100 ns, and 10 ns. Using its time magnifier, the fastest sweep rate is 10 ps/cm. A variable trigger lead time control is provided.

Comparisons with stability measurements made on crystal controlled oscillators indicate that noise in the electronics of the oscillators very seriously degrades the inherent stability of the quartz resonators for times less than 1 s. A simple model appears to describe the noise mechanism in crystal controlled oscillators and points the way to design changes which should improve their short-term stability by two orders of magnitude. Calculations are outlined which show that with this improved short-term stability it should be feasible to multiply a crystal controlled source to 1 THz and obtain a linewidth of less than 1 Hz. In many cases, this improved short-term stability should also permit a factor of 100 reduction in the length of time necessary to achieve a given level of accuracy in frequency measurements.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Measurement of the Short-Term Stability of Quartz Crystal Resonators and the Implications for Crystal Oscillator Design and Applications","doi":"10.1109/TIM.1975.4314362","endPage":"20","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement","pdfPath":"/iel5/19/4314356/04314362.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement","startPage":"15","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIM.1975.4314362","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4314356","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4314362","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Oscillators","Circuit stability","Frequency measurement","Noise measurement","Circuit noise","Degradation","Crystals","Equivalent circuits","Passive circuits","Active noise reduction"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Measurement of the Short-Term Stability of Quartz Crystal Resonators and the Implications for Crystal Oscillator Design and Applications","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4314362/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1975","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1975","volume":"24","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 1975","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Measurement of the Short-Term Stability of Quartz Crystal Resonators and the Implications for Crystal Oscillator Design and Applications","sourcePdf":"TIM-v24-n1-6.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.076227S","chronDate":"March  1975","isNumber":"4314356","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"19","citationCount":"91","articleId":"4314362","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1975","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":4314364,"authors":[{"name":"Maria A.

A simplified theory is developed and shown to reproduce the experimental results for the relative power in the carrier and noise pedestal, and the shape and the width of the carrier and noise pedestal, to within the measurement uncertainty of 2 or 3 dB, from 5 MHz to 10 THz. The calculations are easily made using analytical techniques from the measurement of the spectral density of phase fluctuations of the source, the effective input spectrum density and the bandwidth of the multiplier chain, and the frequency multiplication factor. It is shown that present 5-MHz-crystal-controlled oscillators are useful as a precision source to ~500 GHz.

For reasons discussed in this paper, laboratory instruments such as capacitance bridges are not well-suited to this need. In order to test capacitor arrays accurately, a novel technique has been developed. It is based on a special algorithm in which the capacitor array is used as a precision voltage divider. A capacitor array tester consisting of both hardware and software has been built which executes this algorithm. This system has been used to perform measurements upon a large number (thousands) of NMOS and CMOS capacitor arrays. The standard deviation of this tester's measurement error is approximately 0.0009 percent of full scale (0.0088 LSB referenced to 10 bits). In contrast with manual testing with a capacitance bridge (requiring 10 min per array), the tester requires less than 5 s to fully test an array, mark the circuit and move to the next die position.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Capacitors","Measurement techniques","Circuit testing","Performance evaluation","Capacitance","Bridge circuits","Application specific integrated circuits","Integrated circuit testing","Laboratories","Instruments"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4314753","doi":"10.1109/TIM.1979.4314753","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement","pdfPath":"/iel5/19/4314746/04314753.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIM.1979.4314753","startPage":"11","endPage":"17","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4314746","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Precision Capacitor Ratio Measurement Technique for Integrated Circuit Capacitor Arrays","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Precision Capacitor Ratio Measurement Technique for Integrated Circuit Capacitor Arrays","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4314753/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1979","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1979","volume":"28","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2007","publicationDate":"March 1979","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Precision Capacitor Ratio Measurement Technique for Integrated Circuit Capacitor Arrays","sourcePdf":"TIM-v28-n1-7.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.047411S","chronDate":"March  1979","isNumber":"4314746","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"19","citationCount":"25","articleId":"4314753","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1979","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4314779,"authors":[{"name":"Vijay K.

Conventional digital correlators require fast and expensive analog-to-digital converters and digital multipliers. This paper describes the implementation of a fast, inexpensive, and unbiased correlation estimator. The estimator is based on the ternary Random Reference Correlation (RRC). Unbiasness is achieved by the addition of statistically independent, uniformly distributed auxiliary noise sources to the input signals. The use of a ternary quantizer eliminates the need of an A/D converter and multiplier, which are replaced by relatively simple logic circuits. A prototype system is described. Real-time correlations of signals, sampled at a rate of about 4 kHz, were achieved by the prototype system. Correlation errors were found to be in the range of one percent. Increasing the internal clock frequency and using faster logic components will improve system performance to perform real-time correlation calculations of signals sampled at 50 kHz.","doi":"10.1109/TIM.1983.4315102","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement","pdfPath":"/iel5/19/4315090/04315102.pdf","startPage":"438","endPage":"442","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIM.1983.4315102","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4315090","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4315102","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fast Correlation Estimation by a Random Reference Correlator","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  1983","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  1983","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4315102/","displayDocTitle":"Fast Correlation Estimation by a Random Reference Correlator","volume":"32","issue":"3","publicationDate":"Sept. 1983","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"22 October 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fast Correlation Estimation by a Random Reference Correlator","sourcePdf":"TIM-v32-n3-12.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.025405S","chronDate":"Sept.  1983","isNumber":"4315090","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"19","citationCount":"4","articleId":"4315102","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1983","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4315140,"authors":[{"name":"Anwar A.

The output is recorded and then a numerical deconvolution is often done to extract the impulse response of the object. Classically, the fast Fourier transform (FFT) technique has been applied with much success to the above deconvolution problem. However, when the signal-to-noise ratio becomes small, sometimes one encounters instability with the FFT approach. In this paper, the method of conjugate gradient is applied to the deconvolution problem. The problem is solved entirely in the time domain. The method converges for any initial guess in a finite number of steps. Also, for the application of the conjugate gradient method, the time samples need not be uniform, like FFT. Since, in this case, one is solving the operator equation directly, by passing the autocorrelation matrix computation, storage required is 5N as opposed to N2. Computed impulse response utilizing this technique has been presented for measured incident and scattered fields.","doi":"10.1109/TIM.1985.4315400","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement","startPage":"541","endPage":"546","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIM.1985.4315400","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4315386","pdfPath":"/iel5/19/4315386/04315400.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Deconvolution","Fast Fourier transforms","Time domain analysis","Electromagnetic scattering","Convolution","Integral equations","Stochastic processes","Pulse generation","Signal to noise ratio","Gradient methods"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Deconvolution of Impulse Response from Time-Limited Input and Output: Theory and Experiment","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4315400/","volume":"IM-34","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2007","publicationDate":"Dec. 1985","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1985","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1985","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Deconvolution of Impulse Response from Time-Limited Input and Output: Theory and Experiment","sourcePdf":"TIM-v34-n4-14.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.044794S","chronDate":"Dec.  1985","isNumber":"4315386","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"19","citationCount":"34","articleId":"4315400","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1985","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4315431,"authors":[{"name":"Denis Fest","firstName":"Denis","lastName":"Fest","id":"37704263900"},{"name":"Jean-Noel Bonnier","affiliation":["Division Equipements Avioniques, Thomson CSF, Malakoff, France"],"firstName":"Jean-Noel","lastName":"Bonnier","id":"38181297400"},{"name":"Jean-Yves Chevalier","affiliation":["Division Equipements Avioniques, Thomson CSF, Malakoff, France"],"firstName":"Jean-Yves","lastName":"Chevalier","id":"37566121000"},{"name":"Remi Brendel","affiliation":["Laboratoire de Physique et de Metrologiedes Oscillateurs, Besancon, France"],"firstName":"Remi","lastName":"Brendel","id":"37285226000"},{"name":"Jean-Jacq Gagnepain","affiliation":["Laboratoire de Physique et de Metrologiedes Oscillateurs, Besancon, France"],"firstName":"Jean-Jacq","lastName":"Gagnepain","id":"37389129600"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9456"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9662"}],"articleNumber":"4315431","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":35},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Instrumentation and Measurement Society","url":"http://www.ieee-ims.org/main/index.php"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4315431","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Noise level","Phase noise","Oscillators","Noise measurement","Phase measurement","Nonlinear filters","Fluctuations","Transfer functions","Acoustic measurements","Frequency"]}],"abstract":"If a signal goes through a linear filter, the transfer function of the filter modifies the spectra of the phase and of the amplitude fluctuations of the signal, and induces a cross spectrum.

Line widths of about 3.4 per cent have been obtained at a pulse height equivalent to 661 kev in NaI. An investigation is being made to determine the causes of this difference. A number of possibilities have been eliminated. Flasher light pulses may be collimated or diffused at the photo surface with no difference in result. They may be mixed with random scintillation pulses giving simultaneously the relatively poor resolution of the scintillator and the good resolution of the flasher. Optical filters do not affect the result when the flasher is used, but do give a relative improvement with a scintillator. It is found that as the light is attenuated in any way from a scintillation crystal, its relative resolution is improved. The improvement is compatible with the concept of an intrinsic crystal resolution. In other words, the difference of the squares of crystal width and flasher width remains constant with varying attenuation. It remains constant also for a given crystal with photomultipliers of different types and resolutions. The intrinsic width indicated for a good crystal is about 6 per cent. Results of experiments attempting to locate the cause of this effect are reported.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4315547/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  1956","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov.  1956","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2007","publicationDate":"Nov. 1956","volume":"3","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Intrinsic Scintillator Resolution","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Intrinsic Scintillator Resolution","sourcePdf":"TNS2-v3-n4-14.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.026662S","chronDate":"Nov.  1956","isNumber":"4315533","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4315440","citationCount":"16","articleId":"4315547","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1956","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4315635,"authors":[{"name":"G.

The two principal causes of poor time resolution in both of these parts are: 1) the different path lengths of electrons originating from separated points on a second, and 2) the effect of initial velocities of the emitted electrons on transit times. The electron optical approach to the alleviation of the transit time spread due to path differences is discussed for both the cathode region and the structure. The focusing spiral method of analyzing the performance of a structure is of considerable value. The effects of initial velocities can be reduced by ensuring that the electron velocities within the photomultiplier are very high. It is not practical to obtain these high velocities simply by applying a high over-all voltage to the tube because of the loss of secondary emission gain and because of internal and external insulation difficulties. However, the necessary high velocities can be obtained by the use of high voltage field electrodes between successive dynodes, so arranged that electrons are rapidly accelerated to a high velocity and then decelerated before they reach the next dynode. A photomultiplier is described whose design is based upon these two principles. A high voltage central electrode system between successive dynodes serves to give electrons the high velocity required to minimize transit time spread.","doi":"10.1109/TNS2.1958.4315635","publicationTitle":"IRE Transactions on Nuclear Science","displayPublicationTitle":"IRE Transactions on Nuclear Science","pdfPath":"/iel5/4315440/4315624/04315635.pdf","startPage":"98","endPage":"104","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNS2.1958.4315635","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4315624","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4315635","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design of Photomultipliers for the Sub-Millimicrosecond Region","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Design of Photomultipliers for the Sub-Millimicrosecond Region","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4315635/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1958","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1958","volume":"5","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2007","publicationDate":"Dec. 1958","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design of Photomultipliers for the Sub-Millimicrosecond Region","sourcePdf":"TNS2-v5-n3-11.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.038562S","chronDate":"Dec.  1958","isNumber":"4315624","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4315440","citationCount":"20","articleId":"4315635","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1958","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2022-01-25"},{"_id":4316189,"authors":[{"name":"Stuart L.

The purpose of this program is to assess GKA characteristics in order to determine if such a device is capable of achieving the high efficiency, gain, and output power predicted by numerous studies. The first in a series of tubes to examine GKA behavior has been fabricated and is currently under testing. This tube utilizes three rectangular cavities operating in the TE101 mode. Design goals included 100-kW output power, 30-percent efficiency, 40-dB gain, and operation at a center frequency of 4.5 GHz. Test results have shown reasonable agreement with theoretical predictions. In particular, efficiencies as high as 33 percent have been observed with a saturated output power of 52 kW. Bandwidths of 0.4 percent have been measured. In addition, the device can be operated under certain conditions as a phase-locked oscillator. These results suggest that the desirable characterstics which have been predicted for the GKA can be realized with a microwave tube.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Klystrons","Frequency","Cyclotrons","Power generation","Laboratories","Power amplifiers","Electrons","Coupling circuits","Magnetic fields","Millimeter wave radar"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TPS.1985.4316455","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Plasma Science","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Plasma Science","pdfPath":"/iel5/27/4316443/04316455.pdf","startPage":"417","endPage":"423","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4316443","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPS.1985.4316455","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design and Performnance of a Three-Cavity Gyroklystron Amplifier","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4316455","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Design and Performnance of a Three-Cavity Gyroklystron Amplifier","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4316455/","volume":"13","issue":"6","publicationDate":"Dec. 1985","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1985","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1985","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design and Performnance of a Three-Cavity Gyroklystron Amplifier","sourcePdf":"TPS-v13-n6-12.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.031682S","chronDate":"Dec.  1985","isNumber":"4316443","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"27","citationCount":"46","articleId":"4316455","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1985","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4316456,"authors":[{"name":"Kwo R.

It is believed that gyrotrons have good potential for development into the high peak power, high gain, efficient amplifier required for this application. Presented here is the detailed design for a 3-cm gyroklystron amplifier at a peak power level of ~ 30 MW. This power level is approximately three orders of magnitude above the gyroklystron state of the art, and a 30-MW experimental study will be a crucial step toward achieving the 300-MW goal. Novel problems associated with a high-energy (\u03b3 ~ 2) gyrotron beam are considered in detail. A new partially self-consistent nonlinear analysis is described and subsequently used to design the gyroklystron circuit. Based on the TE011 mode in cavities of circular cross section, stable operation is anticipated; the current is well below the threshold at which an unbunched electron beam would excite oscillations in the cavities and the drift spaces are designed to heavily load modes which are not cut off.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4316456/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1985","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1985","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"13","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 1985","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2007","displayDocTitle":"A 30-MW Gyroklystron-Amplifier Design for High-Energy Linear Accelerators","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A 30-MW Gyroklystron-Amplifier Design for High-Energy Linear Accelerators","sourcePdf":"TPS-v13-n6-13.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.039178S","chronDate":"Dec.  1985","isNumber":"4316443","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"27","citationCount":"79","articleId":"4316456","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1985","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4316457,"authors":[{"name":"Kwo R.

Because of this unique structure, it offers the promise of moderate- to high-millimeter-wave output power. Experimental results for a fifth-harmonic two-cavity device are compared to both small-signal analytic theory and large-signal numerical calculations which assess gain, bandwidth, sensitivity to longitudinal velocity spread, self-oscillation, and saturation characteristics. Principal theoretical results include the transition to infinite gain as the start-oscillation current threshold is reached as well as the demonstration of the insensitivity of the small-signal gain to parallel velocity spread. The required high-energy rotating electron beam is provided through gyroresonant RF acceleration. To date, over 20 dB of small-signal gain has been achieved at 11.3 GHz in a 1.3-kG magnetic field. The design of a four-cavity configuration is also presented along with simulation of its gain, bandwidth, amplitude modulation (AM) and phase modulation (PM) sensitivity, dependence upon guiding-center spread, and large-signal saturation characteristics. This device has been constructed and initial tests have yielded a gain of 30 dB. Gain in excess of 50 dB is predicted.","doi":"10.1109/TPS.1985.4316457","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPS.1985.4316457","startPage":"435","endPage":"443","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Plasma Science","pdfPath":"/iel5/27/4316443/04316457.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Plasma Science","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4316443","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Theory, Design, and Operation of Large-Orbit High-Harmonic Gyroklystron Amplifiers","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1985","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1985","displayDocTitle":"Theory, Design, and Operation of Large-Orbit High-Harmonic Gyroklystron Amplifiers","publicationDate":"Dec. 1985","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2007","volume":"13","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4316457/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Theory, Design, and Operation of Large-Orbit High-Harmonic Gyroklystron Amplifiers","sourcePdf":"TPS-v13-n6-14.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.032093S","chronDate":"Dec.  1985","isNumber":"4316443","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"27","citationCount":"19","articleId":"4316457","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1985","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":4316459,"authors":[{"name":"Peter Vitello","affiliation":["Science Applications International Corporation, McLean, VA, USA"],"firstName":"Peter","lastName":"Vitello","id":"38179985700"},{"name":"K.

Theoretical modeling has shown that extremely high efficiencies (>90 percent) may be possible for the gyro-peniotron. Stable operation of the gyro-peniotron oscillator requires, however, that mode competition from the electron cyclotron-maser interaction be avoided. This mode competition can be quite serious since the cyclotron-maser start-oscillation currents are generally much smaller than those from the peniotron interaction. We examine here the start-oscillation conditions for the peniotron and the electron cyclotron-maser interactions from linear theory. Both large-orbit axis-encircling and small-orbit off-axis electron beams are investigated. Conditions under which a gyro-peniotron oscillator may be operable are presented, including the important limitations on the spread of the beam guiding center. The results of this study indicate that mode competition for the gyro-peniotron can be easily avoided for TE211 and other low-order azimuthal modes when a large-orbit axis-encircling beam is used. Serious mode competition and gyro-peniotron suppression is found for small-orbit off-axis beams.","doi":"10.1109/TPS.1985.4316459","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPS.1985.4316459","startPage":"454","endPage":"463","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Plasma Science","pdfPath":"/iel5/27/4316443/04316459.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Plasma Science","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4316443","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Mode Competition in the Gyro-Peniotron Oscillator","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1985","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1985","displayDocTitle":"Mode Competition in the Gyro-Peniotron Oscillator","publicationDate":"Dec. 1985","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2007","volume":"13","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4316459/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Mode Competition in the Gyro-Peniotron Oscillator","sourcePdf":"TPS-v13-n6-16.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.027689S","chronDate":"Dec.  1985","isNumber":"4316443","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"27","citationCount":"18","articleId":"4316459","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1985","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":4316530,"authors":[{"name":"M.

Bunched dense electron beams can be used to construct high-power RF sources, which may critically affect future progress in fusion technology. In this paper a system is described in which electrical energy can be converted from a single pulse of relatively long duration into a series of subpulses of short duration (nanosecond and subnanosecond) and of high power (~1010 W). This electrical system consists of an IREB propagating through passive structures. The mutual interaction between the electron beam and one passive structure modifies the IREB so that power compression and beam modulation occur. When the modified IREB interacts with the next passive structure, the kinetic energy of the electrons is converted into electrical energy or RF energy. The beam current modulation depends on the injected IREB and the structure parameters. A 100-percent modulation of the current has been achieved. A single-beam source may be used for exciting radiation in a frequency range of 60 MHz to 10 GHz. In the frequency range of 60-750 MHz a modulated beam with power ~1010 W has already been achieved. IREB modulation at a frequency of ~3 GHz was performed and RF energy was extracted from the bunched beam with power output of 5 \u00d7 108 W.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4316530/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  1986","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"June  1986","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2007","publicationDate":"June 1986","volume":"14","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"High-Power Modulated Intense Relativistic Electron Sources with Applications to RF Generation and Controlled Thermonuclear Fusion","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High-Power Modulated Intense Relativistic Electron Sources with Applications to RF Generation and Controlled Thermonuclear Fusion","sourcePdf":"TPS-v14-n3-3.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.034822S","chronDate":"June  1986","isNumber":"4316527","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"27","citationCount":"28","articleId":"4316530","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1986","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4316708,"authors":[{"name":"H.

One approach to reduce computational cost, information representation, and accelerate knowledge discovery is to eliminate bands that do not add value to the classification and analysis method which is being applied. In particular, algorithms that perform band elimination should be designed to take advantage of the structure of the classification method used. This letter introduces an embedded-feature-selection (EFS) algorithm that is tailored to operate with support vector machines (SVMs) to perform band selection and classification simultaneously. We have successfully applied this algorithm to determine a reasonable subset of bands without any user-defined stopping criteria on some sample AVIRIS images; a problem occurs in benchmarking recursive-feature-elimination methods for the SVMs.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters","pdfPath":"/iel5/8859/4317516/04317520.pdf","startPage":"674","endPage":"677","publicationTitle":"IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters","doi":"10.1109/LGRS.2007.905116","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LGRS.2007.905116","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4317516","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4317520","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Feature Selection and Classification of Hyperspectral Images With Support Vector Machines","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hyperspectral imaging","Support vector machines","Support vector machine classification","Image analysis","Data mining","Computational efficiency","Information representation","Acceleration","Information analysis","Algorithm design and analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feature extraction","geophysical signal processing","geophysical techniques","image classification","remote sensing","spectral analysis","support vector machines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hyperspectral image classification","support vector machines","information representation","knowledge discovery","image analysis","band elimination","embedded feature selection algorithm","band selection","band classification","AVIRIS image"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Feature selection","hyperspectral images","support vector machines (SVMs)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4317520/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 October 2007","displayDocTitle":"Feature Selection and Classification of Hyperspectral Images With Support Vector Machines","volume":"4","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/4317520/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2007","accessionNumber":"9802624","dateOfInsertion":"15 October 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Feature Selection and Classification of Hyperspectral Images With Support Vector Machines","sourcePdf":"04lgrs04-archibald.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.053467S","chronDate":"Oct.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"8859","isNumber":"4317516","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8859","citationCount":"166","xplore-issue":"4317516","articleId":"4317520","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-02"},{"_id":4317521,"authors":[{"name":"Mohamad Awad","affiliation":["National Council for Scientific Research, Beirut, Lebanon"],"firstName":"Mohamad","lastName":"Awad","id":"37411535800"},{"name":"Kacem Chehdi","affiliation":["TSI2M, Universit\u00e9 de Rennes, Rennes, France"],"firstName":"Kacem","lastName":"Chehdi","id":"37313378600"},{"name":"Ahmad Nasri","affiliation":["American University of Beirut, Beirut, Lebanon"],"firstName":"Ahmad","lastName":"Nasri","id":"37337832000"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1545-598X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-0571"}],"articleNumber":"4317521","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":58,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":963},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Society","url":"http://www.grss-ieee.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4317521","abstract":"Image segmentation is an essential process for image analysis. Several methods were developed to segment multicomponent images, and the success of these methods depends on several factors including (1) the characteristics of the acquired image and (2) the percentage of imperfections in the process of image acquisition.

Furthermore, they assume the existence of models that can estimate its parameters and fit to the given data. However, such a parametric approach is not robust, and its performance is severely affected by the correctness of the utilized parametric model. In this letter, a new multicomponent image segmentation method is developed using a nonparametric unsupervised artificial neural network called Kohonen's self-organizing map (SOM) and hybrid genetic algorithm (HGA). SOM is used to detect the main features that are present in the image; then, HGA is used to cluster the image into homogeneous regions without any \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">a priori </i>\nknowledge.

Support vector machine (SVM)-based approaches have been recently proposed for hyperspectral image classification and have raised important interest.

It is shown that approximately the same classification accuracy is obtained using RVM-based classification, with a significantly smaller relevance vector rate and, therefore, much faster testing time, compared with SVM-based classification. This feature makes the RVM-based hyperspectral classification approach more suitable for applications that require low complexity and, possibly, real-time classification.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hyperspectral Image Classification Using Relevance Vector Machines","publicationTitle":"IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters","doi":"10.1109/LGRS.2007.903069","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters","pdfPath":"/iel5/8859/4317516/04317528.pdf","startPage":"586","endPage":"590","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LGRS.2007.903069","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4317516","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4317528","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4317528/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 October 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2007","displayDocTitle":"Hyperspectral Image Classification Using Relevance Vector Machines","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"4","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/4317528/","dateOfInsertion":"15 October 2007","publicationDate":"Oct. 2007","accessionNumber":"9793148","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hyperspectral Image Classification Using Relevance Vector Machines","sourcePdf":"04lgrs04-demir.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.086993S","chronDate":"Oct.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"8859","isNumber":"4317516","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8859","citationCount":"130","xplore-issue":"4317516","articleId":"4317528","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-27"},{"_id":4317532,"authors":[{"name":"H.

Any target motion introduces phases that distort and/or translate the target's image. Target motion produces a smear primarily in the azimuth direction of the SAR image. Time-frequency (TF) modeling is used to analyze and correct the residual phase distortions. An interactive focusing algorithm based on TF modeling demonstrates how to correct the phase and to rapidly focus the mover. This is demonstrated on two watercraft observed in a SAR image. Then, two time-frequency representations (TFRs) are applied to estimate the motion parameters of the movers or refocus them or both. The first is the short-time Fourier transform, from which a velocity profile is constructed based on the length of the smear. The second TFR is the time-frequency distribution series, which is a robust derivative of the Wigner-Ville distribution that works well in this SAR environment. The smear is a modulated chirp, from which a velocity profile is plotted and the phase corrections are integrated to focus the movers. The relationship between these two methods is discussed. Both methods show good agreement on the example.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4317516","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LGRS.2007.896318","publicationTitle":"IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters","pdfPath":"/iel5/8859/4317516/04317537.pdf","startPage":"527","endPage":"531","doi":"10.1109/LGRS.2007.896318","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Motion Analysis in SAR Images of Unfocused Objects Using Time\u2013Frequency Methods","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2007","displayDocTitle":"Motion Analysis in SAR Images of Unfocused Objects Using Time\u2013Frequency Methods","volume":"4","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/4317537/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2007","accessionNumber":"9793156","dateOfInsertion":"15 October 2007","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4317537/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 October 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Motion Analysis in SAR Images of Unfocused Objects Using Time\u2013Frequency Methods","sourcePdf":"04lgrs04-kersten.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.048791S","chronDate":"Oct.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"8859","isNumber":"4317516","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8859","citationCount":"40","xplore-issue":"4317516","articleId":"4317537","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4317542,"authors":[{"name":"Barbara Penna","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Elettronica, Politecnico di Turino, Torino, Italy"],"firstName":"Barbara","lastName":"Penna","id":"37298152400"},{"name":"Tammam Tillo","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Elettronica, Politecnico di Turino, Torino, Italy"],"firstName":"Tammam","lastName":"Tillo","id":"37271824200"},{"name":"Enrico Magli","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Elettronica, Politecnico di Turino, Torino, Italy"],"firstName":"Enrico","lastName":"Magli","id":"37267305900"},{"name":"Gabriella Olmo","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Elettronica, Politecnico di Turino, Torino, Italy"],"firstName":"Gabriella","lastName":"Olmo","id":"37271822800"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1545-598X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-0571"}],"articleNumber":"4317542","dbTime":"19 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":28,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":403},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Society","url":"http://www.grss-ieee.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hyperspectral imaging","Image coding","Pixel","Compression algorithms","Karhunen-Loeve transforms","Transform coding","Infrared imaging","Infrared spectra","Spectroscopy","Layout"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data compression","geophysical techniques","image coding","Karhunen-Loeve transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["anomalous pixels model","lossy compression algorithm","hyperspectral images","spectral Karhunen-Loeve transform","spatial JPEG 2000","Airborne Visible-Infrared Imaging Spectrometer","rate-distortion performance","anomaly detection performance"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Anomaly detection","discrete wavelet transform (DWT)","hyperspectral data","JPEG 2000","Karhunen\u2013Lo\u00c8ve transform (KLT)","lossy compression","Reed\u2013Xiaoli (RX) algorithm","wavelet"]}],"abstract":"We propose a new lossy compression algorithm for hyperspectral images, which is based on the spectral Karhunen-Loeve transform, followed by spatial JPEG 2000, which employs a model of anomalous pixels during the compression process.

A detector for speech presence in the short-time Fourier transform domain is combined with an estimator, which jointly minimizes a cost function that takes into account both detection and estimation errors. Cost parameters control the tradeoff between speech distortion, caused by missed detection of speech components and residual musical noise resulting from false-detection. Furthermore, a modified decision-directed a priori signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) estimation is proposed for transient-noise environments. Experimental results demonstrate the advantage of using the proposed simultaneous detection and estimation approach with the proposed a priori SNR estimator, which facilitate suppression of transient noise with a controlled level of speech distortion.","doi":"10.1109/TASL.2007.904231","startPage":"2348","endPage":"2359","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/10376/4317554/04317555.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TASL.2007.904231","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4317554","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Simultaneous Detection and Estimation Approach for Speech Enhancement","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Speech enhancement","Detectors","Working environment noise","Amplitude estimation","Signal to noise ratio","Degradation","Uncertainty","Fourier transforms","Signal detection","Noise generators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Fourier transforms","speech enhancement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["speech enhancement","short-time Fourier transform domain","speech distortion","residual musical noise","signal-to-noise ratio estimation","transient-noise environment"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Acoustic noise","estimation","signal detection","siren noise","spectral analysis","speech enhancement"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4317555/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 October 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2007","displayDocTitle":"Simultaneous Detection and Estimation Approach for Speech Enhancement","volume":"15","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/4317555/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"15 October 2007","accessionNumber":"10006771","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Simultaneous Detection and Estimation Approach for Speech Enhancement","sourcePdf":"15tasl08-abramson.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.080476S","chronDate":"Nov.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"10376","isNumber":"4317554","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10376","citationCount":"51","xplore-issue":"4317554","articleId":"4317555","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-10"},{"_id":4317556,"authors":[{"name":"Mohamed Afify","affiliation":["IBM Thomas J.

This paper first presents a theoretical analysis of MCE/GPD. The focus is on a simple classification problem for estimating the means of two Gaussian classes. For this simple algorithm, we derive difference equations for the class means and decision threshold during learning, and develop closed form expressions for the evolution of both the smoothed and true error. In addition, we show that the decision threshold converges to its optimal value, and provide an estimate of the number of iterations needed to approach convergence. After convergence the class means drift towards increasing their distance to infinity without contributing to the decrease of the classification error. This behavior, referred to as mean drift, is then related to the increase of the variance of the classifier. The theoretical results perfectly agree with simulations carried out for a two-class Gaussian classification problem. In addition to the obtained theoretical results we experimentally verify, in speech recognition experiments, that MCE/GPD learning of Gaussian mixture hidden Markov models qualitatively follows the pattern suggested by the theoretical analysis. We also discuss links between MCE/GPD learning and both batch gradient descent and extended Baum-Welch re-estimation. The latter two approaches are known to be popular in large scale implementations of discriminative training. Hence, the proposed analysis can be used, at least as a rough guideline, for better understanding of the properties of discriminative training algorithms for speech recognition.","doi":"10.1109/TASL.2007.903304","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/10376/4317554/04317556.pdf","startPage":"2405","endPage":"2417","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TASL.2007.903304","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4317554","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Statistical Analysis of Minimum Classification Error Learning for Gaussian and Hidden Markov Model Classifiers","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4317556","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 October 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4317556/","displayDocTitle":"Statistical Analysis of Minimum Classification Error Learning for Gaussian and Hidden Markov Model Classifiers","volume":"15","issue":"8","publicationDate":"Nov. 2007","accessionNumber":"10006772","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4317556/","dateOfInsertion":"15 October 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Statistical Analysis of Minimum Classification Error Learning for Gaussian and Hidden Markov Model Classifiers","sourcePdf":"15tasl08-afify.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.096291S","chronDate":"Nov.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"10376","isNumber":"4317554","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10376","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4317554","articleId":"4317556","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4317557,"authors":[{"name":"Enrique Alexandre","affiliation":["Department of Signal Theory and Communications Escuela Polit\u00e9cnica Superior, University of Alcal\u00e1, Madrid, Spain"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/10376/4317554/4317557/4317557-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Enrique Alexandre (S'99\u2013M'04) received the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in telecommunication engineering from the University of Vigo, Vigo, Spain, in 1999 and 2004, respectively.","He is currently an Associate Professor in the Department of Signal Theory and Communications, University of Alcal\u00e1, Alcal\u00e1 de Henares, Spain.

This is because most hearing aids on the market cannot automatically adapt to the changing acoustical environment the user faces daily. This paper focuses on the development of an automatic sound classifier for digital hearing aids that aims to enhance listening comprehension when the user goes from one sound environment to another. Given the strong complexity constraints of these devices, reducing the number of signal-describing features which feed the automatic classifier is of great importance and becomes a challenging topic. Thus, the use of genetic algorithms with restricted search is explored for the mentioned feature selection. In an effort to evaluate its performance, the algorithm is compared with a standard unconstrained genetic algorithm and with sequential methods. The restricted search driven by the implemented genetic algorithm performs better than both the sequential methods and unconstrained genetic algorithms. It thus allows a subset of signal-describing features with lower cardinality to be selected. This may permit these selected features to be programmed on the digital signal processor that the hearing aid is based on, and to make efficient use of its limited computational facilities.","doi":"10.1109/TASL.2007.905139","startPage":"2249","endPage":"2256","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TASL.2007.905139","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4317554","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/10376/4317554/04317557.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Feature Selection for Sound Classification in Hearing Aids Through Restricted Search Driven by Genetic Algorithms","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4317557/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Feature Selection for Sound Classification in Hearing Aids Through Restricted Search Driven by Genetic Algorithms","volume":"15","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/4317557/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10006773","publicationDate":"Nov. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"15 October 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 October 2007","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Feature Selection for Sound Classification in Hearing Aids Through Restricted Search Driven by Genetic Algorithms","sourcePdf":"15tasl08-alexandre.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.060092S","chronDate":"Nov.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"10376","isNumber":"4317554","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10376","citationCount":"26","xplore-issue":"4317554","articleId":"4317557","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-11"},{"_id":4317561,"authors":[{"name":"Jacek P.

Despite the proven efficacy of steered-beamformer approaches to localization in harsh conditions, their practical application to real-time settings is hindered by undesirably high computational demands. This paper presents a computationally viable implementation of the steered response power (SRP) source localization method. The conventional approach is generalized by introducing an inverse mapping that maps relative delays to sets of candidate locations. Instead of traversing the three-dimensional location space, the one-dimensional relative delay space is traversed; at each lag, all locations which are inverse mapped by that delay are updated. This means that the computation of the SRP map is no longer performed sequentially in space. Most importantly, by subsetting the space of relative delays to only those that achieve a high level of cross-correlation, the required number of algorithm updates is drastically reduced without compromising localization accuracy. The generalization is scalable in the sense that the level of subsetting is an algorithm parameter. It is shown that this generalization may be viewed as a spatial decomposition of the SRP energy map into weighted basis functions-in this context, it becomes evident that the full SRP search considers all basis functions (even the ones with very low weighting). On the other hand, it is shown that by only including a few basis functions per microphone pair, the SRP map is quite accurately represented. As a result, in a real environment, the proposed generalization achieves virtually the same anomaly rate as the full SRP search while only performing 10% the amount of algorithm updates as the full search.","doi":"10.1109/TASL.2007.906694","startPage":"2510","endPage":"2526","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/10376/4317554/04317561.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TASL.2007.906694","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4317554","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Generalized Steered Response Power Method for Computationally Viable Source Localization","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Microphone arrays","Delay","Acoustic arrays","Array signal processing","Signal processing algorithms","Position measurement","Jacobian matrices","Acoustic measurements","Acoustic signal processing","Cameras"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["acoustic signal processing","array signal processing","microphone arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["steered response power method","computationally viable acoustic source localization","multiple microphones","array signal processing problem","steered-beamformer approaches","SRP source localization method","inverse mapping"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Microphone arrays","source localization","spectral estimation","steered response power (SRP)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4317561/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 October 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2007","displayDocTitle":"A Generalized Steered Response Power Method for Computationally Viable Source Localization","volume":"15","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/4317561/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"15 October 2007","accessionNumber":"10006778","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Generalized Steered Response Power Method for Computationally Viable Source Localization","sourcePdf":"15tasl08-dmochowski.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.117883S","chronDate":"Nov.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"10376","isNumber":"4317554","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10376","citationCount":"100","xplore-issue":"4317554","articleId":"4317561","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4317568,"authors":[{"name":"Kenichi Kumatani","affiliation":["IDIAP Research Institute, Martigny, Switzerland","Institute for Computer Science and Engineering, Intelligent Sensor-Actuator Systems (ISAS), University of Karlsruhe, Karlsruhe, Germany"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/10376/4317554/4317568/4317568-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Kenichi Kumatani (M'02) received the B.E. degree in electrical and electronics engineering from Kobe University, Kobe, Japan, in 1999 and the M.E. degree from the Graduate School of Information Science, Nara Institute of Science and Technology (NAIST), Nara, Japan, in 2001.","In 2001, he was an Intern with the ATR Spoken Language Translation Research Laboratories, Kyoto, Japan.

We construct one subband-domain beamformer in generalized sidelobe canceller (GSC) configuration for each source. In contrast to normal practice, we then jointly optimize the active weight vectors of both GSCs to obtain two output signals with minimum mutual information (MMI). Assuming that the subband snapshots are Gaussian-distributed, this MMI criterion reduces to the requirement that the cross-correlation coefficient of the subband outputs of the two GSCs vanishes. We also compare separation performance under the Gaussian assumption with that obtained from several super-Gaussian probability density functions (pdfs), namely, the Laplace and pdfs. Our proposed technique provides effective nulling of the undesired source, but without the signal cancellation problems seen in conventional beamforming. Moreover, our technique does not suffer from the source permutation and scaling ambiguities encountered in conventional blind source separation algorithms. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed technique through a series of far-field automatic speech recognition experiments on data from the PASCAL Speech Separation Challenge (SSC). On the SSC development data, the simple delay-and-sum beamformer achieves a word error rate (WER) of 70.4%. The MMI beamformer under a Gaussian assumption achieves a 55.2% WER, which is further reduced to 52.0% with a pdf, whereas the WER for data recorded with a close-talking microphone is 21.6%.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/10376/4317554/04317568.pdf","startPage":"2527","endPage":"2541","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","doi":"10.1109/TASL.2007.907430","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TASL.2007.907430","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4317554","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4317568","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive Beamforming With a Minimum Mutual Information Criterion","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Array signal processing","Mutual information","Acoustic applications","Loudspeakers","Gaussian processes","Probability density function","Blind source separation","Automatic speech recognition","Delay","Error analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["acoustic signal processing","array signal processing","Gaussian distribution","probability","speaker recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive acoustic beamforming","minimum mutual information criterion","subband-domain beamformer","generalized sidelobe canceller","Gaussian-distribution","cross-correlation coefficient","super Gaussian probability density function"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Beamforming","microphone arrays","source separation","speech recognition"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4317568/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 October 2007","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive Beamforming With a Minimum Mutual Information Criterion","volume":"15","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/4317568/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2007","accessionNumber":"10006785","dateOfInsertion":"15 October 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive Beamforming With a Minimum Mutual Information Criterion","sourcePdf":"15tasl08-kumatani.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.158561S","chronDate":"Nov.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"10376","isNumber":"4317554","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10376","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"4317554","articleId":"4317568","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4317570,"authors":[{"name":"Xinwei Li","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, York University, Toronto, ONT, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/10376/4317554/4317570/4317570-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Xinwei Li recieved the B.S. degree in electronics from Beijing University, Beijing, China, and the M.S. degree in computer science from York University, Toronto, ON, Canada.","He is a speech scientist with Nuance, Inc.

First, we introduce a new constraint for LME to guarantee the boundedness of the margin of CDHMM. Second, we show that the LME problem subject to this new constraint can be formulated as an SDP problem under some relaxation conditions. Therefore, it can be solved using many efficient optimization algorithms specially designed for SDP. The new LME/SDP method has been evaluated on a speaker independent E-set speech recognition task using the ISOLET database and a connected digit string recognition task using the TIDIGITS database. Experimental results clearly demonstrate that large-margin estimation via semidefinite programing (LME/SDP) can significantly reduce word error rate (WER) over other existing CDHMM training methods, such as MLE and MCE. It has also been shown that the new SDP-based method largely outperforms the previously proposed LME optimization methods using gradient descent search.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/10376/4317554/04317570.pdf","startPage":"2383","endPage":"2392","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","doi":"10.1109/TASL.2007.905151","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TASL.2007.905151","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4317554","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4317570","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Solving Large-Margin Hidden Markov Model Estimation via Semidefinite Programming","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hidden Markov models","Optimization methods","Speech recognition","Maximum likelihood estimation","Constraint optimization","Databases","Automatic speech recognition","Computer science","Minimax techniques","Quadratic programming"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["estimation theory","gradient methods","hidden Markov models","optimisation","relaxation theory","speech recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["speech recognition","continuous density hidden Markov model","semidefinite programming optimization method","large-margin estimation method","relaxation condition","connected digit string recognition task","word error rate","gradient descent search","speaker independent e-set"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Continuous-density hidden Markov models (CDHMMs)","convex optimization","large-margin classifers","large-margin hidden Markov models","semidefinite programming (SDP)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4317570/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 October 2007","displayDocTitle":"Solving Large-Margin Hidden Markov Model Estimation via Semidefinite Programming","volume":"15","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/4317570/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2007","accessionNumber":"10006787","dateOfInsertion":"15 October 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Solving Large-Margin Hidden Markov Model Estimation via Semidefinite Programming","sourcePdf":"15tasl08-li2.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.081268S","chronDate":"Nov.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"10376","isNumber":"4317554","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10376","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"4317554","articleId":"4317570","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":4317572,"authors":[{"name":"Hari Krishna Maganti","affiliation":[" Institute of Neural Information Processing, University of Ulater, Ulm, Germany"],"firstName":"Hari Krishna","lastName":"Maganti","id":"38269943600"},{"name":"Daniel Gatica-Perez","affiliation":["IDIAP Research Institute and Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne, Martigny, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Daniel","lastName":"Gatica-Perez","id":"38277862200"},{"name":"Iain McCowan","affiliation":["CSIRO eHealth Research Centre and Speech and Audio Research Laboratory, Queensland University of Technology, Brisbane, QLD, Australia"],"firstName":"Iain","lastName":"McCowan","id":"37279209300"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1558-7916"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-7924"}],"articleNumber":"4317572","dbTime":"50 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":34,"citationCountPatent":11,"totalDownloads":699},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.signalprocessingsociety.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sensor arrays","Speech enhancement","Speech recognition","Microphone arrays","Array signal processing","Speech analysis","Cameras","Filtering","Performance evaluation","Sensor systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","audio signal processing","audio-visual systems","filtering theory","microphone arrays","speaker recognition","speech enhancement","tracking filters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["speech enhancement","speech recognition","multiparty meetings","distant speech acquisition problem","audio-visual sensor array","microphone array beamforming techniques","audio-visual multiperson tracker","postfiltering stage"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Audio\u2013visual fusion","microphone array processing","multiobject tracking","speech enhancement","speech recognition"]}],"abstract":"This paper addresses the problem of distant speech acquisition in multiparty meetings, using multiple microphones and cameras. Microphone array beamforming techniques present a potential alternative to close-talking microphones by providing speech enhancement through spatial filtering. Beamforming techniques, however, rely on knowledge of the speaker location. In this paper, we present an integrated approach, in which an audio-visual multiperson tracker is used to track active speakers with high accuracy. Speech enhancement is then achieved using microphone array beamforming followed by a novel postfiltering stage. Finally, speech recognition is performed to evaluate the quality of the enhanced speech signal. The approach is evaluated on data recorded in a real meeting room for stationary speaker, moving speaker, and overlapping speech scenarios. The results show that the speech enhancement and recognition performance achieved using our approach are significantly better than a single table-top microphone and are comparable to a lapel microphone for some of the scenarios. The results also indicate that the audio-visual-based system performs significantly better than audio-only system, both in terms of enhancement and recognition. This reveals that the accurate speaker tracking provided by the audio-visual sensor array proved beneficial to improve the recognition performance in a microphone array-based speech recognition system.","doi":"10.1109/TASL.2007.906197","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/10376/4317554/04317572.pdf","startPage":"2257","endPage":"2269","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TASL.2007.906197","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4317554","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Speech Enhancement and Recognition in Meetings With an Audio\u2013Visual Sensor Array","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4317572","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 October 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4317572/","displayDocTitle":"Speech Enhancement and Recognition in Meetings With an Audio\u2013Visual Sensor Array","volume":"15","issue":"8","publicationDate":"Nov. 2007","accessionNumber":"10006789","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"15 October 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Speech Enhancement and Recognition in Meetings With an Audio\u2013Visual Sensor Array","sourcePdf":"15tasl08-maganti.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.08202S","chronDate":"Nov.  2007","isNumber":"4317554","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10376","citationCount":"34","articleId":"4317572","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4317574,"authors":[{"name":"Mohammad H.

The soft mask filter's parameters are estimated using the mean and variance of the underlying sources which are modeled using the Gaussian composite source modeling (CSM) approach. It is also shown that the binary mask filter which has been empirically and extensively used in single-channel speech separation techniques is, in fact, a simplified form of the soft mask filter.

The method is based on a revised contextual likelihood ratio test (LRT) defined over a multiple observation window. The motivations for revising the original multiple observation LRT (MO-LRT) are found in its artificially added hangover mechanism that exhibits an incorrect behavior under different signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) conditions. The new approach defines a maximum a posteriori (MAP) statistical test in which all the global hypotheses on the multiple observation window containing up to one speech-to-nonspeech or nonspeech-to-speech transitions are considered. Thus, the implicit hangover mechanism artificially added by the original method was not found in the revised method so its design can be further improved. With these and other innovations, the proposed method showed a higher speech/nonspeech discrimination accuracy over a wide range of SNR conditions when compared to the original MO-LRT voice activity detector (VAD). Experiments conducted on the AURORA databases and tasks showed that the revised method yields significant improvements in speech recognition performance over standardized VADs such as ITU T G.729 and ETSI AMR for discontinuous voice transmission and the ETSI AFE for distributed speech recognition (DSR), as well as over recently reported methods.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/10376/4317554/04317575.pdf","startPage":"2177","endPage":"2189","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improved Voice Activity Detection Using Contextual Multiple Hypothesis Testing for Robust Speech Recognition","doi":"10.1109/TASL.2007.903937","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4317554","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TASL.2007.903937","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4317575","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4317575/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 October 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2007","displayDocTitle":"Improved Voice Activity Detection Using Contextual Multiple Hypothesis Testing for Robust Speech Recognition","dateOfInsertion":"15 October 2007","publicationDate":"Nov. 2007","accessionNumber":"10006792","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"15","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/4317575/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improved Voice Activity Detection Using Contextual Multiple Hypothesis Testing for Robust Speech Recognition","sourcePdf":"15tasl08-ramirez.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.070883S","chronDate":"Nov.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"10376","isNumber":"4317554","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10376","citationCount":"31","xplore-issue":"4317554","articleId":"4317575","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4317577,"authors":[{"name":"Leslie S.

A Gaussian mixture model (GMM) of the joint probability density of source and target features is employed for performing spectral conversion between speakers. The conventional method converts spectral parameters frame by frame based on the minimum mean square error. Although it is reasonably effective, the deterioration of speech quality is caused by some problems: 1) appropriate spectral movements are not always caused by the frame-based conversion process, and 2) the converted spectra are excessively smoothed by statistical modeling. In order to address those problems, we propose a conversion method based on the maximum-likelihood estimation of a spectral parameter trajectory. Not only static but also dynamic feature statistics are used for realizing the appropriate converted spectrum sequence. Moreover, the oversmoothing effect is alleviated by considering a global variance feature of the converted spectra. Experimental results indicate that the performance of VC can be dramatically improved by the proposed method in view of both speech quality and conversion accuracy for speaker individuality.","doi":"10.1109/TASL.2007.907344","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/10376/4317554/04317579.pdf","startPage":"2222","endPage":"2235","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4317554","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TASL.2007.907344","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Voice Conversion Based on Maximum-Likelihood Estimation of Spectral Parameter Trajectory","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4317579","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2007","displayDocTitle":"Voice Conversion Based on Maximum-Likelihood Estimation of Spectral Parameter Trajectory","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4317579/","publicationDate":"Nov. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"15 October 2007","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"10006796","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4317579/","volume":"15","issue":"8","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 October 2007","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Voice Conversion Based on Maximum-Likelihood Estimation of Spectral Parameter Trajectory","sourcePdf":"15tasl08-toda.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.086792S","chronDate":"Nov.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"10376","isNumber":"4317554","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10376","citationCount":"463","xplore-issue":"4317554","articleId":"4317579","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4317585,"authors":[{"name":"Zohra Yermeche","affiliation":["Department of Signal Processing, Blekinge Institute of Technology, Ronneby, Sweden"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/10376/4317554/4317585/4317585-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Zohra Yermeche (M'01) received the Dipl.

This blind approach is based on a two-stage scheme. First, a subband time-delay estimation method is used to localize the dominant speech source. The second stage involves speech enhancement, based on the acquired spatial information, by means of a soft-constrained subband beamformer. The novelty of the proposed method involves considering the spatial spreading of the sound source as equivalent to a time-delay spreading, thus, allowing for the estimated intersensor time-delays to be directly used in the beamforming operations. In comparison to previous approaches, this new method requires no special array geometry, knowledge of the array manifold, or acquisition of calibration data to adapt the array weights. Furthermore, such a scheme allows for the beamformer to efficiently adapt to speaker movement. The robustness of the time-delay estimation of speech signals in high noise levels is improved by making use of the non-Gaussian nature of speech trough a subband Kurtosis-weighted structure. Evaluation in a real environment with a moving speaker shows promising results, with suppression levels of up to 16 dB for background noise and interfering (speech) signals, associated to a relatively small effect of speech distortion.","doi":"10.1109/TASL.2007.903309","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/10376/4317554/04317585.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4317554","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TASL.2007.903309","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","startPage":"2360","endPage":"2372","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Blind Subband Beamforming With Time-Delay Constraints for Moving Source Speech Enhancement","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4317585","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 October 2007","displayDocTitle":"Blind Subband Beamforming With Time-Delay Constraints for Moving Source Speech Enhancement","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4317585/","volume":"15","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/4317585/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2007","accessionNumber":"10006802","dateOfInsertion":"15 October 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Blind Subband Beamforming With Time-Delay Constraints for Moving Source Speech Enhancement","sourcePdf":"15tasl08-yermeche.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.0995S","chronDate":"Nov.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"10376","isNumber":"4317554","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10376","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4317554","articleId":"4317585","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":4317586,"authors":[{"name":"Jingyi Zhang","affiliation":["School of Electrical Electronic and Computer Engineering, University of Newcastle, Newcastle-upon-Tyne, UK"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/10376/4317554/4317586/4317586-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jingyi Zhang was born in China in 1980.

The proposed model extends the conventional linear instantaneous mixture model to include both convolutive mixing and postnonlinear distortion. The maximum-likelihood (ML) approach solution based on the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm is developed to estimate the source signals and the parameters in the proposed nonlinear model. In the proposed solution, the sufficient statistics associated with the source signals are estimated in the E-step, while the model parameters are optimized through these statistics in the M-step. However, the complication resulted from the postnonlinear function associated with the mixture renders these statistics difficult to be formulated in a closed form and hence causes intractability in the parameter optimization. A computationally efficient algorithm is proposed which uses the extended Kalman smoother (EKS) to facilitate the E-step tractable and a set of self-updated polynomials is used as the nonlinearity estimator to facilitate closed form estimations of the parameters in the M-step. The theoretical foundation of the proposed solution has been rigorously developed and discussed in details. Both simulations and recorded speech signals have been carried out to verify the success and efficacy of the proposed algorithm. Remarkable improvement has been obtained when compared with the existing algorithms.","doi":"10.1109/TASL.2007.903310","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/10376/4317554/04317586.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TASL.2007.903310","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4317554","startPage":"2311","endPage":"2330","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Blind Source Separation of Postnonlinear Convolutive Mixture","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4317586","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Blind Source Separation of Postnonlinear Convolutive Mixture","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4317586/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 October 2007","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"15","issue":"8","publicationDate":"Nov. 2007","accessionNumber":"10006803","dateOfInsertion":"15 October 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4317586/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Blind Source Separation of Postnonlinear Convolutive Mixture","sourcePdf":"15tasl08-zhang.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.114828S","chronDate":"Nov.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"10376","isNumber":"4317554","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10376","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"4317554","articleId":"4317586","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4317588,"authors":[{"name":"John G.

For the die-attachment, the nanosilver pastes were printed onto silver-coated or gold-coated direct-bond-copper (DBC) substrates. After die-attaching the SiC devices, the assemblies were heated to 300 with a 40-min dwell time to develop bonding up to 40 MPa on the silver-coated substrates, which was comparable to that of the Pb37Sn63 solder die-attachment. Scanning acoustic microscopy (SAM) of the sintered silver die-attachment did not reveal any detectable voids, while scanning electron microscopy (SEM) showed the presence of uniformly distributed microscale pores. Because of the porous microstructure of the sintered silver and its low apparent elastic modulus, it could help relieve thermomechanical stresses in the die-attachment assembly. Finally, since silver die-attachment is almost pure in constituent (>99%), the die-attachment could enable packaging of wide bandgap semiconductors devices, such as SiC or GaN, for high-temperature operation.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 October 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4317588/","volume":"30","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/4317588/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10006766","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"08 October 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Processing and Characterization of Nanosilver Pastes for Die-Attaching SiC Devices","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Processing and Characterization of Nanosilver Pastes for Die-Attaching SiC Devices","sourcePdf":"30tepm04-bai.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.044628S","chronDate":"Oct.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"6104","isNumber":"4317587","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6104","citationCount":"113","xplore-issue":"4317587","articleId":"4317588","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4317592,"authors":[{"name":"J.

Although operators examine OCT images manually, the establishment of an automated inspection technique is required from the viewpoint of an operator's load and the fluctuation of the inspection results. In this paper, a novel automated solder inspection technique by means of OCT is proposed. This technique consists of position adjustment, bump extraction, character extraction and judgement. Moreover, by combining five characteristic features, the condition of a solder bump was determined in computer algorithm. In this paper, linear discriminate analysis and an artificial neural network technique are introduced as the determination methods. In the experiments, these techniques are evaluated by using actual BGA-mounted substrates.

The introduction of low- material into silicon imposed challenges on dicing saw process. ILD and metal layers peeling and its penetration into the sealing ring of the die during dicing saw are the most common defects. In this paper, the low- material structure and its impact on wafer dicing were elaborated. A practical dicing quality inspection matrix was developed to assess the cutting process variation. A 300-mm CMOS90-nm dual damascene low- wafer was chosen as a test vehicle to develop a robust low- dicing saw process. The critical factors (dicing blade, index speed, spindle speed, cut in depth, test pattern in the saw street, etc.) affecting cutting quality were studied and optimized. The selected C90 Dual damascene low- device passed package reliability tests with the optimized low- dicing saw recipe and process. The further improvement and solutions in eliminating the low- dicing saw peeling were also explored.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 October 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4317597/","volume":"30","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/4317597/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10006770","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"08 October 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"300-mm Low-<formula formulatype=\"inline\"><tex>${\\hbox {k}}$</tex></formula> Wafer Dicing Saw Development","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"300-mm Low-<formula formulatype=\"inline\"><tex>${\\hbox {k}}$</tex></formula> Wafer Dicing Saw Development","sourcePdf":"30tepm04-zhijie.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.046577S","chronDate":"Oct.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"6104","isNumber":"4317587","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6104","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"4317587","articleId":"4317597","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4317619,"authors":[{"name":"Giorgos Karopoulos","affiliation":["University of Aegean, Greece"],"bio":{"p":["Giorgos Karopoulos (gkar@aegean.gr) is currently a Ph.D. candidate at the University of the Aegean, department of Information and Communication Systems Engineering.

Encryption only protects communication from being decoded by unauthorised parties, whereas covert channels aim to hide the very existence of the communication. Initially, covert channels were identified as a security threat on monolithic systems i.e. mainframes. More recently focus has shifted towards covert channels in computer network protocols. The huge amount of data and vast number of different protocols in the Internet seems ideal as a high-bandwidth vehicle for covert communication. This article is a survey of the existing techniques for creating covert channels in widely deployed network and application protocols.

This work describes the current state-of-the-art in SVC, focusing on wavelet based motion-compensated approaches (WSVC). It reviews individual components that have been designed to address the problem over the years and how such components are typically combined to achieve meaningful WSVC architectures. Coding schemes which mainly differ from the space-time order in which the wavelet transforms operate are here compared, discussing strengths and weaknesses of the resulting implementations. An evaluation of the achievable coding performances is provided considering the reference architectures studied and developed by ISO/MPEG in its exploration on WSVC. The paper also attempts to draw a list of major differences between wavelet based solutions and the SVC standard jointly targeted by ITU and ISO/MPEG. A major emphasis is devoted to a promising WSVC solution, named STP-tool, which presents architectural similarities with respect to the SVC standard. The paper ends drawing some evolution trends for WSVC systems and giving insights on video coding applications which could benefit by a wavelet based approach.","doi":"10.1109/TCSVT.2007.906828","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/76/4317621/04317622.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4317621","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSVT.2007.906828","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","startPage":"1238","endPage":"1255","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"State-of-the-Art and Trends in Scalable Video Compression With Wavelet-Based Approaches","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4317622","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 September 2007","displayDocTitle":"State-of-the-Art and Trends in Scalable Video Compression With Wavelet-Based Approaches","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4317622/","volume":"17","issue":"9","htmlLink":"/document/4317622/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2007","accessionNumber":"9624810","dateOfInsertion":"24 September 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"State-of-the-Art and Trends in Scalable Video Compression With Wavelet-Based Approaches","sourcePdf":"17tcsvt09-adami.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.113306S","chronDate":"Sept.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"76","isNumber":"4317621","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"76","citationCount":"64","xplore-issue":"4317621","articleId":"4317622","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4317624,"authors":[{"name":"Isabelle Amonou","affiliation":["Orange Laboratories-France Telecom Research and Development, Rennes, France"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/76/4317621/4317624/4317624-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Isabelle Amonou graduated from the Institut National des Sciences Appliqu\u00e9es in 1989 and received the Ph.D. degree in digital image processing from the Ecole Nationale Sup\u00e9rieure des T\u00e9l\u00e9communications, Paris, France, in 2001.","She is currently a Research and Development Engineer at Orange Labs/France Telecom R&D, Rennes, France.

By using the Quality Layers post-processing to evaluate and signal the impact on rate and distortion of the various enhancement information pieces, a significant gain is achieved: quality layers significantly outperform the basic standard extractor that was initially proposed in SVC. For the standard set of test sequences, in a range of acceptable video quality, an average quality gain of up to 0.5 dB is achieved. Furthermore, the technique can be used for combined (spatial, temporal and quality) scalability. Thanks to the signaling of this information in the header of the network abstraction layer units or in a supplemental enhancement information message, the adaptation can be performed with a simple parser, e.g., at decoder side or in an intelligent network node designed for rate adaptation.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4317624/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 September 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"17","issue":"9","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"24 September 2007","accessionNumber":"9624812","htmlLink":"/document/4317624/","displayDocTitle":"Optimized Rate-Distortion Extraction With Quality Layers in the Scalable Extension of H.264/AVC","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimized Rate-Distortion Extraction With Quality Layers in the Scalable Extension of H.264/AVC","sourcePdf":"17tcsvt09-amonou.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.065016S","chronDate":"Sept.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"76","isNumber":"4317621","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"76","citationCount":"95","xplore-issue":"4317621","articleId":"4317624","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4317635,"authors":[{"name":"Thomas Schierl","affiliation":["Fraunhofer Institute for Telecommunications, Heinrich-Hertz-Institute, Berlin, Germany"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/76/4317621/4317635/4317635-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Thomas Schierl (M'06) received the Dipl.-Ing. degree in computer engineering from the Berlin University of Technology, Berlin, Germany in December 2003.","He has been with Fraunhofer Institute for Telecommunications, Heinrich-Hertz Institute (HHI), Berlin, Germany, since 2003.

Scalability of a video bit stream allows for media bit rate as well as for device capability adaptation. Moreover, adaptation of the bit rate of a video signal is a desirable key feature, if limitation in network resources, mostly characterized by throughput variations, varying delay or transmission errors, need to be considered. Typically, in mobile networks the throughput, delay and errors of a connection (link) depend on the current reception conditions, which are largely influenced by a number of physical factors. In order to cope with the typically varying characteristics of mobile communication channels in unicast, multicast, or broadcast services, different methods for increasing robustness and achieving quality of service are desirable. We will give an overview of SVC and its relation to mobile delivery methods. Furthermore, innovative use cases are introduced which apply SVC in mobile networks.","doi":"10.1109/TCSVT.2007.905528","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/76/4317621/04317635.pdf","startPage":"1204","endPage":"1217","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSVT.2007.905528","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4317621","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Mobile Video Transmission Using Scalable Video Coding","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4317635","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 September 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4317635/","displayDocTitle":"Mobile Video Transmission Using Scalable Video Coding","volume":"17","issue":"9","publicationDate":"Sept. 2007","accessionNumber":"9624815","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4317635/","dateOfInsertion":"24 September 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Mobile Video Transmission Using Scalable Video Coding","sourcePdf":"17tcsvt09-schierl.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.095337S","chronDate":"Sept.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"76","isNumber":"4317621","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"76","citationCount":"203","xplore-issue":"4317621","articleId":"4317635","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4317636,"authors":[{"name":"Heiko Schwarz","affiliation":["Fraunhofer Institute for Telecommunications, Heinrich-Hertz-Institute, Berlin, Germany"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/76/4317621/4317636/4317636-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Heiko Schwarz received the Dipl.-Ing. degree in electrical engineering and the Dr.-Ing. degree, from the University of Rostock, Rostock, Germany, in 1996 and 2000, respectively.","In 1999, he joined the Fraunhofer Institute for Telecommunications, Heinrich Hertz Institute (HHI), Berlin, Germany.

The Joint Video Team of the ITU-T VCEG and the ISO/IEC MPEG has now also standardized a Scalable Video Coding (SVC) extension of the H.264/AVC standard. SVC enables the transmission and decoding of partial bit streams to provide video services with lower temporal or spatial resolutions or reduced fidelity while retaining a reconstruction quality that is high relative to the rate of the partial bit streams. Hence, SVC provides functionalities such as graceful degradation in lossy transmission environments as well as bit rate, format, and power adaptation. These functionalities provide enhancements to transmission and storage applications. SVC has achieved significant improvements in coding efficiency with an increased degree of supported scalability relative to the scalable profiles of prior video coding standards. This paper provides an overview of the basic concepts for extending H.264/AVC towards SVC. Moreover, the basic tools for providing temporal, spatial, and quality scalability are described in detail and experimentally analyzed regarding their efficiency and complexity.","doi":"10.1109/TCSVT.2007.905532","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/76/4317621/04317636.pdf","startPage":"1103","endPage":"1120","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4317621","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSVT.2007.905532","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Overview of the Scalable Video Coding Extension of the H.264/AVC Standard","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4317636","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2007","displayDocTitle":"Overview of the Scalable Video Coding Extension of the H.264/AVC Standard","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4317636/","publicationDate":"Sept. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"24 September 2007","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"9624816","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4317636/","volume":"17","issue":"9","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 September 2007","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Overview of the Scalable Video Coding Extension of the H.264/AVC Standard","sourcePdf":"17tcsvt09-schwarz.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.097574S","chronDate":"Sept.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"76","isNumber":"4317621","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"76","citationCount":"2588","xplore-issue":"4317621","articleId":"4317636","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4317637,"authors":[{"name":"C.

With this approach, the application layer cooperates with the physical layer to maximize the system performance. First, in physical layer, we propose a new layered video transmission scheme over MIMO: adaptive channel selection (ACS). ACS-MIMO is fundamentally different from parallel transmission MIMO (PT-MIMO). While each bit stream is continuously transmitted through a fixed antenna in PT-MIMO, ACS-MIMO is able to periodically switch each bit stream among multiple antennas. In application layer, Scalable Video Coding (SVC) generates layered bit streams that need prioritized delivery. Then, we obtain the ordering of each subchannel's SNR strength as partial channel information (CI) at the receiver. The partial CI is acquired via the estimated channel state information based on training sequences. The JAPLD strategy we developed in this research shall switch the bit stream automatically to match the ordering of SNR strength for the subchannels. Essentially, we will launch higher priority layer bit stream into higher SNR strength subchannel by the proposed JAPLD algorithm. In this fashion, we can implicitly achieve automatic unequal error protection (UEP) for layered SVC transmission over MIMO system without power control at the transmitter. Experimental results show that the proposed ACS-MIMO system is able to achieve UEP with the obtained partial CI and the reconstructed video peak signal-to-noise ratio demonstrate the performance improvement of the proposed system as compared with open loop PT-MIMO system.","doi":"10.1109/TCSVT.2007.905531","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/76/4317621/04317638.pdf","startPage":"1218","endPage":"1226","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSVT.2007.905531","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4317621","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Scalable H.264/AVC Video Transmission Over MIMO Wireless Systems With Adaptive Channel Selection Based on Partial Channel Information","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4317638","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 September 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4317638/","displayDocTitle":"Scalable H.264/AVC Video Transmission Over MIMO Wireless Systems With Adaptive Channel Selection Based on Partial Channel Information","volume":"17","issue":"9","publicationDate":"Sept. 2007","accessionNumber":"9624818","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4317638/","dateOfInsertion":"24 September 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Scalable H.264/AVC Video Transmission Over MIMO Wireless Systems With Adaptive Channel Selection Based on Partial Channel Information","sourcePdf":"17tcsvt09-song.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.066621S","chronDate":"Sept.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"76","isNumber":"4317621","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"76","citationCount":"102","xplore-issue":"4317621","articleId":"4317638","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":4317639,"authors":[{"name":"Ye-Kui Wang","affiliation":["Nokia Research Center, Tampere, Finland"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/76/4317621/4317639/4317639-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Ye-Kui Wang (M'02) received the B.S. degree in industrial automation from Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China, in 1995 and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from the Graduate School at Beijing, University of Science and Technology of China, Beijing, China, in 2001.","He is currently a Member of Research Staff in Nokia Research Center, Tampere, Finland.

Among other objectives, it aims to support different receiving devices, perhaps connected through a heterogeneous network structure, using a single bit stream. Earlier attempts of standardized scalable video coding, for example in MPEG-2, H.263, or MPEG-4 Visual, have not been commercially successful. Nevertheless, the Joint Video Team has recently focused on the development of the scalable video extensions of H.264/AVC, known as SVC. Some of the key problems of older scalable compression techniques have been solved in SVC and, at the same time, new and compelling use cases for SVC have been identified. While it is certainly important to develop coding tools targeted at high coding efficiency, the design of the features of the interface between the core coding technologies and the system and transport are also of vital importance for the success of SVC. Only through this interface, and novel mechanisms defined therein, applications can take advantage of the scalability features of the coded video signal. This paper provides an overview of the system interface features defined in the SVC specification. We discuss, amongst other features, bit stream structure, extended network abstraction layer (NAL) unit header, and supplemental enhancement information (SEI) messages related to scalability information.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/76/4317621/04317639.pdf","startPage":"1149","endPage":"1163","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","doi":"10.1109/TCSVT.2007.906827","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSVT.2007.906827","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4317621","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4317639","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"System and Transport Interface of SVC","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Static VAr compensators","Scalability","Video coding","Transform coding","Video compression","Streaming media","MPEG 4 Standard","Automatic voltage control","ISO standards","IEC standards"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["video coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["system interface","transport interface","SVC","scalable video coding","heterogeneous network structure","single bit stream","MPEG 2","H.263","MPEG 4 visual","H.264/AVC","core coding","bit stream structure","network abstraction layer","enhancement information messages","scalability information"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["H.264/AVC","network abstraction layer (NAL)","Scalable Video Coding (SVC)","supplemental enhancement information (SEI)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4317639/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 September 2007","displayDocTitle":"System and Transport Interface of SVC","volume":"17","issue":"9","htmlLink":"/document/4317639/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2007","accessionNumber":"9624819","dateOfInsertion":"24 September 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"System and Transport Interface of SVC","sourcePdf":"17tcsvt09-wang.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.100112S","chronDate":"Sept.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"76","isNumber":"4317621","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"76","citationCount":"69","xplore-issue":"4317621","articleId":"4317639","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4317642,"authors":[{"name":"Mathias Wien","affiliation":["Institut f\u00fcr Nachrichtentechnik, RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/76/4317621/4317642/4317642-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Mathias Wien (S'98\u2013M'03) received the diploma and Dr.-Ing. degrees from RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany, in 1997 and 2004, respectively.","From 1997 to 2004, he worked towards the Ph.D. as a Researcher at the Institute of Communications Engineering at RWTH Aachen University, where he is now employed as Senior Research scientist and Head of Administration.

On the other hand, a residual tail is found, which is characterized in terms of programming, switching, and conducting characteristics. The measured behavior is consistent with extrinsic low-resistance paths in the programmable volume, which shunts the high-resistance amorphous phase and prevents reaching a fully reset resistance.

Additionally, noise performance is excellent, with the 4-9 GHz LNA demonstrating <1.75 dB noise figure (NF), the 9-20 GHz LNA <2.75 dB NF and the 20-40 GHz LNA <2.5 dB NF.

The digital envelope modulator is quite similar to a state-of-the-art DAC design, but now it has been optimized to deal with envelope signals. A thermometer-coded envelope DAC has been implemented in a 90 nm digital CMOS process. Measurements of a test chip show the digital envelope modulator to reach an OFDM output power of 5 dBm for 54 Mb/s using 64 QAM at 2.45 GHz and fulfilling EVM specifications and in-band spectral mask requirements using just 12.7 mW from a 1.2 V supply. Combining the digital envelope modulator with an off-chip power amplifier gives an output power of 20.4 dBm, while fulfilling EVM specifications and in-band spectral mask requirements. The output power of the presented envelope DAC can be increased in a re-design by scaling device sizes. The envelope DAC is a key component in a software-defined-radio transmitter.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Digital Envelope Modulator for a WLAN OFDM Polar Transmitter in 90 nm CMOS","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","doi":"10.1109/JSSC.2007.905239","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel5/4/4317684/04317717.pdf","startPage":"2204","endPage":"2211","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSSC.2007.905239","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4317684","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4317717","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4317717/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 September 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2007","displayDocTitle":"A Digital Envelope Modulator for a WLAN OFDM Polar Transmitter in 90 nm CMOS","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"42","issue":"10","htmlLink":"/document/4317717/","dateOfInsertion":"24 September 2007","publicationDate":"Oct. 2007","accessionNumber":"9633487","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Digital Envelope Modulator for a WLAN OFDM Polar Transmitter in 90 nm CMOS","sourcePdf":"42jssc10-vanzeijl.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.063418S","chronDate":"Oct.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"4","isNumber":"4317684","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"50","xplore-issue":"4317684","articleId":"4317717","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4317735,"authors":[{"name":"Gregg H.

Therefore, a physically based procedure to extrapolate crystallization dynamics from high to operation temperatures is required. This paper shows a simple analytical model for predicting the maximum PCM-operation temperature compatible with a ten-year retention lifetime of the device.

On-wafer standards are fabricated on a 0.13 RF CMOS process, and experimental data are measured from 2 to 110 GHz using an HP 8510XF system. The impact of nonideal on-wafer load standards is examined using the deembedded transistor-parameters and the extracted small signal parameters. The errors remaining after the traditional open-short deembedding are numerically evaluated, which become significant above 50 GHz. The solved 4-port network for on-wafer parasitics is indeed reciprocal despite the assumptions of ideal OPEN and SHORT, thus allowing a mathematically simpler reciprocal 4-port solution. The general 4-port solution can also be directly applied to the measured raw S-parameters to remove both system errors and on-wafer parasitics in a single step. Single-step calibration leads to reasonably accurate transistor -parameters, despite the less accurate on-wafer standards compared to precision ISS standards.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","pdfPath":"/iel5/16/4317723/04317757.pdf","startPage":"2706","endPage":"2714","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","doi":"10.1109/TED.2007.904362","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TED.2007.904362","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4317723","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4317757","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A General 4-Port Solution for 110 GHz On-Wafer Transistor Measurements With or Without Impedance Standard Substrate (ISS) Calibration","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Standards","Calibration","Transistors","Equivalent circuits","Measurement uncertainty","Capacitance","Resistors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["calibration","CMOS integrated circuits","field effect MIMIC","integrated circuit measurement","substrates","wafer-scale integration"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["frequency 110 GHz","single-step calibration","on-wafer parasitics","4-port network","deembedded transistor-parameters","nonideal on-wafer load standards","HP 8510XF system","RF CMOS process","impedance standard substrate calibration","on-wafer transistor measurements","size 0.13 nm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Calibration","deembedding","error correction","microwave on-wafer measurements","on-wafer parasitics","RF CMOS","scattering parameters","4-port network"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4317757/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 September 2007","displayDocTitle":"A General 4-Port Solution for 110 GHz On-Wafer Transistor Measurements With or Without Impedance Standard Substrate (ISS) Calibration","volume":"54","issue":"10","htmlLink":"/document/4317757/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2007","accessionNumber":"9610190","dateOfInsertion":"24 September 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A General 4-Port Solution for 110 GHz On-Wafer Transistor Measurements With or Without Impedance Standard Substrate (ISS) Calibration","sourcePdf":"54ted10-wei.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.088212S","chronDate":"Oct.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"16","isNumber":"4317723","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"27","xplore-issue":"4317723","articleId":"4317757","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4317760,"authors":[{"name":"Dajiang Yang","affiliation":["Process Engineering Integration Department, United Microelectronics Corporation (Singapore Branch) Limited, Singapore"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/16/4317723/4317760/4317760-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Dajiang Yang received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in microelectronics from Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, China, in 1997 and 2000, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree in microelectronics from Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, in 2004.","He joined the Technology Development Division, Chartered Semiconductor Manufacturing, as a Process Engineer in 2004, focusing on low-$K$ materials and high-stress nitride development for 65-nm applications.

We found that the junction leakages are the origins of abnormal SRAM leakage, leading to a high direct-drain quiescent current and low function yield at wafer level. Cobalt salicide penetration at active edges is a dominant path for the junction leakage current. Both junction-area-intensive and active-edge-intensive test structures are employed to characterize the junction leakage. The SRAM function failure sites are carefully examined using conducting atomic force microscope and transmission electron microscope techniques. A full-factorial design of experiment (DOE) is implemented to systematically study the influences of Co thickness and temperatures of RTP1 and RTP2 on the junction leakage characteristics. Within the DOE window, it is found that both junction area and junction edge leakages increase with the Co thickness. The RTP1 temperature is critical in controlling Co salicide penetration at the active edge, while the RTP2 temperature is the main factor that affects the junction area leakage. SRAM leakage can be minimized by optimizing the salicide process scheme.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4317760/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 September 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","publicationDate":"Oct. 2007","accessionNumber":"9610191","htmlLink":"/document/4317760/","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"24 September 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"54","issue":"10","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A Comprehensive Study of Cobalt Salicide-Induced SRAM Leakage for 90-nm CMOS Technology","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Comprehensive Study of Cobalt Salicide-Induced SRAM Leakage for 90-nm CMOS Technology","sourcePdf":"54ted10-yang.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.074107S","chronDate":"Oct.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"16","isNumber":"4317723","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4317723","articleId":"4317760","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4317780,"authors":[{"name":"Vijay K.

The results show that CHAMP can achieve better performance than a contention-based MAC protocol using MIMO links.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Distributed Channel Access Scheduling for Ad Hoc Networks using Virtual MIMO","publicationTitle":"2007 16th International Conference on Computer Communications and Networks","doi":"10.1109/ICCCN.2007.4317820","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 16th International Conference on Computer Communications and Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/4317769/4317770/04317820.pdf","startPage":"203","endPage":"209","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCCN.2007.4317820","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4317770","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4317820","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4317820/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Aug. 2007","displayDocTitle":"Distributed Channel Access Scheduling for Ad Hoc Networks using Virtual MIMO","conferenceDate":"13-16 Aug. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4317820/","dateOfInsertion":"24 September 2007","publicationDate":"Aug. 2007","accessionNumber":"9859159","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distributed Channel Access Scheduling for Ad Hoc Networks using Virtual MIMO","confLoc":"Honolulu, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"ICCCN-00-50.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063423S","chronDate":"13-16 Aug. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4317769","isNumber":"4317770","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4317769","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4317770","articleId":"4317820","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4317844,"authors":[{"name":"Ashwin Sampath","affiliation":["Computer Science Department, University of California,\uc2a0Santa Barbara, USA"],"firstName":"Ashwin","lastName":"Sampath","id":"37280816200"},{"name":"Hui Dai","affiliation":["Computer Science Department, University of California,\uc2a0Santa Barbara, USA"],"firstName":"Hui","lastName":"Dai","id":"37715221100"},{"name":"Haitao Zheng","affiliation":["Computer Science Department, University of California,\uc2a0Santa Barbara, USA"],"firstName":"Haitao","lastName":"Zheng","id":"37333494700"},{"name":"Ben Y.

Doubling the data width doesn't double the maximum data throughput, the worst case timing path becomes slower. Feedback in the traditional implementation makes pipelining problematic. However, the on chip data width used for high throughput protocols is constantly increasing. The battle of reducing static power consumption is one factor driving this trend towards wider data paths. This paper discusses a method for pipelining the calculation of CRC's, such as ISO-3309 CRC32. This method allows independent scaling of circuit frequency and data throughput by varying the data width and the number of pipeline stages. Pipeline latency can be traded for area while slightly affecting timing. Additionally it allows calculation over data that isn't the full width of the input. This often happens at the end of the packet, although it could happen in the middle of the packet if data arrival is bursty. Finally, a fortunate side effect is that it offers the ability to efficiently update a known good CRC value where a small subset of data in the packet has changed. This is a function often desired in routers, for example updating the TTL field in IPv4 packets.","doi":"10.1109/ICCCN.2007.4317846","publicationTitle":"2007 16th International Conference on Computer Communications and Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 16th International Conference on Computer Communications and Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/4317769/4317770/04317846.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCCN.2007.4317846","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4317770","startPage":"365","endPage":"370","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Pipelined Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC) Calculation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4317846","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Pipelined Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC) Calculation","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Aug. 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4317846/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"13-16 Aug. 2007","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2007","accessionNumber":"9809886","dateOfInsertion":"24 September 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4317846/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Pipelined Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC) Calculation","confLoc":"Honolulu, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"ICCCN-00-76.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069192S","chronDate":"13-16 Aug. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4317769","isNumber":"4317770","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4317769","citationCount":"24","xplore-issue":"4317770","articleId":"4317846","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4317850,"authors":[{"name":"Sheng Tong","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Integrated Service Networks, Xidian University, China"],"firstName":"Sheng","lastName":"Tong","id":"37415905400"},{"name":"Dengsheng Lin","affiliation":["College of Communication and Information, University of Electronic Science and Technology, China"],"firstName":"Dengsheng","lastName":"Lin","id":"37590231900"},{"name":"Aleksandar Kavcic","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Hawai, USA"],"firstName":"Aleksandar","lastName":"Kavcic","id":"37398699300"},{"name":"Baoming Bai","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Integrated Service Networks, Xidian University, China"],"firstName":"Baoming","lastName":"Bai","id":"37290479800"},{"name":"Li Ping","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, City University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China"],"lastName":"Li Ping","id":"37279033100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1250-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1251-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1095-2055"}],"articleNumber":"4317850","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":300},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4317850","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Error correction codes","Wireless communication","Linear code","Forward error correction","Parity check codes","Delay","Reed-Solomon codes","Concatenated codes","Iterative decoding","Analytical models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["algebraic codes","binary codes","concatenated codes","error correction codes","linear codes","mobile communication","Reed-Solomon codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["short forward error-correcting codes","real-time wireless communication systems","Reed-Solomon codes","concatenated zigzag codes","classical algebraic codes","iterative decodable codes","random binary linear codes","RS"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Reed-Solomon (RS) codes","low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes","Adaptive belief-propagation (ABP)"]}],"abstract":"For real-time wireless communications, short forward error-correcting (FEC) codes are indispensable due to the strict delay requirement.

In this paper, we investigate the bandwidth efficiency and the associated service outage performance for the different relay scenarios, using the system level simulation for a cellular OFDMA-TDD system. It is demonstrated that a capacity gain by an optical repeater which has a simple amplify-and-forwarding capability only could be minimal due to co-channel interference from all repeaters in the neighbor cells, even though they are usually useful for warranting the outage performance with a multiple order of combining gain, especially in the destructive area, e.g., edge of sub-cell coverage. Meanwhile, multi-hop relays are shown to increase the average system capacity (almost doubling the system throughput) by fully reusing the frequency in every relay station, while improving the per-user data rate in the cell edges or heavily shadowed areas.","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 16th International Conference on Computer Communications and Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/4317769/4317770/04317857.pdf","startPage":"430","endPage":"435","publicationTitle":"2007 16th International Conference on Computer Communications and Networks","doi":"10.1109/ICCCN.2007.4317857","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCCN.2007.4317857","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4317770","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4317857","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Relay-enhanced Cellular Performance of OFDMA-TDD System for Mobile Wireless Broadband Services","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Relays","Throughput","Interchannel interference","Repeaters","Cellular networks","Performance gain","Resource management","Research and development","Bandwidth","Stimulated emission"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["broadband networks","cellular radio","cochannel interference","frequency division multiple access","packet radio networks","radio repeaters","relays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["relay-enhanced cellular performance","OFDMA-TDD system","mobile wireless broadband services","multihop relay","MR","cellular mobile packet access system","carrier-to-interference ratio","bandwidth efficiency","optical repeater","amplify-and-forwarding capability","co-channel interference"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4317857/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Aug. 2007","displayDocTitle":"Relay-enhanced Cellular Performance of OFDMA-TDD System for Mobile Wireless Broadband Services","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4317857/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2007","accessionNumber":"9859178","dateOfInsertion":"24 September 2007","conferenceDate":"13-16 Aug. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Relay-enhanced Cellular Performance of OFDMA-TDD System for Mobile Wireless Broadband Services","confLoc":"Honolulu, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"ICCCN-00-87.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053841S","chronDate":"13-16 Aug. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4317769","isNumber":"4317770","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4317769","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"4317770","articleId":"4317857","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4317895,"authors":[{"name":"Baek-Young Choi","affiliation":["University of Missouri, Kansas City, MO, USA"],"firstName":"Baek-Young","lastName":"Choi","id":"37279181300"},{"name":"Sejun Song","affiliation":["Positive Networks, Overland Park, KS, USA"],"firstName":"Sejun","lastName":"Song","id":"37363585900"},{"name":"George Koffler","affiliation":["University of Missouri, Kansas City, MO, USA"],"firstName":"George","lastName":"Koffler","id":"37714325700"},{"name":"Deep Medhi","affiliation":["University of Missouri, Kansas City, MO, USA"],"firstName":"Deep","lastName":"Medhi","id":"37282526900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1250-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1251-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1095-2055"}],"articleNumber":"4317895","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":11,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":256},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Availability","Failure analysis","Cities and towns","Switches","Spine","Computer network reliability","Fault tolerant systems","Hardware","Automation","Filtering"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["IP networks","telecommunication links","telecommunication network reliability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["outage analysis","university campus network","network failure characteristics","network outage characteristics","failure source","trouble-shooting","network availability improvement","access networks","link failure","node outage","redundant network design","link failure events"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4317895","abstract":"Understanding outage and failure characteristics of a network is important to assess the availability of the network, determine failure source for trouble-shooting, and identify weak areas for network availability improvement.

We investigate the aspects of spatial and temporal localities of failures and outages, the relation of link failure and node outage, and the impact of the hierarchical and redundant network design on outage.

However, scheduling parallel applications on large scale clusters is technically challenging due to significant communication latencies and high energy consumption. As such, shortening schedule length and conserving energy consumption are two major concerns in designing economical and environmentally friendly clusters. In this paper, we propose an energy-efficient scheduling algorithm (TDVAS) using the dynamic voltage scaling technique to provide significant energy savings for clusters. The TDVAS algorithm aims at judiciously leveraging processor idle times to lower processor voltages (i.e., the dynamic voltage scaling technique or DVS), thereby reducing energy consumption experienced by parallel applications running on clusters. Reducing processor voltages, however, can inevitably lead to increased execution times of parallel task. The salient feature of the TDVAS algorithm is to tackle this problem by exploiting tasks precedence constraints. Thus, TDVAS applies the DVS technique to parallel tasks followed by idle processor times to conserve energy consumption without increasing schedule lengths of parallel applications. Experimental results clearly show that the TDVAS algorithm is conducive to reducing energy dissipation in large-scale clusters without adversely affecting system performance.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4317905/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Aug. 2007","publicationDate":"Aug. 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"13-16 Aug. 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4317905/","dateOfInsertion":"24 September 2007","accessionNumber":"9847040","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"An Energy-Efficient Scheduling Algorithm Using Dynamic Voltage Scaling for Parallel Applications on Clusters","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Energy-Efficient Scheduling Algorithm Using Dynamic Voltage Scaling for Parallel Applications on Clusters","confLoc":"Honolulu, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"ICCCN-00-135.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054717S","chronDate":"13-16 Aug. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4317769","isNumber":"4317770","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4317769","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"4317770","articleId":"4317905","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4317912,"authors":[{"name":"Amrit Kumar","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Massachusetts, Amherst, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Amrit","lastName":"Kumar","id":"37715624000"},{"name":"Aura Ganz","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Massachusetts, Amherst, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Aura","lastName":"Ganz","id":"37275831500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1250-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1251-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1095-2055"}],"articleNumber":"4317912","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":15},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Mobile ad hoc networks","MIMO","Media Access Protocol","Road accidents","Traffic control","Bandwidth","Wireless application protocol","Ad hoc networks","Telecommunication traffic","Interference suppression"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ad hoc networks","interference suppression","MIMO communication","radio networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["provisioning link layer proportional service differentiation","wireless ad hoc networks","MIMO links","collision free MAC protocol","spatial multiplexing","interference suppression"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we present a collision free MAC protocol for wireless ad-hoc networks with multiple input multiple output (MIMO) links.

Conventional channel estimation algorithms track adaptively time-varying channels using high performance approaches. However, the power consumption for these algorithms are usually tremendous. On the other hand, users usually move with low speeds in most cases and they do not require such a complicated channel tracker. In view of this we classify the moving speeds into three modes. We then propose a multi-mode channel tracking scheme with different complexities and tracking capabilities. A novel inverse mean-square error (IMSE) velocity metric estimator is also provided along with a mode selection procedure to detect the proper tracking mode. Simulation results show that under the OFDMA mode of the IEEE 802.16e-2005 standard, the proposed algorithm can track the velocity variation very well and perform channel estimation using the most efficient tracking mode.

In the conventional mesh network it is a biggest problem of inefficient network channel capacity due to multiple access interference among the mesh routers. In this paper we will propose a novel MIMO mesh network, where the mesh routers support multiple antennas, to avoid multiple access interference and to supply higher network capacity via link multiplexing. As a MIMO transmission scheme, linear (such as Zero-Forcing) and nonlinear (such as Dirty Paper Coding / Successive Interference Cancellation) MIMO algorithm are developed for the proposed mesh network.

Both receivers correctly exploit the covariance among the local decisions to achieve improved performance. We evaluate the receivers' performance in the presence of local-sensor and channel errors due to multiple-access interference (MAI), Rayleigh fading, and noise and show that their performance exceeds that of all of the suboptimal receivers proposed in S.K.

Mobile users are creatures of habits. They tend to repeat their behaviors. Hence, neural networks with its learning and generalization ability may act as a suitable tool to predict the location of a mobile user provided it is trained appropriately by the personal mobility profile. For prediction, a novel hybrid Bayesian neural network model for predicting locations on Cellular Networks (can also be extended to other wireless networks such as Wi-Fi and WiMAX) is suggested. We investigate its different parallel implementation techniques on mobile devices, and compare its performance to many standard neural network techniques such as: Back-propagation, Elman, Resilient, Levenberg-Marqudat, and One-Step Secant models. This approach is free from all unrealistic assumptions about the movement of the users. It is applicable to any arbitrary cell architecture. It attempts to reduce the total location management cost and paging delay. In general, it enhances mobility management in wireless networks (in location management and hand-off management). In our experiments, we compare results of the proposed Bayesian Neural Network with 5 standard neural network techniques in predicting next location. Bayesian learning for Neural Networks predicts location better than standard neural network techniques since it uses well founded probability model to represent uncertainty about the relationship being learned. The result of Bayesian training is a posterior distribution over network weights.","doi":"10.1109/ICCCN.2007.4317989","pdfPath":"/iel5/4317769/4317770/04317989.pdf","startPage":"1234","endPage":"1239","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 16th International Conference on Computer Communications and Networks","publicationTitle":"2007 16th International Conference on Computer Communications and Networks","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCCN.2007.4317989","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4317770","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Bayesian Learning of Neural Networks for Mobile User Position Prediction","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4317989/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Aug. 2007","displayDocTitle":"Bayesian Learning of Neural Networks for Mobile User Position Prediction","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"24 September 2007","accessionNumber":"9859245","publicationDate":"Aug. 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4317989/","conferenceDate":"13-16 Aug. 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Bayesian Learning of Neural Networks for Mobile User Position Prediction","confLoc":"Honolulu, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"ICCCN-00-219.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054637S","chronDate":"13-16 Aug. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4317769","isNumber":"4317770","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4317769","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"4317770","articleId":"4317989","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4318004,"authors":[{"name":"Tom Lamarche","affiliation":["Canadian Space Agency, Saint Hubert, QUE, Canada"],"firstName":"Tom","lastName":"Lamarche","id":"37398666700"},{"name":"Wen-Hong Zhu","affiliation":["Canadian Space Agency, Saint Hubert, QUE, Canada"],"firstName":"Wen-Hong","lastName":"Zhu","id":"37334065500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1250-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1251-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1095-2055"}],"articleNumber":"4318004","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":141},"abstract":"Modular (re-configurable) robots have been studied and developed over two decades. Compared to common industrial robot manipulators, modular robots usually end up showing relatively poorer control performance. This is mainly because most of modular robots' designs typically concentrate on mechatronic interfaces, packaging and re-configurable features, leaving little space for dynamics and control considerations. In our current research frame, we are looking at \"virtual decomposition control\" (VDC) to significantly improve modular robots dynamics and control performance. A key element to successful implementation of the related algorithms has to do with the inter-modules communication link capabilities. Presented here is the first 2 DOF prototype built to demonstrate the feasibility of implementing VDC on a real system, including the Spacewire Bus based communication protocol used.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Communication system control","Communication networks","Orbital robotics","Service robots","Industrial control","Manipulator dynamics","Mechatronics","Packaging","Robot control","Prototypes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["industrial manipulators","manipulator dynamics","protocols","system buses"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["VDC based communication network","modular robot dynamics","re-configurable robots","mechatronic interfaces","virtual decomposition control","modular robot control performance","spacewire bus based communication protocol","industrial robot manipulators","ad hoc protocol"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICCCN.2007.4318004","publicationTitle":"2007 16th International Conference on Computer Communications and Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 16th International Conference on Computer Communications and Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/4317769/4317770/04318004.pdf","startPage":"1321","endPage":"1326","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4317770","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCCN.2007.4318004","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A virtual decomposition control based communication network for modular robots applications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4318004","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A virtual decomposition control based communication network for modular robots applications","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4318004/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4318004/","accessionNumber":"9859252","conferenceDate":"13-16 Aug. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"24 September 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Aug. 2007","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A virtual decomposition control based communication network for modular robots applications","confLoc":"Honolulu, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"ICCCN-00-234.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051464S","chronDate":"13-16 Aug. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4317769","isNumber":"4317770","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4317769","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"4317770","articleId":"4318004","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4318022,"authors":[{"name":"Hsiao-feng Lu","affiliation":["Department of Communications Engineering, National Chung Cheng University, Chiayi, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Hsiao-feng","lastName":"Lu","id":"37274988800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1199-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1200-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4318022","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":48},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fading","Receiving antennas","OFDM","Channel capacity","Frequency domain analysis","Transmitters","Diversity methods","Frequency response","Constellation diagram","Interference constraints"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["block codes","channel capacity","channel coding","diversity reception","multipath channels","OFDM modulation","Rayleigh channels","receiving antennas","space-time codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optimal code constructions","SIMO-OFDM system","frequency selective fading channels","receive antennas","Q subcarriers","Rayleigh channel","multipath channel","channel capacity","power-delay profiles","multiblock space-frequency code","optimal diversity-multiplexing gain"]}],"abstract":"A SIMO-OFDM system with n\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">r</sub>\n receive antennas and Q subcarriers is considered in this paper.

In this paper we give the design of diversity embedded space-time codes for fading Inter-Symbol Interference (ISI) channels with provable rank distance guarantees. In the process of doing so we also get a (asymptotic) characterization of the rate-diversity trade-off for multiple antenna fading ISI channels when there is a fixed transmit alphabet constraint.

We provide a brief survey of theory and state of the art of hybrid ARQ, and present some possible future directions keeping in mind practical considerations.","doi":"10.1109/ITWITWN.2007.4318035","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Information Theory Workshop on Information Theory for Wireless Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Information Theory Workshop on Information Theory for Wireless Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/4318012/4318013/04318035.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ITWITWN.2007.4318035","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4318013","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hybrid ARQ: Theory, State of the Art and Future Directions","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4318035","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Hybrid ARQ: Theory, State of the Art and Future Directions","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-6 July 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4318035/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"1-6 July 2007","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2007","accessionNumber":"9781785","dateOfInsertion":"24 September 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4318035/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hybrid ARQ: Theory, State of the Art and Future Directions","confLoc":"Bergen, Norway","sourcePdf":"ITWITWN-00-22.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.078345S","chronDate":"1-6 July 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4318012","isNumber":"4318013","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4318012","citationCount":"59","xplore-issue":"4318013","articleId":"4318035","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4318036,"authors":[{"name":"J.

In fading channels, this approach introduces diversity gain for the first packet without decreasing the overall code rate. This concept is demonstrated with an implementation based on low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes, and simulations show that this H-ARQ scheme provides a significant increase in coding gain for the first packet, and incurs negligible loss of coding gain for the second packet.","doi":"10.1109/ITWITWN.2007.4318036","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Information Theory Workshop on Information Theory for Wireless Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Information Theory Workshop on Information Theory for Wireless Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/4318012/4318013/04318036.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ITWITWN.2007.4318036","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4318013","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design of Cross-Packet Channel Coding with Low-Density Parity-Check Codes","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4318036","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Design of Cross-Packet Channel Coding with Low-Density Parity-Check Codes","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-6 July 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4318036/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"1-6 July 2007","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2007","accessionNumber":"9781786","dateOfInsertion":"24 September 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4318036/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design of Cross-Packet Channel Coding with Low-Density Parity-Check Codes","confLoc":"Bergen, Norway","sourcePdf":"ITWITWN-00-23.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.119299S","chronDate":"1-6 July 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4318012","isNumber":"4318013","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4318012","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"4318013","articleId":"4318036","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":4318040,"authors":[{"name":"Jyrki Lahtonen","affiliation":["Department of Mathematics, University of Turku, Finland"],"firstName":"Jyrki","lastName":"Lahtonen","id":"37283209600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1199-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1200-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4318040","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":68},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Lattices","Euclidean distance","Algebra","Rayleigh channels","Mathematics","Building materials","Signal processing","Fading","Gaussian noise"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["matrix algebra","MIMO communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dense MIMO matrix lattices","class field theory","cyclic division algebras"]}],"abstract":"Since the cyclic division algebras and their orders have become standard material for researchers seeking to construct good MIMO-lattices.

Above the trivial puncturing method, i.e. switching off the extra layers in the symmetric multiple input-multiple output (MIMO) setting, a more sophisticated yet simple asymmetric construction method is proposed. This method can be converted to produce multi-block space-time codes that achieve the diversity-multiplexing (D-M) tradeoff. It is also shown that maximizing the density of the newly proposed codes is equivalent to minimizing the discriminant of a certain order. The use of the general method is then demonstrated by building explicit, sphere decodable codes using different cyclic division algebras (CDAs). We verify by computer simulations that the newly proposed method can compete with the puncturing method, and in some cases outperforms it. Our conquering construction exploiting maximal orders improves even upon the punctured perfect code and the DjABBA code.","doi":"10.1109/ITWITWN.2007.4318041","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Information Theory Workshop on Information Theory for Wireless Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Information Theory Workshop on Information Theory for Wireless Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/4318012/4318013/04318041.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ITWITWN.2007.4318041","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4318013","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Asymmetric Space-Time Block Codes for MIMO Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4318041","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Asymmetric Space-Time Block Codes for MIMO Systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-6 July 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4318041/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"1-6 July 2007","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2007","accessionNumber":"9781791","dateOfInsertion":"24 September 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4318041/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Asymmetric Space-Time Block Codes for MIMO Systems","confLoc":"Bergen, Norway","sourcePdf":"ITWITWN-00-28.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.096311S","chronDate":"1-6 July 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4318012","isNumber":"4318013","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4318012","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"4318013","articleId":"4318041","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":4318044,"authors":[{"name":"Li Ping","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, City University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Li","lastName":"Ping","id":"37279033100"},{"name":"Peng Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, City University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Peng","lastName":"Wang","id":"37292831100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1199-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1200-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4318044","dbTime":"17 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":155},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Array signal processing","MIMO","Base stations","Mobile antennas","Receiving antennas","Transmitting antennas","Iterative algorithms","Rayleigh channels","Performance gain","Delay effects"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","MIMO communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiuser gain","maximum eigenmode beamforming","MIMO systems","rate constraints","sum-power minimization problem","multiuser multiple-input multiple-output systems","antennas"]}],"abstract":"We consider the sum-power minimization problem for multi-user multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems with rate constraints.

An example shows that other 64-QAM Golay sequences not within this construction can be generated using QPSK Golay sequences with third order algebraic normal form.","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Information Theory Workshop on Information Theory for Wireless Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/4318012/4318013/04318054.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Information Theory Workshop on Information Theory for Wireless Networks","doi":"10.1109/ITWITWN.2007.4318054","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ITWITWN.2007.4318054","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4318013","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4318054","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the Construction of 64-QAM Golay Complementary Sequences","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Quadrature phase shift keying","Upper bound","OFDM","Boolean functions","Quadrature amplitude modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["quadrature amplitude modulation","quadrature phase shift keying","sequences"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["64-QAM Golay complementary sequences","offset pair descriptions","peak envelope power upper bound","QPSK","third order algebraic normal form"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4318054/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-6 July 2007","displayDocTitle":"On the Construction of 64-QAM Golay Complementary Sequences","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4318054/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2007","accessionNumber":"9781804","dateOfInsertion":"24 September 2007","conferenceDate":"1-6 July 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the Construction of 64-QAM Golay Complementary Sequences","confLoc":"Bergen, Norway","sourcePdf":"ITWITWN-00-41.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053546S","chronDate":"1-6 July 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4318012","isNumber":"4318013","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4318012","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"4318013","articleId":"4318054","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4318058,"authors":[{"name":"Alexandre Graell i Amat","affiliation":["Electronics Department, GET/ENST Bretagne, Brest, CS, France"],"firstName":"Alexandre Graell i","lastName":"Amat","id":"37279070400"},{"name":"Charbel Abdel Nour","affiliation":["Electronics Department, GET/ENST Bretagne, CS, France"],"firstName":"Charbel Abdel","lastName":"Nour","id":"37296255500"},{"name":"Catherine Douillard","affiliation":["Electronics Department, GET/ENST Bretagne, CS, France"],"firstName":"Catherine","lastName":"Douillard","id":"37269013300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1199-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1200-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4318058","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":141},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4318058","abstract":"In this paper, serially concatenated continuous phase modulation (CPM) is considered. A concatenated structure consisting of a short extended BCH code as outer code is proposed, targeting a wide choice of spectral efficiencies, ranging from 0.75 to 2.25 bit/s/Hz. A two-step design procedure combining EXIT charts analysis and union bound techniques is used to optimize the association of the outer code and the CPM. An exhaustive study of several quaternary and octal CPM schemes is performed. The proposed concatenated structure offers very low error floors (frame error rate below 10\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">-6</sup>\n) and good performance in the waterfall region for all spectral efficiencies.

We use the recently presented GABBA codes, which are systematically constructed, orthogonally decodable, full-rate, full-diversity space-time block codes, in a distributed fashion. Our scheme is generalized to any number of relays with linear orthogonal decoding in the destination, which make it feasible to employ large number of potential relays to improve diversity order. Assuming BPSK modulation and maximum likelihood (ML) detection, we derive a formula for the bit error probability of the investigated scheme in Rayleigh fading channels.

Nested coding is a recently proposed alternative where, unlike network coding, physical and network layers are jointly designed. We find that for a given network throughput ideal nested coding in many situations can lead to a significant increase in transmission reliability compared to network coding. We also consider the case of feedback and retransmissions when received packets fail to be decoded. For the case of two source nodes it is shown that by using nested codes the expected number of relay transmissions is reduced. However, for a larger number of source nodes the gain depends on the employed nested coding strategy at the relay.","doi":"10.1109/ITWITWN.2007.4318067","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Information Theory Workshop on Information Theory for Wireless Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Information Theory Workshop on Information Theory for Wireless Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/4318012/4318013/04318067.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ITWITWN.2007.4318067","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4318013","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the Performance of Joint and Separate Channel and Network Coding in Wireless Fading Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4318067","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"On the Performance of Joint and Separate Channel and Network Coding in Wireless Fading Networks","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-6 July 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4318067/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"1-6 July 2007","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2007","accessionNumber":"9781817","dateOfInsertion":"24 September 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4318067/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the Performance of Joint and Separate Channel and Network Coding in Wireless Fading Networks","confLoc":"Bergen, Norway","sourcePdf":"ITWITWN-00-54.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055107S","chronDate":"1-6 July 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4318012","isNumber":"4318013","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4318012","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"4318013","articleId":"4318067","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4318108,"authors":[{"name":"Hanady Abdulsalam","affiliation":["School of Computing, Queen''s University, Kingston, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Hanady","lastName":"Abdulsalam","id":"37402211900"},{"name":"David B.

Standard data-mining techniques typically assume that records can be accessed multiple times and so do not naturally extend to streaming data. Algorithms for mining streams must be able to extract all necessary information from records with only one, or perhaps a few, passes over the data. We present the streaming random forests algorithm, an online and incremental stream classification algorithm that extends Breiman's random forests algorithm. The streaming random forests algorithm grows multiple decision trees, and classifies unlabeled records based on the plurality of tree votes. We evaluate the classification accuracy of the streaming random forests algorithm on several datasets, and show that its accuracy is comparable to the standard random forest algorithm.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4318075","publicationTitle":"11th International Database Engineering and Applications Symposium (IDEAS 2007)","displayPublicationTitle":"11th International Database Engineering and Applications Symposium (IDEAS 2007)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4318074/4318075/04318108.pdf","doi":"10.1109/IDEAS.2007.4318108","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IDEAS.2007.4318108","startPage":"225","endPage":"232","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Streaming Random Forests","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"6-8 Sept. 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4318108/","displayDocTitle":"Streaming Random Forests","htmlLink":"/document/4318108/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"6-8 Sept. 2007","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"9877203","dateOfInsertion":"24 September 2007","publicationDate":"Sept. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Streaming Random Forests","confLoc":"Banff, AB, Canada","sourcePdf":"29470225.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066181S","chronDate":"6-8 Sept. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4318074","isNumber":"4318075","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4318074","citationCount":"26","xplore-issue":"4318075","articleId":"4318108","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4318150,"authors":[{"name":"Padraig Corcoran","affiliation":["National Centre for Geocomputation, Department of Computer Science, NUI Maynooth, Finland"],"firstName":"Padraig","lastName":"Corcoran","id":"37893418100"},{"name":"Adam Winstanley","affiliation":["National Centre for Geocomputation, Department of Computer Science, NUI Maynooth, Finland"],"firstName":"Adam","lastName":"Winstanley","id":"37679732900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7695-2887-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-2887-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4318150","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":61},"abstract":"For the watershed segmentation algorithm to be successful it must be implemented on a realistic gradient image. In most watershed implementations, gradients are extracted using an operator optimal for ideal step edges. However, image edges are never ideal steps and more closely resemble ramp edges at multiple scales. Therefore this strategy results in an inaccurate measure of image gradients and in turn lessens segmentation performance. In this paper we propose a new multiscale gradient operator for ramp edges. This strategy merges the properties of accurate gradient estimation of a large scale kernel with accurate localization of a small scale kernel by tracking gradients from larger to smaller scales. Quantitative performance evaluation of segmentation results shows this approach to outperform a traditional single small scale gradient operator optimal for step edges.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Merging","Image edge detection","Image segmentation","Object recognition","Kernel","Layout","Machine vision","Image processing","Computer science","Large-scale systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["gradient methods","image segmentation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiscale ramp edge merging strategy","watershed segmentation algorithm","realistic gradient image","image edges","segmentation performance","multiscale gradient operator","quantitative performance evaluation"]}],"doi":"10.1109/IMVIP.2007.29","publicationTitle":"International Machine Vision and Image Processing Conference (IMVIP 2007)","displayPublicationTitle":"International Machine Vision and Image Processing Conference (IMVIP 2007)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4318122/4318123/04318150.pdf","startPage":"158","endPage":"168","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4318123","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IMVIP.2007.29","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Watershed Segmentation Using a Multiscale Ramp Edge Merging Strategy","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4318150","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Watershed Segmentation Using a Multiscale Ramp Edge Merging Strategy","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4318150/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4318150/","accessionNumber":"9876059","conferenceDate":"5-7 Sept. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"24 September 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-7 Sept. 2007","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Watershed Segmentation Using a Multiscale Ramp Edge Merging Strategy","confLoc":"Kildare, Ireland","sourcePdf":"28870158.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052609S","chronDate":"5-7 Sept. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4318122","isNumber":"4318123","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4318122","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4318123","articleId":"4318150","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4318153,"authors":[{"name":"Yanpeng Cao","affiliation":["University of Manchester, Institute of Science and Technology, UK"],"firstName":"Yanpeng","lastName":"Cao","id":"37713567400"},{"name":"Peter Cook","affiliation":["University of Manchester, Institute of Science and Technology, UK"],"firstName":"Peter","lastName":"Cook","id":"37299002900"},{"name":"Alasdair Renfrew","affiliation":["University of Manchester, Institute of Science and Technology, UK"],"firstName":"Alasdair","lastName":"Renfrew","id":"37267731700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7695-2887-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-2887-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4318153","dbTime":"20 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":196},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4318153","abstract":"This paper presents a visual odometer system using a monocular camera for vehicle navigation. A novel algorithm for vehicle ego-motion estimation based on optical flow and image segmentation is proposed. By applying a pulse-coupled neural network (PCNN), the image is dynamically divided into road area and non-road area by analysing texture smoothness. Correct road region detection effectively reduces computation cost and improves accuracy of ego-motion estimation. Then a novel optical flow optimization method is proposed to produce reliable optical flow field in the road area detected previously. It's known when the vehicle is moving on a planar structured road, its 2D motion field is expected to have specific form. Therefore ego-motion of vehicle, instantaneous speed and angular velocity, can be recovered from optical flow field of road area. Experiments show that the visual odometer successfully provides driver with robust and accurate vehicle self motion information.","doi":"10.1109/IMVIP.2007.36","startPage":"185","endPage":"191","displayPublicationTitle":"International Machine Vision and Image Processing Conference (IMVIP 2007)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4318122/4318123/04318153.pdf","publicationTitle":"International Machine Vision and Image Processing Conference (IMVIP 2007)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IMVIP.2007.36","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4318123","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Vehicle Ego-Motion Estimation by using Pulse-Coupled Neural Network","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Image motion analysis","Optical computing","Optical pulses","Road vehicles","Cameras","Navigation","Image segmentation","Image analysis","Image texture analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distance measurement","image segmentation","image sequences","image texture","motion estimation","neural nets","object detection","road traffic","road vehicles","traffic engineering computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["vehicle ego-motion estimation","pulse-coupled neural network","visual odometer system","monocular camera","vehicle navigation","optical flow","image segmentation","road area","image texture smoothness","road region detection","vehicle self motion information"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4318153/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-7 Sept. 2007","displayDocTitle":"Vehicle Ego-Motion Estimation by using Pulse-Coupled Neural Network","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4318153/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"24 September 2007","conferenceDate":"5-7 Sept. 2007","accessionNumber":"9876062","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Vehicle Ego-Motion Estimation by using Pulse-Coupled Neural Network","confLoc":"Kildare, Ireland","sourcePdf":"28870185.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072186S","chronDate":"5-7 Sept. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4318122","isNumber":"4318123","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4318122","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4318123","articleId":"4318153","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4318203,"authors":[{"name":"Carlos E.

Due to the high performance requirements of sealed electromagnetic relay it is interesting to know not only the temperatures of the conducting parts but also the thermal impact on the plastic components. Therefore, the non-metallic parts of the sealed electromagnetic relay (including the air within the device) are now part of the model. In order to improve the accuracy of simulation, the contact radius is calculated in advance. The relationship between convection heat transfer coefficient and temperature and how to consider connecting wires boundary condition are also researched here.

Most existing denoising schemes are spatio-temporal filters which operate on data over three dimensions. However, to limit the number of inputs, these filters only utilize one reference frame and cannot fully exploit temporal correlation. In this paper, a recursive temporal denoising filter named multihypothesis motion compensated filter (MHMCF) is proposed. To fully exploit temporal correlation, MHMCF performs motion estimation in a number of reference frames to construct multiple hypotheses (temporal predictions) of the current pixel. These hypotheses are combined by weighted averaging to suppress noise and estimate the actual current pixel value. Based on the multihypothesis motion compensated residue model presented in this paper, we investigate the efficiency of MHMCF, and some numerical evaluations are revealed. Experimental results show that MHMCF demonstrates quite good denoising performance while the inputs are much fewer than spatio-temporal filters. Moreover, as a purely temporal filter, it can well preserve spatial details and achieve satisfactory visual quality.","doi":"10.1109/TCSVT.2007.903797","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/76/4318237/04318238.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSVT.2007.903797","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4318237","startPage":"1423","endPage":"1429","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Temporal Video Denoising Based on Multihypothesis Motion Compensation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4318238","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Temporal Video Denoising Based on Multihypothesis Motion Compensation","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4318238/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 October 2007","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"17","issue":"10","publicationDate":"Oct. 2007","accessionNumber":"9624826","dateOfInsertion":"01 October 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4318238/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Temporal Video Denoising Based on Multihypothesis Motion Compensation","sourcePdf":"17tcsvt10-guo.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.132201S","chronDate":"Oct.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"76","isNumber":"4318237","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"76","citationCount":"38","xplore-issue":"4318237","articleId":"4318238","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4318240,"authors":[{"name":"Roman C.

In this paper, we demonstrate a novel affine predictor stage which can be easily incorporated into current codecs greatly increasing MCP quality. If used passively to generate the final prediction, gains of up to 0.7 and 1.6 dB were easily realized for ldquomobilerdquo and ldquoflower gardenrdquo video sequences, respectively.

The high-speed/performance hardware designs for EBCOT are critical to various high-resolution applications, such as digital cameras, digital video recorders, and HDTV, etc. This paper presents a detailed performance analysis for EBCOT Tier-1 and its bit plane parallel architecture design. By analyzing the bit plane parallel context modeling, we conclude that the difference between the output rate of context modeling module and that of arithmetic coding module degrades the performance of whole EBCOT parallel encoding. We propose two improved methods, referred to as data-pairs ordering (DPO) and flexible MQ (FMQ) coder. It solves the configuration problem between the parallel context modeling module and the sequent arithmetic coding module, takes full advantage of the bit plane parallel encoding technique, and improves the coding speed and efficiency of the EBCOT encoder significantly. The design of parallel EBCOT encoder is tested on the field-programmable gate array (FPGA) platform of Altera Company. The simulation results show that it can on average encode 54 million samples at 55-MHz working frequency. It is equivalent to encoding a 90006000 image per second or encoding 720 p (1280times720, 4:2:2) HDTV picture sequence nearly 30 frames per second. Compared with the conventional bit plane parallel architecture design, the proposed one can reduce execution time by 24%.","doi":"10.1109/TCSVT.2007.903789","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/76/4318237/04318255.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSVT.2007.903789","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4318237","startPage":"1336","endPage":"1347","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance Analysis and Architecture Design for Parallel EBCOT Encoder of JPEG2000","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4318255","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Performance Analysis and Architecture Design for Parallel EBCOT Encoder of JPEG2000","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4318255/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 October 2007","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"17","issue":"10","publicationDate":"Oct. 2007","accessionNumber":"9624840","dateOfInsertion":"01 October 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4318255/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance Analysis and Architecture Design for Parallel EBCOT Encoder of JPEG2000","sourcePdf":"17tcsvt10-zhang.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.077435S","chronDate":"Oct.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"76","isNumber":"4318237","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"76","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"4318237","articleId":"4318255","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4318269,"authors":[{"name":"Imad-U-Khan","affiliation":["Electrical Energy and Power System, University of Manchester, Manchester, UK"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/57/4317508/4318269/4318269-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Imad-Ullah-Khan received a BEng.

Computerized tomography is one of the imaging equipments of diagnosis which has most benefited from technological improvements. Because of that, and due to the quality of the diagnosis produced, it is one of the most employed equipments in clinical applications. The ischaemic cerebral vascular accident (ICVA) is the pathology that confirms the frequent use of the computerized tomography. The interest for this pathology, and in general for the encephalon image analysis as a preventive diagnosis, is mainly due to the frequent occurrence of ICV As in development countries and its social-economic impact. In this sense, we propose to evaluate the ability of artificial neural networks (ANN) for automatic identification of ICVA by means of tissue density images obtained by computerised tomography. This work employed cranioencephalon computerised tomography exams and their respective medical reports, to train ANNs classifiers. Features extracted from the images were used as inputs to the classifiers. Once the ANNs were trained, the neural classifiers were tested with data never seen by the network. At this stage we may conclude that the ANNs may significantly contribute as an ICV As computerised tomography diagnostic aid, since among the test cases the automatic identification of ischaemic lesions has been performed with no false negatives e very few false positives.","doi":"10.1109/SOFA.2007.4318302","pdfPath":"/iel5/4318287/4318288/04318302.pdf","startPage":"39","endPage":"43","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 2nd International Workshop on Soft Computing Applications","publicationTitle":"2007 2nd International Workshop on Soft Computing Applications","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SOFA.2007.4318302","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4318288","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improving the Diagnosis of Ischemic CVA's through CT Scan with Neural Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4318302/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-23 Aug. 2007","displayDocTitle":"Improving the Diagnosis of Ischemic CVA's through CT Scan with Neural Networks","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"24 September 2007","accessionNumber":"9778149","publicationDate":"Aug. 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4318302/","conferenceDate":"21-23 Aug. 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improving the Diagnosis of Ischemic CVA's through CT Scan with Neural Networks","confLoc":"Gyula, Hungary","sourcePdf":"SOFA-00-14.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.099786S","chronDate":"21-23 Aug. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4318287","isNumber":"4318288","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4318287","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4318288","articleId":"4318302","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4318310,"authors":[{"name":"Vishal Thareja","affiliation":["School of Information Technology and Engineering, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Vishal","lastName":"Thareja","id":"37691507900"},{"name":"Miodrag Bolic","affiliation":["School of Information Technology and Engineering, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Miodrag","lastName":"Bolic","id":"37396308000"},{"name":"Voicu Groza","affiliation":["School of Information Technology and Engineering, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Voicu","lastName":"Groza","id":"37274793400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1607-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1608-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4318310","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":47},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fuzzy logic","Coprocessors","Hardware","Engines","Inference algorithms","Control systems","Fuzzy control","Reduced instruction set computing","Delay","Design methodology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["coprocessors","fuzzy logic","logic CAD"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fuzzy logic coprocessor design","Handel-C","fuzzy logic algorithm","Celoxica DK design suite","Mamdani-type engine","trapezoid membership function","triangular membership function","pipeline transformation","parallelism transformation"]}],"abstract":"Design and implementation of a fuzzy logic (FL) coprocessor is presented in this paper. The main goal of a FL coprocessor is to speed up the operations typical for FL algorithms. Current implementations of FL algorithms are dedicated and general purpose.

The basic components of the FL coprocessor presented in this paper are designed in Handel-C using Celoxica's DK Design Suite. The inference engine inside the FL coprocessor is a Mamdani-type engine and the FL coprocessor only supports trapezoid and triangular membership functions. With the DK Design Suite, area estimations are analyzed and throughput is increased by applying pipelining and parallelism transformations.","doi":"10.1109/SOFA.2007.4318310","publicationTitle":"2007 2nd International Workshop on Soft Computing Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 2nd International Workshop on Soft Computing Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4318287/4318288/04318310.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SOFA.2007.4318310","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4318288","startPage":"83","endPage":"88","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design of a Fuzzy Logic Coprocessor using Handel-C","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4318310","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Design of a Fuzzy Logic Coprocessor using Handel-C","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-23 Aug. 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4318310/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"21-23 Aug. 2007","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2007","accessionNumber":"9778157","dateOfInsertion":"24 September 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4318310/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design of a Fuzzy Logic Coprocessor using Handel-C","confLoc":"Gyula, Hungary","sourcePdf":"SOFA-00-22.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067907S","chronDate":"21-23 Aug. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4318287","isNumber":"4318288","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4318287","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4318288","articleId":"4318310","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4318317,"authors":[{"name":"Daniela E.

Thus, except for the switch in the section of ZVS-PWM commutation cell, all power semiconductor devices in proposed inverter operate at ZVS turn on and turn off. The switch in the section of ZVS-PWM commutation cell operates at zero-current-switching (ZCS) turn-on and turn-off.

In the FLANN, functional expansion substitutes the hidden layer of multilayer perceptron (MLP). It increases the dimension of the input signal space by polynomials.

In order to solve these practical application problems, a novel model of one-class bearing fault detection based on SVDD and genetic algorithm is presented in this paper. The time domain statistics features are processed as inputs to SVDD for one-class (normal) recognition. Then SVDD is used to describe the normal data distribution characteristics with high data description ability. The SVDD is trained only with a subset of normal samples. This paper also analyzes the behavior of the classifier based on parameter selection and proposes a novel way based on genetic algorithm to determine the optimal threshold parameters. The hybrid one-class classification model of SVDD and genetic algorithm is determined to address the problem of difficultly collecting abnormal samples in bearing fault detection. Comparison of the performance of detection of SVDD with different kernel parameters is experimented. This hybrid approach is compared against other MLP detection techniques. The results show the relative effectiveness of the proposed classifiers in detection of the bearing condition with some concluding remarks.","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 2nd IEEE Conference on Industrial Electronics and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4318334/4318335/04318518.pdf","startPage":"802","endPage":"807","publicationTitle":"2007 2nd IEEE Conference on Industrial Electronics and Applications","doi":"10.1109/ICIEA.2007.4318518","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIEA.2007.4318518","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4318335","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4318518","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Novel Model of one-class Bearing Fault Detection using SVDD and Genetic Algorithm","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fault detection","Genetic algorithms","Industrial electronics","Kernel"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fault diagnosis","genetic algorithms","machine bearings","multilayer perceptrons","power engineering computing","support vector machines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["one-class bearing fault detection","SVDD","support vector data description","genetic algorithm","normal data distribution characteristics","MLP detection","multilayer perceptron"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["fault detection","genetic algorithm","support vector data description","kernel parameters","rotating machines"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4318518/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-25 May 2007","displayDocTitle":"A Novel Model of one-class Bearing Fault Detection using SVDD and Genetic Algorithm","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4318518/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2007","accessionNumber":"9663832","dateOfInsertion":"24 September 2007","conferenceDate":"23-25 May 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Novel Model of one-class Bearing Fault Detection using SVDD and Genetic Algorithm","confLoc":"Harbin, China","sourcePdf":"ICIEA-00-183.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05624S","chronDate":"23-25 May 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4318334","isNumber":"4318335","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4318334","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"4318335","articleId":"4318518","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":4318520,"authors":[{"name":"Xu Li-ying","affiliation":["Changsha University of Science and Technology, Changsha, Hunan, China"],"firstName":"Xu","lastName":"Li-ying","id":"38275329600"},{"name":"Wen Hui","affiliation":["Changsha University of Science and Technology, Changsha, Hunan, China"],"firstName":"Wen","lastName":"Hui","id":"37305858500"},{"name":"Zeng Zhe-zhao","affiliation":["Changsha University of Science and Technology, Changsha, Hunan, China"],"firstName":"Zeng","lastName":"Zhe-zhao","id":"38273590500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-0736-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-0737-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2156-2318"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2158-2297"}],"articleNumber":"4318520","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":250},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Differential equations","Industrial electronics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["differential equations","initial value problems","neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neural networks","initial value problems","ordinary differential equations","cosine basis functions","convergence theorem","modified Euler method","Heun method"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Neural Network","Cosine Basis Functions","Ordinary Differential Equations","convergence theorem"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4318520","abstract":"A new method for solving initial value problems in ordinary differential equations (ODE\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">S</sub>\n) is proposed in this paper.

However to what extent the performance of FACTS devices can be brought out highly depends upon the location and the parameters of the FACTS devices. In this paper, two techniques, a genetic algorithm (GA) technique and a particle swarm optimization (PSO) technique are used to solve this problem. The present research of the paper aims to select the optimal location and the optimal parameter settings of thyristor controlled series capacitor (TCSC) so as to minimize the active power losses in the power network. To show the validity of the proposed techniques, simulations are carried out on several power systems, a three-bus power system, a five-bus power system, and an IEEE-14 bus power system. All the simulations show very encouraging results. The results are presented in the paper together with appropriate discussion.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-25 May 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4318586/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9689371","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4318586/","publicationDate":"May 2007","dateOfInsertion":"24 September 2007","conferenceDate":"23-25 May 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Optimal Location and Parameter Setting of TCSC by Both Genetic Algorithm and Particle Swarm Optimization","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal Location and Parameter Setting of TCSC by Both Genetic Algorithm and Particle Swarm Optimization","confLoc":"Harbin, China","sourcePdf":"ICIEA-00-251.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061335S","chronDate":"23-25 May 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4318334","isNumber":"4318335","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4318334","citationCount":"28","xplore-issue":"4318335","articleId":"4318586","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":4318597,"authors":[{"name":"Yan Cai","affiliation":["School of Computer & Automation, Tianjin Professional University, Tianjin, China"],"firstName":"Yan","lastName":"Cai","id":"37089100015"},{"name":"Chao Gao","affiliation":["China Tex Mechanical and Electrical Engineering Limited, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Chao","lastName":"Gao","id":"37707574300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-0736-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-0737-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2156-2318"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2158-2297"}],"articleNumber":"4318597","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":355},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4318597","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Torque","Reluctance motors","Neural networks","Industrial electronics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["backpropagation","machine control","minimisation","neurocontrollers","reluctance motors","torque control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["torque ripple minimization","switched reluctance motor","instantaneous torque control","static torque characteristics","Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm","commutation strategy","power converter voltage saturation","SRM","inverse torque model","(back propagation neural network)"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Switched reluctance motor","torque ripple minimization","BP neural network","Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm","optimum profiling"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICIEA.2007.4318597","pdfPath":"/iel5/4318334/4318335/04318597.pdf","publicationTitle":"2007 2nd IEEE Conference on Industrial Electronics and Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 2nd IEEE Conference on Industrial Electronics and Applications","startPage":"1198","endPage":"1202","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4318335","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIEA.2007.4318597","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Torque Ripple Minimization in Switched Reluctance Motor Based on BP Neural Network","abstract":"The instantaneous torque control for torque ripple minimization of switched reluctance motor (SRM) by BP neural network is presented.

Due to its generalization ability, network ensemble is widely used in regression and forecasting. The ways that realize the ensemble is numerous, one of them is boosting. Usually the regression methods based on boosting pay a lot of attention on the decrease for residual, but little on generalization ability. Although boosting itself has the property of resisting overfitting, too much focus on the training error decrease would impact the generalization ability method should own. To achieve further improvement of generalization ability and also the speed of convergence for the algorithm, this paper comes up with a modified neural network ensemble method based on boosting. The advantage of the proposed algorithm is mainly represented on the ability of decreasing the generalization error more effectively with the residual small enough. The paper below describes the improving method in detail and roughly gives the proof of its convergence. Based on the simulation experiments, it was found that this method actually could get comparative small generalization error in a more rapid way.","doi":"10.1109/ICIEA.2007.4318612","startPage":"1280","endPage":"1285","publicationTitle":"2007 2nd IEEE Conference on Industrial Electronics and Applications","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIEA.2007.4318612","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4318335","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 2nd IEEE Conference on Industrial Electronics and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4318334/4318335/04318612.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Modified Boosting Based Neural Network Ensemble Method for Regression and Forecasting","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4318612/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A Modified Boosting Based Neural Network Ensemble Method for Regression and Forecasting","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4318612/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9681185","publicationDate":"May 2007","dateOfInsertion":"24 September 2007","conferenceDate":"23-25 May 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-25 May 2007","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Modified Boosting Based Neural Network Ensemble Method for Regression and Forecasting","confLoc":"Harbin, China","sourcePdf":"ICIEA-00-277.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.039265S","chronDate":"23-25 May 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4318334","isNumber":"4318335","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4318334","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4318335","articleId":"4318612","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":4318616,"authors":[{"name":"Guo-zheng Yan","affiliation":["820 Lab, School of Electronics, Information and Electrical Engineering, Shanghai Jiaotong University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Guo-zheng","lastName":"Yan","id":"37288367100"},{"name":"Peng Zan","affiliation":["820 Lab, School of Electronics, Information and Electrical Engineering, Shanghai Jiaotong University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Peng","lastName":"Zan","id":"37660891100"},{"name":"Biao Huang","affiliation":["820 Lab, School of Electronics, Information and Electrical Engineering, Shanghai Jiaotong University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Biao","lastName":"Huang","id":"37708595100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-0736-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-0737-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2156-2318"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2158-2297"}],"articleNumber":"4318616","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":145},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4318616","abstract":"A 3-DOF robot based on inchworm-type motion mechanism is presented for miniature endoscope inspection.

Experimental results show that the optimal gait maximizes dynamic stabilization while it minimizes both energy dissipation and impact to swaying leg from floor.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-25 May 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4318683/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9691086","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4318683/","publicationDate":"May 2007","dateOfInsertion":"24 September 2007","conferenceDate":"23-25 May 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Gait Optimization of Biped Robot Based on Mix-encoding Genetic Algorithm","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Gait Optimization of Biped Robot Based on Mix-encoding Genetic Algorithm","confLoc":"Harbin, China","sourcePdf":"ICIEA-00-348.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.097748S","chronDate":"23-25 May 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4318334","isNumber":"4318335","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4318334","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4318335","articleId":"4318683","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4318715,"authors":[{"name":"Liu Xiankang","affiliation":["Institute of Information and Technology, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Liu","lastName":"Xiankang","id":"37713563500"},{"name":"Gao Meiguo","affiliation":["Institute of Information and Technology, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Gao","lastName":"Meiguo","id":"37299059700"},{"name":"Fu Xiongjun","affiliation":["Institute of Information and Technology, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Fu","lastName":"Xiongjun","id":"37299052400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-0736-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-0737-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2156-2318"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2158-2297"}],"articleNumber":"4318715","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":125},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Satellites","Target recognition","Neural networks","Industrial electronics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["backpropagation","image denoising","image recognition","neural nets","radar imaging","target tracking","wavelet transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["satellite target recognition","BP neural networks","high resolution range profile","backpropogation algorithm","wavelet denoising","denoised HRRP","rank central moments"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["BP Neural Networks","high resolution range profiles","central moments"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4318715","abstract":"For high resolution range profile (HRRP) is sensitive to pose and translation, back-propogation (BP) algorithm is proposed to be used to process even rank central moments of HRRP in target recognition.

The Gaussian model is used to normalize the different sub-characters distance to the shape feature of image and the texture feature of image separately. The shape similarity of images and the texture similarity of images are computed by the Euclidean distance separately. Finally, the weighted sums of the shape similarity of images and the texture similarity of images can be the similarity between the querying image and other images.

Different from the IGA that uses the two-individual mean information entropy for the immune selection, the IIGA assigns the different weight to each term of the total information entropy at the same loci in a pair of individuals, which constructs a better selection scheme and ensures more various individuals to be selected for preserving the diversity of the population. Meanwhile the general expressing form of this kind of selection probability is given.

The lack of energy of some necessary sensor nodes will affect the accurate data aggregation as well as the effective lifetime of the network. In this paper, the problem of predicting which energy level the WSNs or nodes stay in is addressed. Since the primitive method that exchanges messages through nodes could not directly predict the energy level, the stochastic modeling based on hidden Markov model (HMM) is proposed to solve the problem. The energy is divided into several energy levels, i.e. different energy ranges of sensor nodes. Since the state of energy level is the random variable with the value of different energy levels at some time, which holds the characteristic of the Markov chain, it can be modeled as a left-right HMM. Since the energy level cannot be obtained directly, the energy consumption of sensor nodes at a certain time is used as observation states in HMM. Since HMM can perform training process during the running of the WSN, the method can adjust itself to make the best adaptation to the desirable one. Then the trained HMM model can be applied to the prediction of the energy level of the network or sensor nodes. The implementation and simulation of the proposed approach are given in this paper. The simulation shows that the model can effectively predict the energy level and reflect the tendency of the energy consumption, and be applied to other protocols such as energy-efficient routing protocols and so on.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"23-25 May 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4318812/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"9681246","publicationDate":"May 2007","conferenceDate":"23-25 May 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4318812/","dateOfInsertion":"24 September 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"The HMM-based Modeling for the Energy Level Prediction in Wireless Sensor Networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The HMM-based Modeling for the Energy Level Prediction in Wireless Sensor Networks","confLoc":"Harbin, China","sourcePdf":"ICIEA-00-477.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.078741S","chronDate":"23-25 May 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4318334","isNumber":"4318335","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4318334","citationCount":"30","xplore-issue":"4318335","articleId":"4318812","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-06"},{"_id":4318816,"authors":[{"name":"T.

Therefore, the new algorithm is more flexible to work in the environment with noise uncertainties. 2) It provides faster adaptation speed as well as smaller misadjustment.

Therefore, compared with polynomial model based method, the proposed method has an advantage of computational complexity without loss of estimation accuracy.","doi":"10.1109/ICIEA.2007.4318832","publicationTitle":"2007 2nd IEEE Conference on Industrial Electronics and Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 2nd IEEE Conference on Industrial Electronics and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4318334/4318335/04318832.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIEA.2007.4318832","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4318335","startPage":"2358","endPage":"2361","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Low Complexity Polynomial-Model-Based Channel Estimation for MIMO-OFDM Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4318832","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Low Complexity Polynomial-Model-Based Channel Estimation for MIMO-OFDM Systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-25 May 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4318832/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"23-25 May 2007","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2007","accessionNumber":"9663794","dateOfInsertion":"24 September 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4318832/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low Complexity Polynomial-Model-Based Channel Estimation for MIMO-OFDM Systems","confLoc":"Harbin, China","sourcePdf":"ICIEA-00-497.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043992S","chronDate":"23-25 May 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4318334","isNumber":"4318335","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4318334","xplore-issue":"4318335","articleId":"4318832","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4318833,"authors":[{"name":"Chang-Huang Chen","affiliation":["Tung Nan Institute of Technology, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chang-Huang","lastName":"Chen","id":"37716596000"},{"name":"Sheng-Nian Yeh","affiliation":["National Taiwan University of science and Technology, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Sheng-Nian","lastName":"Yeh","id":"37287018300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-0736-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-0737-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2156-2318"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2158-2297"}],"articleNumber":"4318833","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":34},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Particle swarm optimization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["load flow","particle swarm optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["personal best oriented particle swarm optimizer","low-dimensional benchmark functions","nonlinear system of equations","power flow calculation","generator power dispatch"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4318833","abstract":"Personal best oriented particle swarm optimization (PPSO) is a promising optimizer.

The image is partitioned into blocks and each block is processed independently. The data of neighboring blocks are used as overlapped part between neighboring blocks for block wavelet transform to avoid edge artifact. In each overlapped block, in order to reduce the increased operations caused by overlapped part, the spatial combinative lifting algorithm (SCLA) is used for performing the wavelet transform. Compared with the lifting-based global wavelet transform, the memory requirement of this SCLA-based block wavelet transform is reduced to the size of the overlapped block and the multiplication operations are also reduced when the block size is larger than sixteenth of the whole image size. The proposed block wavelet transform method is especially efficient for compressing large sized images.","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 2nd IEEE Conference on Industrial Electronics and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4318334/4318335/04318864.pdf","startPage":"2516","endPage":"2521","publicationTitle":"2007 2nd IEEE Conference on Industrial Electronics and Applications","doi":"10.1109/ICIEA.2007.4318864","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIEA.2007.4318864","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4318335","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4318864","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Spatial Combinative Lifting Algorithm-Based Block Wavelet Transform for Image Compression","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wavelet transforms","Image coding","Industrial electronics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data compression","image coding","lifting","wavelet transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image coding","image compression","SCLA-based block wavelet transform","spatial combinative lifting algorithm"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4318864/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-25 May 2007","displayDocTitle":"Spatial Combinative Lifting Algorithm-Based Block Wavelet Transform for Image Compression","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4318864/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2007","accessionNumber":"9663863","dateOfInsertion":"24 September 2007","conferenceDate":"23-25 May 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spatial Combinative Lifting Algorithm-Based Block Wavelet Transform for Image Compression","confLoc":"Harbin, China","sourcePdf":"ICIEA-00-529.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.07149S","chronDate":"23-25 May 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4318334","isNumber":"4318335","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4318334","xplore-issue":"4318335","articleId":"4318864","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4318909,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaodong Liu","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Power Electronics and Motion Control, Anhui University of Science and Technology, China"],"firstName":"Xiaodong","lastName":"Liu","id":"37539075200"},{"name":"Shubo Li","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Power Electronics and Motion Control, Anhui University of Science and Technology, China"],"firstName":"Shubo","lastName":"Li","id":"37715559000"},{"name":"Yanyan Shi","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Power Electronics and Motion Control, Anhui University of Science and Technology, China"],"firstName":"Yanyan","lastName":"Shi","id":"37693166000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-0736-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-0737-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2156-2318"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2158-2297"}],"articleNumber":"4318909","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":208},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Signal generators","Power amplifiers","Control systems","Power generation","Hybrid power systems","Frequency","Phase noise","Computer architecture","Microcontrollers","Digital signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["digital signal processing chips","function generators","microcontrollers","phase noise","power amplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["arbitrary waveform generator","switch-linear hybrid flexible waveform power amplifier","fast setting time","high frequency resolution","continuous-phase","short switching time","low phase noise","microcontroller","DSP"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4318909","abstract":"To generate the reference waveforms of the switch-linear hybrid flexible waveform power amplifier, an arbitrary waveform generator is implemented in this paper.

The access points (APs) are assumed to be equipped with multiple antennas capable of both transmit and receive beamforming. A nonlinear optimization problem is formulated, which maximizes the fair throughput of the APs in the network under the routing and the PHY/MAC constraints. Dual decomposition is employed to decouple the original problem into smaller subproblems in different layers, which are coordinated by the dual prices. The network layer subproblem can be solved in a distributed manner and the PHY layer subproblem in a semidistributed manner. To solve the PHY layer subproblem, an iterative minimum mean square error (IMMSE) algorithm is used with the target link signal-to-interference-and-noise-ratio (SINR) set dynamically based on the price generated from the upper layers. A scheduling heuristic is also developed, which improves the choice of the transmission sets over time. Simulation results illustrate the efficacy of the proposed cross-layer design.","doi":"10.1109/TMC.2007.1052","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/7755/4318958/04318966.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMC.2007.1052","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4318958","startPage":"1259","endPage":"1269","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cross-Layer Design of Wireless Multihop Backhaul Networks With Multiantenna Beamforming","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4318966","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Cross-Layer Design of Wireless Multihop Backhaul Networks With Multiantenna Beamforming","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4318966/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 October 2007","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"6","issue":"11","publicationDate":"Nov. 2007","accessionNumber":"9705927","dateOfInsertion":"01 October 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4318966/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cross-Layer Design of Wireless Multihop Backhaul Networks With Multiantenna Beamforming","sourcePdf":"h1259.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.074305S","chronDate":"Nov.  2007","isNumber":"4318958","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7755","citationCount":"19","articleId":"4318966","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4318981,"authors":[{"name":"Chong Hee Kim","affiliation":["UCL Crypto Group, Universit\u00e9 Catholique de Louvain, Louvain-la-Neuve, Belgium"],"firstName":"Chong Hee","lastName":"Kim","id":"37715711600"},{"name":"Jean-Jacques Quisquater","affiliation":["UCL Crypto Group, Universit\u00e9 Catholique de Louvain, Louvain-la-Neuve, Belgium"],"firstName":"Jean-Jacques","lastName":"Quisquater","id":"37282338400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7695-2982-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-2982-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4318981","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":26,"citationCountPatent":3,"totalDownloads":661},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4318981","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cryptography","Electromagnetic analysis","Smart cards","Embedded computing","Algorithm design and analysis","Information analysis","X-ray lasers","Fault diagnosis","Energy consumption","Electromagnetic fields"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","public key cryptography"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["side channel analysis","fault attack","RSA cryptosystem","simple power analysis","exponentiation algorithm","differential power analysis","time complexity","Chinese remainder theorem","RSA-CRT"]}],"abstract":"RSA cryptosystem is one of the most widely used algorithms nowadays. However when it is implemented in embedded devices such as smart cards, it can be vulnerable to power analysis attacks and fault attacks. To defeat all known side channel attacks and fault attacks, several countermeasures should be used together. However due to the low computation capability of the embedded devices, we have to find the best solution or combination among countermeasures. Furthermore, we should be careful since a countermeasure may produce another new vulnerability such as Yen et. al.'s safe-error attack in a simple power analysis (SPA) countermeasure. In 2005, Giraud proposed a scheme secure against simple power analysis as well as fault attack (FA). Afterwards, Fumaroli and Vigilant proposed an exponentiation algorithm secure against differential power analysis (DPA) as well as simple power analysis and fault attack with almost 1.5 times increase in time complexity compared to Giraud's. To the authors' best knowledge, it was a first trial to prevent SPA, DPA, and FA simultaneously on exponentiation with one solution.

For this reason, several schemes for fault detection of the transformations and rounds in the encryption and decryption of the Advanced Encryption Standard are proposed. In this paper, we present a structure-independent fault detection scheme for the Advanced Encryption Standard. The proposed scheme is independent of the way S- box (inverse S-box) is constructed and can be used for both encryption and decryption. It can be applied to both the S-boxes (and inverse S-boxes) using look-up tables as well as those utilizing logic gate implementations based on composite fields. We have obtained the formulations for the fault detection of the SubBytes (inverse SubBytes) using the relation between the input and output of the S-box (inverse S-box). Then, we have proposed and simulated a signature-based structure-independent fault detection scheme. Moreover, the FPGA implementations of the original and the proposed schemes as well as their overhead are presented.","doi":"10.1109/FDTC.2007.15","publicationTitle":"Workshop on Fault Diagnosis and Tolerance in Cryptography (FDTC 2007)","displayPublicationTitle":"Workshop on Fault Diagnosis and Tolerance in Cryptography (FDTC 2007)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4318971/4318972/04318984.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FDTC.2007.15","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4318972","startPage":"47","endPage":"53","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Structure-independent Approach for Fault Detection Hardware Implementations of the Advanced Encryption Standard","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4318984","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A Structure-independent Approach for Fault Detection Hardware Implementations of the Advanced Encryption Standard","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-10 Sept. 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4318984/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"10-10 Sept. 2007","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2007","accessionNumber":"9878693","dateOfInsertion":"01 October 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4318984/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Structure-independent Approach for Fault Detection Hardware Implementations of the Advanced Encryption Standard","confLoc":"Vienna, Austria","sourcePdf":"29820047.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.202731S","chronDate":"10-10 Sept. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4318971","isNumber":"4318972","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4318971","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"4318972","articleId":"4318984","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":4318985,"authors":[{"name":"P.

Analysis are most of the time focused either on passive attack (side channel attack) or on active attacks (fault attack). In this article, a combination of both attacks is presented. It is named PACA for Passive and Active Combined Attacks. This new class of attacks allows us to recover the secret key with only one curve of leakages. Practical results on a secure implementation of RSA have been obtained and are presented here.
